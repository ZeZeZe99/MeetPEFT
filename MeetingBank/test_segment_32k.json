        "source": "Speaker 8: Think there was a lot of deliberation about what type of or what the structure would have, whether it would be a very formal structure that was going to be limited by the Brown Act and agenda, easing meetings and limiting the amount of time for speakers versus allowing for a more fluid process where the community could structure the\nSpeaker 8: way in which they held meetings. Obviously, I think with with the ability to schedule a Brown act, a Brown act, meetings, agendas and all of that as well. And so I just want to put that out there, that that was part of consideration in terms of the structure of the committee itself.\nSpeaker 8: I think there is. I also want to acknowledge the public concern around how people get selected and who's part of that process. I think it's difficult to figure that out. Ultimately, somebody or a group of people have to make a decision.\nSpeaker 8: I think part of this exercise for me has been about letting go and not dictating who's involved or what the outcomes are, but really surrendering to the community led process and allowing for as much input as possible. And for different individuals who aren't necessarily always involved in these conversations to be leading and framing the conversation.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And I just want to echo that. And also my thanks to Councilmember Vela and city manager, Assistant City Manager Bowden and city manager Eric Leavitt was in these meetings, too. But I. I would certainly like to see a robust ability for people to I don't know what email the city manager the assistant city manager and\nSpeaker 0: say I'm interested. I believe people have already been doing that without even knowing what we're doing moving forward. But I hope and maybe Assistant City Manager can tell us more that the selection would actually be made by people of color advising you as opposed to staff.\nSpeaker 0: And we've heard a lot about how these decisions can be made. But I'm also really excited that I've been hearing from people who are not typically involved that I didn't even know before and just saying, I want to step up and be involved.\nSpeaker 0: And so anyway, it's there. And Assistant City Manager Bowden, did you want to do you want to just. Well, I should say I'm sure we have public comment and we should ask our clarifying questions and then we'll hear public comment and we'll come back for a discussion.\nSpeaker 0: So I see the vice mayor. Stand up. Vice mayor.\nSpeaker 4: Thanks. All right. I guess the one question I have that I'd love to hear from the steering committee a little bit more is I heard that going with this process allows this not to be a brown act. Buddy.\nSpeaker 4: And to me, the key aspect of the Brown Act is notification and making sure that meetings are public. Right. And that's and we can if we have to get into that, why we're being very vague, but we can't give any direction for this to remain this kind of kind of a body.\nSpeaker 4: Because I'm wondering if we can talk a little bit about that, because to me, I would have expected that this would be the kind of thing that we want very well publicized and noticed. And I'm not clear how the Brown Act is, is the thing we need to be trying to get around.\nSpeaker 0: So what I heard from some members of the community, some members of the community who reached out, is that there needs to be a certain size of each subcommittee determined because if it's too large, the ability for making decisions and having a.\nSpeaker 0: A full, meaningful discussion is is just diluted. And so and I don't know what that perfect number is. And again, that's one of those where I would defer to the people who are going to be involved, some sort that that they would like some time out of the public side to just bat around some issues, sometimes, you\nSpeaker 0: know, sensitive topics that they might not always want to that that maybe until they've batted them around a little, weren't ready for public consumption. But it definitely doesn't mean that they would meet in secret and then come to the council.\nSpeaker 0: I think my sense of it is that these groups would somehow meet and form a council member. Vela has her hand up, so maybe she'd like to add clarification. Did you want to jump in now?\nSpeaker 8: I think there's a couple of aspects. One is the timing involved around getting agendas out and what that would require in terms of the lead time for them to actually agendas meetings and could perhaps hamper their ability to have a number of smaller meetings with various groups who might not feel comfortable speaking on the record in a\nSpeaker 8: in a public way. I think being sensitive to the fact that there may be members of our community who would like to have certain aspects of conversations be held in a in a smaller listening setting. And one thing I'd like to reference is for the truth and reconciliation process, is that some members of our community have suggested\nSpeaker 8: or alluded to this is exactly what they did. They formed essentially listening committees, subcommittees that went out and did a listening tour and met with a variety of different groups, met them on their turf. I think there's other constraints around the Brown Act, where the meeting takes place, how it's televised, who has access to it, that sort\nSpeaker 8: of thing. The process that was followed in Charleston and in Colorado Springs, for instance, involved having essentially known these commissions committees who would go out and have these conversations again. They're not precluded from having a Brown Act agenda meeting.\nSpeaker 8: I think that would certainly I think that's falls within the line of some of the expectations that have been laid out, is that there be a transparent process, that they that they come forward and make presentations, that they have formal meetings as well.\nSpeaker 8: It's just that through this process, they don't have to do that for all of their meetings. Additionally, there's certain constraints in terms of how meetings are run. You can go out and have an informal conversation, let's say, with the youth or with a small group from an apartment complex.\nSpeaker 8: And the conversation wouldn't necessarily be stilted by having to limit or times have a discussion, that sort of thing. Obviously, they could have work sessions. We have work sessions where we we don't necessarily we can suspend certain rules, but this would allow for that as well.\nSpeaker 8: And so that's where we came up against those things and we said, do we want this to be a heavily bureaucratic process that has that might make it uncomfortable for certain individuals, black, indigenous people of color, people who have felt like they're they might not be ready to have certain conversations publicly.\nSpeaker 8: Is there a way for us to kind of look at this and create a place that they would be safe to participate or feel safe to participate while also having the ability to have these publicly agendas, very transparent meetings.\nSpeaker 0: And just to emphasize to the vice mayor's question, these were suggestions that came to us from black community members. So we were carrying them on to you. But the Council will give direction and input to the the city manager.\nSpeaker 0: Assistant City Manager.\nSpeaker 4: Well, so can I ask a question, please? Yes. My understanding is we can't give any direction to the city manager or this whole process falls apart.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yes. The. Let's see. We are we're receiving a. City attorneys can clarify for us, if you would, please.\nSpeaker 4: I'm happy to provide a.\nSpeaker 6: I'm so sorry to.\nSpeaker 4: Provide.\nSpeaker 6: Suggestions.\nSpeaker 4: I highly encourage those not to be.\nSpeaker 6: Direction suggestions that the city manager could either take or leave is key because this is a city manager driven process is welcome to take input from the community, from the council, from anyone else who wishes. And at.\nSpeaker 4: The end of the day, he'll make a determination on how to form this group and then go forward and do the work that he will.\nSpeaker 6: Task them to do. And so suggestions are okay.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Did that answer your question, Vice Mayor? Okay. And other clarifying questions. So Madame Toni Councilmember, they said, did you have a hand up? No. Okay. And if I don't see it, I'm going to ask. So I would imagine we have some public comment.\nSpeaker 1: Sorry I was needed. So no one on Zoom has raised their hand. Now they're starting to raise their hand. Okay, so anyone on Zoom, please raise your hand. The first one is Melody Montgomery.\nSpeaker 0: And can you just tell me how many we have all together? Because that'll help us with timing.\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Melody has been the first to raise her hand, and then we have four written comments. So that's 3 minutes each because it's under 703 now. Now we have three people who raise their hands. So we're at seven.\nSpeaker 1: So it's 2 minutes each. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: 2 minutes each. Hello, Miss Montgomery. Hi. Hi.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks again. I think my question is directly to the city manager or for guidance. How do we as citizens become involved? What is the process? Because I still haven't heard out. Heard it laid out directly. So that's my question.\nSpeaker 3: How we as citizens become involved in any of these committees.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. That I know they're taking notes as that question and. Well, yes. And we can. We're listening. They are listening. Staff is listening.\nSpeaker 3: Were you.\nSpeaker 0: I think she was finished. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think so. Yes, I think so.\nSpeaker 0: All right.\nSpeaker 1: Hopefully. Oak Grove. Our women. Brown.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. So I have two specific questions for, I guess, the city manager, which is one, this echoes some of the comments made earlier. Also. There seems to be a general collective unclarity about how to engage with subcommittees.\nSpeaker 3: And then this in particular is also unclear. So I'm wondering if you could release some very clear public document, maybe not written like a staff report, which is great for council, but less so for a general public, really clarifying the process in ways that's clear because even I still.\nSpeaker 3: Don't fully understand. And I've spent a lot of time reading and talking about it and also. And. What was the. Oh, and then a question is if how as the public at any point in this in the process, if something happens, you are the person able to hire and fire police.\nSpeaker 3: And this the various subcommittees are going to be making comments. But I'm curious how what's the pathway of engagement if, say, general citizens don't agree with what's happening with the subcommittees or if a city manager does not take the recommendations given by the subcommittees?\nSpeaker 3: That is not that clear either about what these subcommittees would do in terms of enforcement. Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: Next is Alexia Rocha.\nSpeaker 0: Hello.\nSpeaker 3: Hello again. I am concerned that weeks and we are looking at an appointment of a subcommittee that will then appoint various task forces that mainly seem to revolve around review and maybe data, but not enough action. I am also concerned about the amount of autonomy the city manager appears to have in appointing a subcommittee.\nSpeaker 3: There's already plenty of data and reviews regarding policing policies and racism, specifically in towns and cities similar to Alameda. So it's unclear why folks still feel we are so unique or immune to racist policing practices. The community has spoken time and time again, especially last week, regarding the resolution that disappointingly did not pass.\nSpeaker 3: This plan tonight has limited detail on how the community, the committee will be chosen and and the rest of the task force's. It's very unclear. It claims it's community wide, but there's no definition of what that means. Will these groups be reflective of the island's makeup?\nSpeaker 3: Will these groups be reflective of the marginalized communities impacted by these issues? Or will these folks be primarily those with privilege and access to the people who are choosing? For example, if folks are already emailing and that assumes that they have access and whatnot.\nSpeaker 3: I think that how much time there has been and the urgency needed there needs to be more clarity and this needs to be action oriented. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Next is Jennifer Rakowski.\nSpeaker 0: Hello.\nSpeaker 3: Hello. Thank you again. I want to actually get a community member who has been very interested in this issue because I have been very impacted by the issues that these task forces and community groups will be addressing and that there is still this feistiness around sort of the different roles, the different authorities, the time commitment.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm particularly concerned for folks who are marginalized. They're trying to put food on the table. They may or may not be working still and trying to make judgments of how much time they can give that clarity of expectations and avenues for real, meaningful input from people who are most impacted gets through in what feels right now\nSpeaker 3: like a pretty bureaucratic process. And so I do encourage this move forward that, as the prior speaker said, that we move out of sort of these formal meeting minute type roles to have sort of real ordinary communications with our communities and encourage multiple levels of participation that have an awareness of constraints of economics, jobs and things that\nSpeaker 3: might be barriers to entry into the system for the very people who are most impacted.\nSpeaker 1: That's time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 1: That is all for Zoom. And then we will read the public comments. First is carli state of meaning? Hello, mayor, vice mayor and council members. Well, it has been almost two months since Molly Watkins was illegally arrested and the same amount of time since George Floyd was murdered.\nSpeaker 1: While other city councils around the Bay Area have already taken concrete steps towards reimagining public safety. The Alameda City Council is still discussing forming committees to appoint committees. Justice delayed is justice denied. The City Council needs to take action now to declare racism an emergency and start taking concrete actions to counteract racism in our community.\nSpeaker 1: I also am concerned with the current proposal to have the city manager be responsible for selecting all of the steering committee members who will then select the members of the various task forces. The Council needs to instead set up a process where the community gets to choose the steering committee members.\nSpeaker 1: I suggest doing so by having the council or city manager with community input select various local stakeholder organizations such as the League of Women Voters, the local ACLU group, the Alameda Point, Collaborative, local faith leaders or communities, and have each organization entity select a steering group member.\nSpeaker 1: That way, the steering committee will truly be community led. Thank you. Next to Seth Marvin. I'm writing to support the resolution before the council tonight to release Paul O'Leary from his role as Alameda police chief. The chief's got to go under Chief Roll Aries leadership.\nSpeaker 1: Alameda has only grown in reputation as a son downtown, meaning a place where people of color don't want to be caught after dark for fear of being treated the way Mr. Molly Watkins was treated. Is that the Alameda you want to live in?\nSpeaker 1: The videos clearly demonstrate and the district attorney has now confirmed Mr. Watkins was unlawfully detained and unlawfully arrested. He was also disrespected, provoked and then assaulted. Chief Roll Airey has taken no responsibility for this. He should have declared outright that what happened to Mr. Watkins was clearly unlawful and shameful.\nSpeaker 1: And this was only the most recent incident that was caught on video. The chief's gotta go. His inflated salary and benefits package alone should be reason enough. It's way more than that of chiefs in much larger cities. The chief's gotta go.\nSpeaker 1: Chief roll area also demonstrated he's willing to give the appearance of making sweeping changes without any input from the community or council. He's also demonstrated he's willing to use paid time to lobby the city council by soliciting emails from supporters and then forwarding them to the city clerk.\nSpeaker 1: We see that he wants to keep his power, to keep his status, and he wants to keep his budget. But he's also actively working to undercut much needed change within the police department. The chief's gotta go. His continued leadership of the Alameda police is a danger to Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: And. Next is Savannah Cheer. Good evening. While I appreciate that there were some initial efforts made to address transforming Almeida's vision of public safety. I'm very concerned with how these efforts are starting out. If this entire process was meant to be community led and sourced, how come the community wasn't engaged by the subcommittee?\nSpeaker 1: If that engagement is instead going to be left to the city manager and the formation of the steering committee. What was the purpose of the work done on this for the past four weeks? What are the specific ways in which you will amplify the needs and contributions of black Alameda and Alameda INS who have experienced harm from\nSpeaker 1: policing and have been most affected by oppressive systems? I am hoping that you will provide a great deal more detail in tonight's discussion. As it stands, what was published in tonight's agenda is insufficient. Coupled with your total bungle of last week's Public Health Emergency Resolution.\nSpeaker 1: Things are looking great in our city's pursuit of racial justice. As you've heard me and countless others comment in the past six weeks or so. There is no time to wait. Marilyn, you invoked the heroic and beloved John Lewis earlier and said precisely what I would like to know.\nSpeaker 1: If not now. When? When? I hope that you'll be able to answer that question tonight in your discussion of this topic coming out of this meeting, it should be abundantly clear when we're going to see action taken on divesting from policing and investing in our community.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And last is Dorothy Marvin. Dear City Council. Given that the Council agreed last week that racism is a public health emergency, I would suggest that health care providers voices are included in the steering committee. I further suggest that each steering subcommittee is comprised of at least 50% bipoc and that we compensate members of the steering\nSpeaker 1: committee. This will help create inclusive structures that support diverse participation and avoid exacerbating the minority tax. And that's all.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So with that, I closed public comment. And I am always impressed with the the depth of the comments that we get, many of the comments that we get. And I wanted to just address a few things that jogged jogged my memory.\nSpeaker 0: So, I mean, I'm happy to hear more from the assistant city manager, the city manager about that. I know you were taking notes, but I think that the public asked some good questions about how is this going to be an open process for application.\nSpeaker 0: What I would say is this is the first time we've done something like this, at least in recent memory. There may have been previous councils, but not not in the time that I've been involved in city government. So it's an ambitious undertaking.\nSpeaker 0: I think it was Jennifer Rakowski raised some questions that we had. Councilmember Bell and I had certainly raised in our meetings with city management that what are the reasons? And this is something that the community members have spoken to us and I think or would like to be that the city manager had spoken with about.\nSpeaker 0: Taking the lead in this community members, not him is one of the the things that you look at if everything starts out to be Brown act is just the length of meetings. And so while tonight council we would have spent what 7 hours in a meeting, not all on this one topic, but any of these topics could\nSpeaker 0: certainly run a number of hours, especially with lots of public comment. Again, not to say never any public comment, but but if we've heard even people calling for let's move out of formal meeting roles to have real ordinary communication, I think that was the sort of first level that that people were interested in doing, however.\nSpeaker 0: So the time commitment is something we have to be respectful of. We knew what we signed up for when we went. We might not have realized the full extent of it, but we ran for office. But these are community volunteers.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Val and I would like to find a way that there be stipends paid perhaps to those who participate or meals provided. I mean, even though you'd be doing this from your home because we're not having in-person meals any time, if you know that there's ways to to be respectful around that.\nSpeaker 0: But anyway, what what other suggestions.\nSpeaker 3: That Madame Mayor and I think that direction was that that.\nSpeaker 8: Direction was expressly given by the Council at previous meetings where we authorized the use of stipends, making sure that equipment was available for people so that if they were going to do Zoom meetings, they would be provided with technology to do that and things like that.\nSpeaker 8: I think the council unanimously, I believe, gave that authorization in June. So I do want to put that out there for people that are trying to connect. How does all this fit in together? But I do think it would be helpful for staff to talk a little bit about the selection process, how people let let it be\nSpeaker 8: known that they're interested, that sort of thing. And I know we talked about it within the subcommittee generally, which is kind of generally what that would look like. I do want to also address there. There's some people that are saying, can you just make the change?\nSpeaker 8: Now, it's hard to have it be a community led process as the council is just giving direction on changes. So I think this is trying to strike that balance. I also think, and I believe there was direction previously given about including black, indigenous and people of color and centering these voices in this process.\nSpeaker 8: And then also that, you know, there's on the one hand, people don't want politicians and electeds involved in these in these committees. They want it to be community led. And then on the other hand, or you know, and by the way, I got emails from people, I got, you know, calls from folks.\nSpeaker 8: That's who I heard from our people that reached out throughout this process. But if we if we as council start selecting individuals for who's involved, then it becomes this very bureaucratic Brown Act process. And for people that are concerned about timelines, for the community to get back and make recommendations through the city manager and to the Council\nSpeaker 8: about actions, concrete actions we can take, that's going to prolong the process.\nSpeaker 6: Councilmember Odie mean just a question through the chair. I mean there was a suggestion from I think maybe more than one of the four live commenters that the subcommittee involved. I mean, does that also entail as much bureaucracy and, you know, bring bring the process into the purview of the Brown Act?\nSpeaker 6: Or do you still have that flexibility? If we just said, you know, it's the city manager with the two of you or not? I don't know. I'm just asking.\nSpeaker 0: Let's hear from the city attorney, Mr. Shin.\nSpeaker 4: We believe that if any council.\nSpeaker 6: Members are involved in the selection process, whether one or two, it will be a Brown committee.\nSpeaker 0: And I would just say in answer to your question, Council member Odie, I, I have a lot of faith in who I think would be the steering committee to reach out. And I mean, well, not only to reach out but to receive any and all applications.\nSpeaker 0: And I think just because I just want to I do want to touch on something that Councilor Vella said that I know people want this done yesterday, but I just want you to know that we hear a lot about what other cities are doing.\nSpeaker 0: I will tell you that tonight the Oakland City Council is considering their task force to move forward with speed and diligence on reimagining public safety task force. That's the task force. And they have the following project timelines. September 29th, 2020 is the introduction of the task force and December 31 is the draft task force recommendations presented to\nSpeaker 0: the Council March 31. I think we've what we've lined out, lined up what was in the staff report about short, medium and long term goals. Some things we can accomplish more quickly. Others take a little more time. And we've heard other members of this body say, you can do things faster, you can do things well, but you\nSpeaker 0: can't always do both of them at the same time. Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 6: I'm going to when it's time for comment, I'll make my comment on that. But so then I thought the four live speakers, they all were good, but the four speakers ask them questions that. I don't know. Are we able to answer those?\nSpeaker 6: Because there is some concern about like who speaks for for who. And I'd like to make sure that, you know, the the voiceless are have an opportunity to participate. I mean, Melanie mentioned that both times that in her comments and, you know, her and I had a discussion today about it, I open open disclosure.\nSpeaker 6: So, I mean, that's a concern.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm maybe.\nSpeaker 3: You can talk about it.\nSpeaker 6: Maybe you can't. But let me out here. I'll listen.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, I'm I'm pointing that to staff. And I am I do hope Ms.. Montgomery is going to apply in whatever format there is. But staff, I think we've come to the point where we could use a little information for you so we can make informed suggestions.\nSpeaker 0: Ah, but counsel. Oh, they are. There are 4 minutes left until midnight and I know we said we would go to midnight. Do we want to give ourselves a little more time on this item? The other option that the city clerk and I discussed briefly earlier today is that if we had to continue to another, can you\nSpeaker 0: change the meeting to another date? Thursday of this week is a possibility. But I've seen shaking heads so. Okay. Councilmember Ody if with what to what motion.\nSpeaker 6: I'd like to at least go to the 1230 because I think we have some momentum on this topic and you know, we all are like, I know it's late, but I'm kind of engaged in it, so. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: So there is a motion to extend to 1230, is it.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. And then, you know, maybe we can consider maybe tacking it on to Saturday or something.\nSpeaker 3: Oh.\nSpeaker 0: And the vice mayor has his hand up his knee. Okay. So it's been moved. It's been seconded. Any discussion since then? We have a roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember de SAG. I like.\nSpeaker 4: My.\nSpeaker 1: Own. I though.\nSpeaker 8: I.\nSpeaker 1: May be Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 0: I carry sci fi eyes. All right, thanks, everybody. KASELL, Brody, I think you were still speaking, right?\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I'm in. I can just get my comments, then. Um, well.\nSpeaker 0: I. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 8: Sorry. I think three of us now have asked the question of what the actual process would be, and then that doesn't include the the public speakers. Would it be helpful to hear from staff about how people can get community members got engaged?\nSpeaker 0: I didn't want to. Councilmember. Yes, that would be helpful. The council member already was in the middle of a sentence.\nSpeaker 6: So I mean, to the extent that that can be answered, yes, because, um, I'm going to be really brief when I say what I'm going to say. But I if we can answer that question, sure, I'll wait.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All right. Who on staff would like to address the questions that you've heard the.\nSpeaker 5: Audience sell out all the attempt to answer it? Marisa Ashcraft And say council. And so I'm what I will the way I will answer it is if it was a city manager appointed committee, here's how I would visit it.\nSpeaker 5: I'm not trying to compare it to any other type of established committee, but just sort of how how I envision that is that there would be probably 3 to 5 steering committee members. I've it's been somewhat flexible at this point.\nSpeaker 5: And the reason it's somewhat flexible because I wasn't sure what this discussion tonight would produce. So you can't have anything definitive until you have the discussion. So I'd see 3 to 5. I'd see that starting hopefully appointments probably within the week.\nSpeaker 5: And then that would be starting. I as far as people wanting to be involved, I do not see that the committee would have I don't see that the committee would have what I would call designated people representing entities.\nSpeaker 5: I would see that people would represent themselves and that anyone would have that opportunity. And I think when people talked about marginalized individuals or individuals of color or just marginalized individuals in particular, that I want to encourage people to do it.\nSpeaker 5: And that's part of the reason I don't want to have people that represent groups or interest groups, but more people that represent their own views so that you have a natural, more community based approach. So that committee would be appointed and then I would rely on that steering committee to then or subcommittee to then make the decisions\nSpeaker 5: as far as what I call task force. That's my term task force. And there's five or six areas that we're looking at. And then that could be very flexible people, could it? If you don't have it under this committee concept, if you under this committee concept, if people come in mid process, they could still add people mid\nSpeaker 5: process. So if people find out about it through the process, they'd be able to be added. How do people let us know? I actually put my email here on the chat here for those that are still on here, but you email myself or the assistant city manager or the say manager's office.\nSpeaker 5: Any of those three emails or you could contact councilmembers and councilmembers to forward your names to us. Any of those would approach and I I'm trying to have a process to be more inclusive. That's how I would see as more inclusive and including different viewpoints.\nSpeaker 5: I think that's the way you would go. I believe the assistant city manager already laid out sort of the timelines that we're looking at, which have some consistency and probably a little more aggressive than what the Oakland timelines that were set out in the mayor's statement just a few minutes ago when you were talking about what was\nSpeaker 5: on Oakland's agenda. Hopefully that answers some of the questions and I can clarify more.\nSpeaker 0: And in addition to emailing you, can we also put something out on social media, different platforms that we you know, that where we reach people.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. The answer is yes. The question, Eric, I think he had to get up for your light. It was social media was we can we get it out on social media as well and other platforms like that? Yes.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, we can.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Let's see. What. Were there other questions that. Oh. You know, I had one starring in to you, John. Vice Mayor, there were some speakers who and they expressed their concern with how you having. Oh, too much autonomy.\nSpeaker 0: And so what? Tell us what the city manager or city assistant city manager's role in this would be as far as any recommendations, what comes back to the council? Can you give us some information about that?\nSpeaker 5: So this process is is probably a little different than some processes in that people really want a community based process. And so that's where the appointment of the the subcommittee or steering committee, as I call it, would happen.\nSpeaker 5: And then they would be involving other I would be we would be a filter of getting names to them as well as they would also have names, but they would appoint those committees and then they would be looking to collaborate with my office and getting resources.\nSpeaker 5: So if they have questions, if they're trying to get data, there would be a flow and collaboration and support from my office. So that would be how I see it. But the recommendations that were being come in to my office would then be put together in a report and go to the council.\nSpeaker 5: It wouldn't be filtered. It's just that's the way the process. We're trying to have a community based process. At the same time as something that has a city element that brings back a formal recommendation to the city council eventually and so or and reports back to the council.\nSpeaker 5: And so that's how I'm trying to create the process. There were some other questions and I want to just steer to another thing real quick about Brown Act. So a lot of people when I deal with committees, a lot of people don't understand with Brown Act that understand the sunshine ordinance that so for instance if you have\nSpeaker 5: a committee so let's say one of these subcommittees has five or six let's say it has six people. If it has six individuals on it, some people don't realize that if three of those individuals get together, they've actually violated state law under a Brown act, because under Brown act, you have to do noticing if you're going to\nSpeaker 5: get together and talk about a subject. So if they wanted to have an informal discussion, they would have to have to do it. So there's a lot of rules and regs and sometimes people don't understand that. So this would give a little bit more flexibility while also involving the public and also trying to have a formalized process\nSpeaker 5: to get recommendations back to the council. Because ultimately, when you're talking about things like police services and you're talking about budgets, those will be city council decisions eventually between now and the spring of of 2021.\nSpeaker 0: And Tony has had a cancer day. So sorry. You've had your hand up. Sorry.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry. Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: Quick question. How do you envision the task force taking community input? Or is is the task was just going to talk among themselves over whatever subject matter there. What's what's the engagement?\nSpeaker 5: That that's a good question. And I think some of that has to still evolve and some of that has to evolve from how the task force believes it's best to be able to engage the community, or I call it the steering committee or subcommittee.\nSpeaker 5: We've called it three different names. But but the committee or the overall committee, how they get public input, I would want that to somewhat evolve from what they think are the best routes. So I don't have that predetermined at this point, but I don't see it that it would just be from within themselves.\nSpeaker 5: I don't see that as an option. But how they would engage people, whether it be through social media, whether it be through other means, I haven't predetermined that because I think you need to give a certain amount of that.\nSpeaker 5: They need a lot of autonomy. And that would be part of.\nSpeaker 2: The point is that they will and they just happen. Yes, they will. It's just how they do it is the issue. Okay, I get it right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Hey. Did I face me? I was calling on you, but I might have been muted.\nSpeaker 4: I have some comments that I had another couple of questions. I've heard a couple of times that there were people who informed. Who are the people who informed this process? I'm curious.\nSpeaker 0: All the people the same age she's been talking to.\nSpeaker 4: Or the subcommittee talked to you about the subcommittee. You both have mentioned that you've spoke to people who gave you the advice and curious who was.\nSpeaker 0: That.\nSpeaker 4: Will give them the conversation, I think. Okay. Who's informing?\nSpeaker 0: Why do I keep doing that? Okay. So I can.\nSpeaker 8: I can list people. I've talked to a number of people throughout this entire process. Rashid Shabazz, Robbie Wilson. I could you could you could do I could send you every email that everybody sent me about this topic as I've read through those.\nSpeaker 8: John, you had recommended that I talked to Shalom. I talked to Shalom that that also informed it. I think that, you know, I listen to public comment. I mean, I could literally I think probably hundreds of people have kind of informed the process for me.\nSpeaker 8: I haven't had specific conversations about who's going to serve on different committees. My recommendation has been for people to email, and so that's what I've done.\nSpeaker 0: I'll jump in. Most recently last night I had a Zoom meeting. The youth activists of Alameda asked to meet with me via Zoom and and I told them that I hoped they would apply to be on these subcommittees because one of the things I've been doing a lot of reading about what other cities and not just in\nSpeaker 0: the Bay Area but in other states, because this is this is happening around the country, which is a really good thing. But they do talk about the need to have representation of typically underrepresented people and not just somebody who knows someone.\nSpeaker 0: And so one of the two individuals. But I think there's a third I guess I'll throw out the name and they can tell me if I'm wrong that I reached out to because I was so impressed when I heard him on your town hall this there was a gentleman named Al Mance and he's with the public defender's\nSpeaker 0: office, Alameda County, and he was interested in helping guide this process. And he knows Joleen, right, is someone who's in the community and oh, I'm lips. You know what? I guess I've been steering this discussion so much that I'm out of time that I was just informed.\nSpeaker 0: I'll tell you more if you vote me.\nSpeaker 4: So I will move to waive the time.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And you would second that.\nSpeaker 2: Can.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Maybe we have a roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 1: I'm remember they said not. Not. I O.D..\nSpeaker 6: Uh, let's just try to keep it short, though.\nSpeaker 3: I vellum high.\nSpeaker 1: As the.\nSpeaker 0: Ashcroft I and I will. So al-Mansour was interested in then Joline Wright is someone that he he knows and she's that there are parents of school children and they know each other in various ways. She she's an amazing organizer.\nSpeaker 0: And I think she's a she's an operations manager for an architectural firm. And man, she runs circles around me as far as organization and then a name that was mentioned for one of the steering committee people. But again, I have not been involved, so I don't know if they've connected with the city manager, but it was Christine\nSpeaker 0: Chilcott, who is well known as the executive director of Girls Inc of the Island City. And so I think and what when I have gotten emails from people saying I want to be involved, I'm forwarding them off to the city manager saying, you know, put these in in the file.\nSpeaker 0: But I don't you know, I would never want it to just be people who know to email a councilmember. So that's why we want to get the word out far and wide. I would say that I do think that the people who have been following these discussions and attending these meetings and speaking are really natural constituents.\nSpeaker 0: And I take copious notes and there's a number of your names you can always say, know that we'll try to hopefully will be will be contacted. But I I'm just like I said, I'm excited about just doing something that we haven't been done before, but spreading the word far and wide.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Brody, was it who's who? I mean.\nSpeaker 6: I can just go out. I'll just make my comments and then I'll turn it over back. It's really not for me to decide who's who the leaders of the black community are. It's not for me to decide who the voices of the black community are.\nSpeaker 6: I hope that in selecting people that our staff has heard, for example, the four speakers that spoke live, this agenda item and that has spoken to other agenda items and real and recognized that that's going to be a challenge.\nSpeaker 6: Um. I'm going to quote an African-American mayor, and I hope that it's better than the last one I did. I read an article where the London breed was interviewed talking about her Vogue interview, and she goes, I want people to respect the opinions, the feelings of black people, and allow us to decide what is in our best\nSpeaker 6: interest. The black community is capable of speaking for ourselves and deciding what's in our best interests. And she went on to accuse white progressives of projecting beliefs onto African-Americans and stating that many progressive policies historically backed by whites in San Francisco have not worked for the city's black residents.\nSpeaker 6: So what that tells me is if I say, Oh, I would do it this way, or No, I would prefer that, or maybe you should do it that way, or I should be critical of that. Or No, that's not for me to say.\nSpeaker 6: It's not for me to project. It's not for me to say, you know, this policy should work, uh, or, you know, pigeonhole the committee into a certain direction. It's me. Step back and listen and let the community process take its.\nSpeaker 6: Take its place. Because, you know. It doesn't really matter what I think. It's going too fast or too slow. It matters what the people who are most impacted. You know, whether it's going too fast or slow. So I'm not going to be critical of anything until I hear what they have to say.\nSpeaker 6: And then I will use the levers of power that I have to accomplish what they're asking. But in the meantime, I'm going to step aside and not try to project what I think is best for them. And on this community, I want to hear what they have to say.\nSpeaker 6: So that's kind of where I am. And I appreciate the work of the subcommittee, and I hope that the city manager and our staff has listened to these comments that our commenters have been making over the past few weeks about this.\nSpeaker 6: And let's the black community in Alameda tell us who their leaders are and who should represent them and let them decide what's in their best interests. And, you know, not white people.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I just have to say, when you were quoting what London Mayor Breed said, one of the young women last night in the youth activists of Alameda said something very similar. Vice mayor, were you next?\nSpeaker 4: Sure. So I have an issue with this not being a brown act body. And with the exception of the noticing, which I think is not a problem. I don't think the other issues that were were highlighted is why it shouldn't be a Brown act are really that amnesty.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, I think that, you know, a committee can have subcommittees and that subcommittee can meet in without violating the Brown Act with small groups and get input when there are sensitive conversations that need to happen with groups that don't want to come to public meetings, etc..\nSpeaker 4: But I think setting up a process that is supposed to be very public and transparent and bring everybody in, bring the entire community into this conversation. I think setting it up where it's unclear when they're meeting and who's meeting and where the the committee members themselves are meeting as a majority, possibly without notice, because they're just having\nSpeaker 4: conversations and developing answers, I think is kind of problematic for me. I am struggling because on the 29th we heard last week about, you know, we unanimously appointed a subcommittee and gave some direction on what we'd like to have come back.\nSpeaker 4: And what we're supposed to come back with by the 31st was, you know, kind of a subcommittee, some community objectives and goals and a work plan. And we're three little over three weeks past that, and we don't have any of it.\nSpeaker 4: And so I'm going to reflect a little some of what we've heard from the community about the what is going on. We don't seem to be moving forward. And my concern is that we are slowly getting to the place where we're really probably not going to have real recommendations in time to have the budget conversation that we\nSpeaker 4: committed to having in October. I will be really surprised if these subcommittees are really up and running before the end of August because of how long it's going to take. If we're really going to do this, I don't know how we can appoint the steering committee made up of a broad group of community members who don't know\nSpeaker 4: that this steering committee is going to be done in the next week. So I've heard a strong commitment to making sure that we have a have a deep pool who have been pulled in for this conversation. But that's going to take some time.\nSpeaker 4: You know, I think we need to be also clear because I've heard some confusing comments. You know what, we gave direction on and what came back to us tonight is about policing. And not a broad overall conversation about systemic racism in the entire community and everything that falls under that.\nSpeaker 4: And so I think that we are we are having conversations about conversations that need to happen. But I think that we need to be clear as we move forward with what the scope of this is. Personally, I would like to see us give some very specific direction to the city.\nSpeaker 4: I want to be really clear. I have no problem with the city manager making this decision. I have no problem with him empowering a committee of community members to take this and run. This is not about community or not, but I think that, you know, giving some real strong guidelines of expectations is one of the goals that\nSpeaker 4: we have in this in terms of, you know, how we would like. You know, I'm kind of this considered. And I think also, you know, I would like to have some commitments to timelines for when things are going to be done.\nSpeaker 4: And well, you know, there are some check ins that may be happening. They are not we don't know that they're going to happen. And I think some of them are we should talk I don't know with what is this check in in September going to look like if the group is just starting to meet and engage the\nSpeaker 4: community at the end of August and early September. So, you know, I think I don't know how to do it, but I would like a commitment to the to the steering committee. And if the subcommittees are going to be independent groups working on their own, that they you know, I would call it a steering committee and then\nSpeaker 4: have committees and then you can have subcommittees on the subcommittees that can go out and have non Brown Act meetings when when those are needed. But the community will at least know that the committee is not meeting in secret in the old backroom of all these days, you know, with the way the way we used to do\nSpeaker 4: it. So, you know, that's that's kind of where I'm coming from. I honestly feel a little frustrated that after the conversation last week that that we're still kind of trying to figure out how to how to even start moving forward.\nSpeaker 4: It feels like we've kind of gone backwards from the 29th at this point in time to starting all over again. So I guess I'd like to hear their maybe just their maybe majority support to move forward, and that's fine.\nSpeaker 4: But, you know, if we can't make a commitment to having this be an open and transparent process with our actions, I won't be able to support it.\nSpeaker 0: And I just want to call in Councilmember Vela, but I just want to point out that one of these subcommittees is about addressing systemic and community racism and also anti-racism. It's not all about policing, although I'm sure it's tied up in there.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Vela.\nSpeaker 8: And you know, I just want to address a couple of things. There are a lot of resources that go into having publicly agendas, notice meetings. We have to have staff present. We have to agenda is that we have to make sure it's not at a time that conflicts with council or any of our other committees.\nSpeaker 8: They have to then agree to the meeting, date and time, get it posted ahead of time so there is no impromptu. We're going to have able this group can meet next week. We're going to go meet with this group next week.\nSpeaker 8: I don't think the intent here is to not have a transparent process. I think that's been made abundantly clear not only by this council that that's the expectation, but by the community. And I think that if we end up with a process that does not include publicly agendas, meetings, that does not include opportunities for community input, and\nSpeaker 8: where the task force essentially nobody knows what they're doing and nobody knows who they're meeting with. I think this is going to fall apart really quickly. I think it's going to fall apart basically before September. So I want to put that out there.\nSpeaker 8: We always have the ability as a council and frankly, if we wanted to, we could agenda something for September to say, you know, if we if we want to do to say, look, we want to have a very transparent process and we're going to all now start picking people, because I think this goes back to who is\nSpeaker 8: doing the selection and how do we go about doing that and who is making the decisions about who's in the room. And I I'm of the mindset that I do not want to be the one making the giving the direction about this is the goal.\nSpeaker 8: I think I've heard a lot of different things, frankly, from the community, all sorts of different things from from various community members. And I think the whole purpose is to allow them to goal set. And I you know, I would also add that I think and this is something that I've struggled with, is how do we make\nSpeaker 8: this a transparent process, but how do we also allow for and stretch our resources to allow for the most meetings possible and things like that? When I'm looking at other cities and seeing what went into their reform processes in terms of how they got the feedback, it was a process that wasn't confined by or expending resources on\nSpeaker 8: like, you know, 50 different meetings that were all televised and very formal. They went out and they had these informal meetings. And I don't know that there's the same benefit of speaking with a subcommittee of two as there is with actually having these meetings with a full subcommittee.\nSpeaker 8: So I think, you know, and this is something that I struggled with was how do we create this process in wanting a transparent process and warning of a place for people to just to go to to have a voice, is trying to figure out how do we do that with the resources that we have and how do\nSpeaker 8: we expedite it? Because I do think there is an expectation that they will make recommendations before our week before we meet in October. And again, if they don't come back with, hey, here's some short term recommendations that we have, I think it is going to be a problem.\nSpeaker 8: But. But I guess my question to staff is, is there a way for us to get report backs and updates in terms of the progress? So if we don't like it, we can come in and create a formal council led process that's subject to the Brown Act.\nSpeaker 0: And before IT staff. Simpson To answer that, I wanted to also just add on to Councilmember Velez addressing both remarks. Sweat's concerns. I do understand, Vice Mayor, the Brown Act is a very important principle. I don't believe that any of these subcommittees are going to be doing backroom deals that will somehow be to the detriment of the\nSpeaker 0: city. But I understand the principle and why it exists, but I am wondering if and again, I really want to respect the process of hearing from the community and letting them lead. But I think the benefit. So what I will say is maybe there's a hybrid approach, maybe that initially the you know, maybe all the groups get\nSpeaker 0: together, all the applicants, I don't know how they want to do it. And then somehow people must self-select or they I'm sure different individuals have different areas of interest that they have of subcommittees or working groups, whatever they are that they want to serve on.\nSpeaker 0: Perhaps it would work if and again, this is just suggestions to consider that an opportunity for committee members to get to know each other because I'm I'm assuming I'm hoping that people will come together who've never met and and then have that opportunity to to get to know each other, get to feel comfortable talking among each other\nSpeaker 0: , not necessarily in the spotlight. I find when I'm dealing with the youth that sometimes they're amazing, but sometimes some shyness sets in and you might not hear from them. And but then perhaps after some initial meetings of getting together and goal setting and and, you know, figuring out and again, setting their agenda.\nSpeaker 0: But within the the framework that we were wanting to be advised on, then maybe it transitions over to Brown Act. But I just it it is it is just something that I was just trying to respect suggestions I heard from members of the black community.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Brody's got his hand up, please. Thanks.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, I didn't hear when you all made your presentation that this was going to be a process done in secret behind closed doors. And I believe that by the time before anything comes to council, that there's going to be some public vetting of it with the people that are involved.\nSpeaker 6: Otherwise, it's not going to have any legitimacy. Right. I mean, we have the privilege to sit here for seven and a half hours, you know, and we also have the benefit of, you know, in some cases 20 years out of council or being on committees, you know, boards and commissions and understand.\nSpeaker 6: And we also have, you know, a very large and capable staff behind us. We are asking the community members that have none of that. Now was the time. Not the privilege, not the time. Not the staff to be involved in this process.\nSpeaker 6: And there have been a lot of brave people come speak that I am fairly sure. Well, first of all, they hadn't spoken before, right? I mean, there were stories, you know, I heard at some of the marches that, you know, were teary, teary eyed from the people because they'd never spoken those stories before.\nSpeaker 6: So, you know, to have them have to give their name and show their face, you know, at the first time they speak, that it can be overwhelming. And I think we want to get the best input possible. And the most real experience is from our communities of color, you know, experiences that I don't have and I'll never\nSpeaker 6: have. And none of us really will because none of us are black, to be honest with you. So we're never going to know what that's like. So I'm I wish we had some flexibility in the Brown Act, but, you know, to me, the Brown Act is, you know.\nSpeaker 0: Forgive me.\nSpeaker 3: For.\nSpeaker 6: A bunch of it's passed by a bunch of white people, you know. So, you know, why are we going to wish that on our communities of color?\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Brody, I am getting the text from the city clerk that it is 1228. We can do a couple of things. Council. We said we go to 1230. We are meeting again on Saturday. This that will be our prior two setting workshop will be Zoom, but it won't be broadcast.\nSpeaker 0: On the other hand, this was an opportunity to give the city managers suggestions. Perhaps we feel that we have. But quickly, in 2 minutes, tell me what your what your pleasure is. I guess I've heard from Councilman Brody.\nSpeaker 0: I've heard from Councilmember Vela. Councilmember de SAC has his hand up.\nSpeaker 2: You know, I just want to make a quick 22nd comment. And my 22nd comment is simply, you know, I find myself hard pressed to support a process that doesn't actively notice the public and engage the public. So, you know that that would be an important issue.\nSpeaker 0: You want to make sure that that was part of the process?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All right. Any further suggestions before we run out of time? And do you want to come back to this on Saturday or have we given enough suggestions?\nSpeaker 4: You might. Oh.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 5: City manager if for continuing email. Although I.\nSpeaker 0: Regret. I'm not sure we are. I'm not sure. Let me. Let me hear from the council, please. Council.\nSpeaker 4: I you don't. I mean what you guys want is, is a non action so there's no vote to be taken. So I won't call a vote, but I'm not supportive of moving forward in the direction that is proposed.\nSpeaker 0: You would like to see more Brown Act involvement or a total ban?\nSpeaker 4: I don't I don't believe the Brown Act causes half the limits I've heard tonight. So.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Okay. I. And I'm not sure that I think continuing more of a discussion. On Saturday would make a difference. I think maybe we have to see what comes out of this process and we can still refine it further if we don't feel that it's working.\nSpeaker 6: Staffed. Okay with the process, by the way.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilor Rody, and I think two others of us are too. But I understand this is it is a leap of faith. As I said before, we have never done anything like this before. And, you know, you want to proceed carefully.\nSpeaker 0: Did you have any any clarifying questions from staff before we adjourn? I'm going to assume you're unmuted and just have nothing to say. Okay. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 4: Jumping to the next item, are we going to get that guy?\nSpeaker 0: Well, it's 1231, but I don't.\nSpeaker 3: Want to start right now.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All right.\nSpeaker 4: So comment, give, give.\nSpeaker 3: Is that being continued? Is that being.\nSpeaker 8: Continued to Saturday?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Shall we continue that to Saturday?\nSpeaker 4: I just.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. The. Yes, Councilmember. I mean, I'm going to make Mr. Levitt a member of the council. City manager Levitt.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, I, I what I was going to recommend is you may want to think of moving it to different day because Saturday with the agenda for you have in front of you, we're looking at 6 to 6 and a half hours just for the agenda you're looking at.\nSpeaker 5: That's the concern.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: Crime. I'm just concerned. Adding an item like that. Well, we'll extend it further.\nSpeaker 0: It's not a quick item. Okay. We could do one of a couple of things. We could go a little longer tonight, but maybe that's not advisable. And then, as I said, the city clerk mentioned that Thursday is a possibility Thursday evening.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Vela, did you have your hand up or your muted your muted.\nSpeaker 8: I would like to make a motion to continue tonight's meeting until 1240 so that we can make a decision about continuing this other item.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay. Because we're out of time. Okay.\nSpeaker 4: I will. Second, Councilmember Abdullah's motion.\nSpeaker 0: All right. May we ever recover, please? To ever think that.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: Next like.\nSpeaker 4: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Odie.\nSpeaker 4: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Mayor. As the Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Carries by five eyes. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, so who's got the floor?\nSpeaker 8: Matt Amaya It seems like there's two options. One is to continue it to Thursday, the other is to continue it to Saturday. For this, the third option, which is to continue it all the way to September, as my understanding.\nSpeaker 0: Or a city manager. Or am I muted and a city manager?\nSpeaker 5: Or you could continue to a third complete. Like if you wanted to continue to the first week of August or something, no.\nSpeaker 2: One's going anywhere.\nSpeaker 5: You could do that, too. That's a that's a fourth option.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: No meetings next week either.\nSpeaker 6: Next week we talk about this item or the next meeting's item.\nSpeaker 8: The next meeting's item.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thursday doesn't work for me, but I'm happy with any of those.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Um.\nSpeaker 8: I have a conflict on Thursday as well, but.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Um. Well, I mean, we do have a full day Saturday, but we could maybe say on. You're fine with.\nSpeaker 3: Sweat.\nSpeaker 8: I'm fine with either Saturday or finding another day next week. But I do not want to wait until September for this.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, I agree with what his next week look like. So we we could do this. We could ask the city clerk to poll everyone about a date that works for us for next week.\nSpeaker 3: We need you have to we need to.\nSpeaker 0: Continue to a date certain. So. So why don't you pull us now?\nSpeaker 4: How about next Tuesday, which is a Tuesday night that doesn't have a council meeting?\nSpeaker 0: Let me chair.\nSpeaker 6: I could do that. But we've done with the other item, or is that in limbo?\nSpeaker 4: There's no action taken. There's no.\nSpeaker 8: Action.\nSpeaker 6: I thought there was a we were supposed to.\nSpeaker 4: Say, oh, you're not allowed to play action.\nSpeaker 0: We make suggestions.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. It said, accept the report so we don't have to vote to accept the report.\nSpeaker 0: Do we need a vote to accept the report, Mr. Shen?\nSpeaker 4: My recommendation is that you do not.\nSpeaker 6: Take a vote. Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We could do that. Okay. Harris. Tuesday. Excuse me. What were you saying, Councilor Brody?\nSpeaker 6: I said we'll accept The Hague.\nSpeaker 0: Look at that advice. That was easy. So then we're looking at. Can't see my calendar. Tuesday will be the 28th. Okay. Is everybody good with that? What time?\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 0: Phys ed. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Early.\nSpeaker 4: It does.\nSpeaker 0: Do it. Let's do it.\nSpeaker 3: 5:00 o'clock. That works.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 4: And for those listening, it's still no public comment, right?\nSpeaker 0: Because I know public comment was closed last time. It does get opened up by moving to yet another date. Okay. City Manager Levitt. Yes, sir. But you have to unmute. And you're.\nSpeaker 5: Right. I am.\nSpeaker 4: Here you go.\nSpeaker 5: It. This is not a barrier to having on Tuesday, but I have a conflict with another city meeting that I have to be at between 430 and six. So. But that's fine. I don't need to be there for that.\nSpeaker 0: Is that is the assistant city manager available?\nSpeaker 5: I think he could be.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Well, and I don't I mean, I don't know that we need them, but. Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker 4: So yesterday, was that the. Hey, you just threw me under the bus. Look.\nSpeaker 0: The assistant city manager is good with this stuff. They, um. Okay, so I think we are ready to adjourn, so we need a vote. Oh, we need.\nSpeaker 1: A vote.\nSpeaker 0: Because we do. Yes, we do. So do we have a motion to make?\nSpeaker 4: A motion to do this? I Oh, yes. The final item to Tuesday night, next Tuesday, the 28th at 5 a.m., 5 p.m..\nSpeaker 0: Mean. Okay. The vice mayor has made a motion to have a second. Somebody. Come on, guys, we don't have time. The second from Councilmember de SAC. Oh. All right. It's been moved by the vice mayor, seconded by councilmember deaths.\nSpeaker 0: Any discussion? Seeing that we have a roll call vote with.\nSpeaker 1: Councilors based on. Yes. Next site.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 1: Odie.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 1: Vela. I may as the Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Carries by five eyes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So we will see you all. A week from today. Well, the week from yesterday.\nSpeaker 3: Saturday.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, yeah, Saturday. We'll see. See everybody on Saturday. All right. Um, I think we're at the end of the meeting, right?\nSpeaker 3: Little over time.\nSpeaker 1: All right. We're under 40.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, just.\nSpeaker 0: It's not quite, but. Yeah, but we voted to extend. Okay, so as I noted in the beginning, we will adjourn this meeting in memory of Congressman John Lewis. All right, everyone, thank you for your good work tonight.

We're going to go to move to item 32, please.\nSpeaker 0: Item 32 is a report from Public Works Recommendation Received File a presentation on the citywide temporary parklet program and request direction from City Council. Citywide.\nSpeaker 7: Turn this over to city staff.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mayor and Council. So I will turn it over to our team in public works. We prepared the report. This came to us from a council member and approved by the entire council to be back here tonight to talk through the options on Parklets as well as our Open Open Streets programs, which includes private business as\nSpeaker 6: well and their parking lots. We've got a short presentation for you with some recommendations. I will say we really are looking for council direction tonight. We've provided some framework, but all of this can be changed. You can move up the deadlines, you move back the deadlines.\nSpeaker 6: This really is kind of the policy. And we try to provide some general ideas for you to work from and make some adjustments as you go. So I will turn it over now to Carl Hickman, our traffic engineer, and Nico McCauley and Marconi and our deputy director.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council, thank you for this opportunity to make a presentation tonight. As you are aware, about two years ago, the City Council approved an Open Streets initiative that allowed for the installation of temporary parklets to assist certain businesses such as restaurants in continuing their operations.\nSpeaker 2: While indoor dining was restricted at the time. Indoor dining was then brought back, but in a limited capacity. The council extended the life of the temporary program and it is currently scheduled to sunset at the end of this month in June.\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to introduce Carl Hickman, City Traffic Engineer, who's going to give a presentation explaining where we've been, where we are, and where we recommend going. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Diego. Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members. We're going to go ahead and get right into it here. As Deckard mentioned, the original intent, as you may recall, was to install Parklets temporary parklets in response to COVID 19 to help businesses to support businesses in their efforts.\nSpeaker 8: It was a citywide effort to support the economic recovery for businesses and health order and physical distancing requirements. The first temporary parklets were installed in May of 2020 at the program's peak. There were 112 temporary parklet locations citywide.\nSpeaker 8: There were 124 participating businesses. What that means is that in some cases, businesses shared parklets. There were 176 outdoor activity permits or EPS, as we refer to them, and there were ten sidewalk dining permits. Currently, there are 80 temporary parklet locations.\nSpeaker 8: Citywide 91 participating businesses. Again, some timesharing parklets 12 parklets have been removed since January of 22 alone. There are currently 27 outdoor activity permits and there are nine sidewalk dining permits. That's where we stand currently. The picture there you can see one of our PSB members refilling the parklets the corrals with water.\nSpeaker 8: Currently we're going to we're going to look at the number of temporary parklets. Per council district. You can see at the height of the program there were 112 on the far left column there, again helping 124 businesses. We have since removed 32 parklets overall.\nSpeaker 8: Currently we have 80 assisting 91 businesses again and you can kind of see the breakdown for each council district. CD1 has 17, currently CD2 23, CD3 34, etc. on down the list. I'll leave that for a couple of seconds there.\nSpeaker 8: Now regarding BP's broken down again by district. Originally, there were 176, and now we have a total of only 27. Once again, CD one for CD two has one, T three has 11, etc. on down the list. Currently there are 27.\nSpeaker 8: The one in the picture there is the Reno Room 3400 block of East Broadway, and you can see how it is installed really in the parking area. It's not in the public area. The plan is right now that the ops will sunset on June 30th of this year, regardless of the outcome of the temporary parklet discussion that\nSpeaker 8: we're having this evening. Now because Belmont Shore has so many temporary Parklets I wanted to take a minute to kind of focus on what's going on there. And the really the focus is on Second Street between Livingston and Bayshore.\nSpeaker 8: Currently, there are 23 temporary parklet locations helping 28 participating businesses. Ten temporary parklets have been removed to date. And regarding parking in that entire stretch of roadway, there are 517 parking stalls available, 351 are on street, 166 are on the public lots nearby on the adjacent streets.\nSpeaker 8: And right now, we have 52 parking stalls that have been converted to temporary parklets. Basically, that boils down to approximately 10% of the parking is now dedicated to temporary parklets. 6% on Second Street and 4% on the side streets.\nSpeaker 8: Now when we talk about temporary park, that's from engineering point of view. We do have many elements that we have to consider. And really, a lot of this has to do with safety. First of all, we have to have an object marker on the corner.\nSpeaker 8: There you see that white and black sign. It's sort of like an arrow that helps keep drivers away from the park. But we want to make sure we have a 12 foot travel way on the outside of the park, that minimum for a driver about driving vehicular lane.\nSpeaker 8: There are many structural elements within the Parklet that have to be strong enough to absorb impact from a vehicle. That's why we have the water filled corrals within the parklets. There are many concerns regarding the stormwater drainage, safe pedestrian passage.\nSpeaker 8: Utility conflicts. We are really concerned about putting parklets on top of gas lines, waterlines, electrical vaults, sewer manholes, just to name a few. And we are concerned about parking impacts and accessibility. And I wanted to point out that existing temporary parklets cannot convert automatically to a permanent status.\nSpeaker 8: Now maintaining the integrity of temporary Parklets we've been dealing with this now for about 25 months. The staff and transportation and mobility, we try to address every situation on a case by case basis. There is no one size fix for any of these parklets.\nSpeaker 8: We remove Parklets by request of business owners when they decide that, you know, they don't want to to to have it out in front of their business anymore. We're constantly having to reduce or adjust the part that footprints.\nSpeaker 8: What we've found is that businesses are slowly but surely trying to slowly expand their parklet space. So we're trying constantly to adjust that. We need to reaffirm that consent from businesses neighboring a temporary parklet because of frontage overlap.\nSpeaker 8: What that means is, is that parklets are meant to be installed in the front and the frontage of that the business that has the permit. And in many cases it can expand in front of the nearby business only with the approval from that nearby business.\nSpeaker 8: And we've been working hard to maintain maintain insurance compliance, and we also do many inspections. City staff, we go out regularly to inspect what's going on with the parklets. Now, we've had a lot of outreach regarding the PARKLET program.\nSpeaker 8: We have had virtual meetings, public and business surveys. We've coordinated regularly with the council districts. We do field inspections and business visits, as I mentioned. We receive emails, phone calls, daily. People concerned are asking questions. And we regularly, you know, recommend that residents go to certain websites if they have a complaint to go to L.B..\nSpeaker 8: L.B. must I'm sorry, go active. Long Beach. There's a survey there on the upper right side of the slide there. You can't quite see it. But that's a that's a checklist that we have and I'm sorry, not a survey, a checklist where when we go out, we want to make sure we're checking the drainage, the signage, whether\nSpeaker 8: we have accessibility, which is the platform firm. Are there structural elements in place? That's the example of the the checklist that we have. And then there's a small card there that we use to advertise the survey that we did last year in November.\nSpeaker 8: That was for folks in CD3. And we'll get to some of those results in a second here on Belmont Shore. Here are some of the results. We have 584 total responses from CD3. These were responses from businesses, residents, customers.\nSpeaker 8: 12 of the responses were from business owners themselves. Of those 584 comments, 38% supported the program 11 support, but with some sort of restriction. 12% were concerned about parking. 6% traffic sight line. 14 Congestion and parking. 9% were concerned about accessibility and esthetic concerns.\nSpeaker 8: Again, on the right there, there's some of the redundant list there of what the concerns were parking impacts, sidewalk access, esthetics, sightlines noise, quality of life issues. So we did get some positive feedback from the surveys. Many value the outdoor dining option that was available, and many people thought that, you know, the parklets improve the walkability of\nSpeaker 8: the area or made it feel more friendly, pedestrian friendly. There was an enhanced experience or character of Belmont Shore that was felt as well. Those were some of the results that we got and there was a website for part of the results.\nSpeaker 8: Now when we talk about permanent parklets again, I want to stress existing temporary parklets are not approved or designed to be permanent. Temporary parklets are managed and permitted separately from the Permanent Parklet program, which predates COVID 19. We do have a sidewalk dining and Parklet handbook that was finalized in 2018.\nSpeaker 8: Permanent Parklet permits have been available through the city's existing Sidewalk Dining and Parks handbook. Permanent. I'm sorry. Permit requires design and construction of new new structures that meet permit requirements. And there can be local coastal zone requirements that apply as well.\nSpeaker 8: The current status of permanent parklet applications right now, only for businesses with a temporary parklet have established a permanent parklet through the formal process and guidelines that I showed to earn CD1 one in CD two and one in CD five.\nSpeaker 8: There are four businesses that have applied for a permanent parklet permit that are currently in the review process three in CD, one and one in CD. 730 Businesses have expressed only interest in the formal establishment of a permanent Parklet seven in CD two and 23 in CD3.\nSpeaker 8: And what this means is that they've come down and they've talked to our permit technicians, or they've made a phone call or sent in an email just asking for information they have not done or started any of the formal process, only expressed interest.\nSpeaker 8: No permanent parklets will not be allowed for the following reasons. There are some cases where we have temporary parklets with businesses, and right now they're not complying with the rules of the game right now. So if they're not complying with the safety requirements, insurance requirements or the refill of the crowd requirements, we want to discourage them from\nSpeaker 8: applying for a permanent parklet if they're not going to follow the rules. If a if an applicant has a business condition that has safety concerns or documented issues that have been determined by the city traffic engineer to be detrimental to the quality of life of nearby businesses and or residents.\nSpeaker 8: That's going to be an issue as well. Number three, all businesses located in the coastal zone will be required to obtain a local Coastal Commission approval. This is an internal city process. The picture there is a shot from Fourth Street.\nSpeaker 8: Now when we talk about permanent parklets, this is a really good example of a permanent parklet. On fourth, it is on the main street, not on a side street, and there's a good drawing there that comes out of the guidelines.\nSpeaker 8: Again, it kind of explains a general idea of what a permanent parklet should look like on a main street. Next, an idea for a permanent parklet on a side street again. There is a drawing for this in the permanent parklet guidelines.\nSpeaker 8: And this location is at the Socialist on fourth where they actually have the permanent parklet or a permanent design on the side street. Now the Open Streets Initiative, we do have recommendations. The first option is that current Open Streets Initiative and temporary parklet program sunsets June 30th, 2022.\nSpeaker 8: The second option is a current Open Streets initiative and temporary parklet program Sunsets on June 30th, 2022, with the exception that any business that has applied for a permanent parklet by August 1st shall be allowed to continue utilizing their temporary parklet until September 30th of 22.\nSpeaker 8: Now, if we decided to go with option number two, we do have a couple of conditions. First, a business must formally apply for a permanent parklet permit per the existing city permanent PARKLET Program no later than August 1st, 2022.\nSpeaker 8: Now, when a business comes in, they will be notified at the time of the application that the proposed permanent parklet may not be feasible because of safety or quality of life concerns. We don't want businesses going through the trouble of getting their plans, talking to engineers, etc., paying the fees when really we're not going to allow that\nSpeaker 8: part of it to happen anyway. For those reasons stated, if the application is accepted, the business must adhere to all temporary parklet permit conditions as the formal approval of the permanent parklet is determined. This includes review of criminal activity and neighborhood quality of life concerns.\nSpeaker 8: Third, the business must comply with all safety insurance and creel refill requirements that is of their temporary parklets. Parks will be removed starting June 30th 22 if businesses fail to comply. Lastly, temporary parking that's allowed on minor side streets after June 30th, 2022.\nSpeaker 8: Only after a case by case review by the city traffic engineer. So that is the extent of the presentation will be welcome to answer any questions you might have.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you very much, Mayor, and members of the Council. So we're available to answer questions. I do want to point out that was a lot of information. We focused a lot on Parklets. We're also looking for direction tonight on the apps.\nSpeaker 6: Right now, the council direction is that those end on June 30th. If you want to take any other action on that, we want to hear that. And again, all these dates can be discussed. The August 1st date was really designed to be people who are going to do a permanent parklet.\nSpeaker 6: We would then work with them and they'd be able to stay open a little bit longer. But the ones that are either not technically feasible or not, we would basically let them know quickly and then those parklets would need to go away.\nSpeaker 6: They would not get an extension through September 30th. So with that, we are available to answer questions and get direction from the council.\nSpeaker 7: Good Councilwoman that change, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you very much. I know there are a lot of members of the public here who have comments, and I want to hear from all of those. But before we start, I want to just ask a couple of questions so that we all have the same framework that might help inform some public comment.\nSpeaker 4: First of all, can you a mr. Heckman, can you put slide number 14 back up? Because I'm going to have a couple of questions about that and why you're doing that. Mr. Heckman, during your presentation, one of the first comments you made was The Peace Will Sunset, regardless of what we do tonight.\nSpeaker 4: But then I heard the city manager say he's looking for some direction on apes. Can I get a little bit of clarification on that?\nSpeaker 6: So I'll clarify. So regardless of what you do, if you do nothing tonight, the parklets technically go away on June 30th, as do the OLP. So that was the decision this council made back in December is to only provide a certain amount of extension to to really work to remove other parklets and have this all end June\nSpeaker 6: 30th because of the item that we got last night last month. We're here tonight to give you a presentation. So I'm just reminding everybody that I think there's been a lot of focus on the parklets and everyone knows about those.\nSpeaker 6: I think a lot of businesses have not been paying attention that their app goes away in two weeks. So if that's the will, the council will implement that if if there is a desire to have that part be extended.\nSpeaker 6: I really would like direction tonight so that we don't have miscommunication with businesses.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So I'll probably address OJP specifically after I hear from everyone because I want to hear the comments, but I know I have some recommendations on apps. The second thing I wanted to ask about is looking at. Well, let me let me back up here.\nSpeaker 4: When we implemented the Open Streets Initiative. We did not, in my opinion, communicate. To the residents, the process that would be required for them to lodge concerns about a particular parklet operation to petition its removal or modification. And there is a process.\nSpeaker 4: So I've learned through talking with the city attorney that there is a process involved. And I'm wondering if someone from the city attorney's office can talk a little bit about is is there a process? What is that process?\nSpeaker 4: And I know personally that we're involved in some of those discussions, but I don't know that we've readily shared the process. And if if staff will remember the last time this item came to council, I specifically asked as part of the extension that there be a process outlined that residents could have an opportunity to lodge objections to\nSpeaker 4: a particular operation.\nSpeaker 2: So to answer your question, the Council on Women Prices we had during the pandemic, we had the venue task force and so that venue task force to go out and seek enforcement of the emergency health order. In addition, they would go out and monitor some of the parklets that were out when they're out and visiting businesses.\nSpeaker 2: And so as part of that task force, we would receive complaints. And as a result of those complaints, we would contact businesses that had parklets. If there was an issue, we would communicate with the business owners. Some of them were cited in the past and usually the citations would handle whatever activity was occurring or whatever the problem\nSpeaker 2: was in relation to the PARKLET as far as removal of the PARKLET. There's only been one that's been removed and that was involving restoration and that involved violations related to the health order. And we did removed out, but we noticed the business of the decision to remove the parklet.\nSpeaker 2: They were provided with 72 hours notice that it would be removed and they were also provided with an opportunity to have an administrative hearing. If they were if they wanted to appeal that decision to remove it, which they did.\nSpeaker 2: And we had the appeal and the appeal was denied in the park that was removed. So that's kind of the process that we had. If there's something else or would you have another question specific to any other area?\nSpeaker 2: I can't answer that as well.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I will, but I'll have to save it to later. So I don't want to run out of time. But in looking at option number two on slide number 14. So first of all, our permanent parklet application process is lengthy.\nSpeaker 4: And one of the things that I talked to the city manager about is if we're going to meaningfully allow people to apply for permanent parklets, we need that and give them this timeline of August 1st. We need that turnaround to be faster.\nSpeaker 4: And if we only have a select architects that they can choose from, they can't pick their own architect and they have to go through the city process and wait for city staff to be able to review things. And how can we ensure that we're able to meet these timelines?\nSpeaker 8: I think that's a legitimate question, Councilwoman. And, you know, it will take time for businesses to contact an engineer or a architect to design these permanent structures. You know, we will be telling businesses right upfront if they're not going to be eligible for this program at all because of safety reasons.\nSpeaker 8: But, yes, you are correct that they will have to quickly, you know, figure out what they want to do, make contact. And we're going to have to expedite our review of these permanent parklet permits as they come in with the designs to make those turnarounds and formal approvals happen.\nSpeaker 8: If you need to change the dates again, we're looking for council's direction. If we need to give them more time.\nSpeaker 6: And I will point out that none of this is really new. They business is really new. Back in December of 2021 that this was going away in June of 30 of 2022. So council was pretty specific that that was the time.\nSpeaker 6: The reason that we're just doing this now is if somebody is almost done and they've done their work and all they need to do is submit it. You know, that's kind of what we're looking for. We don't think someone who has who has waited all this time and is just today starting is going to qualify.\nSpeaker 6: And that is kind of a business decision that they had to make.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. I'm going to my time is up, so I'm going to queue back up. Before we go to public comments, there's a couple other foundational questions I want to ask Councilman Allen.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. It's okay, Mira. I'd like to wait until I hear from the public before my comments.\nSpeaker 7: Councilman. Sorry. Did you want to go now? First the public.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I just have a really quick question because I'm trying to understand option two does. What about I mean, I don't think opioids are going to be able to apply for anything permanent. So would they have a different option to be able to extend out a few more months out?\nSpeaker 4: Because I do have one in my district.\nSpeaker 6: Yes. So Opie's right now in the staff recommendation, it's it is that they would end June 30th. We would be looking for a motion from you to help provide us just with a time of how long you would want piece to be extended to.\nSpeaker 6: And who would it cover? Would it be the ones that are on private property? Would it be the ones that are on public property? Is it none of them. And we can help. You know, the one that you're talking about, for example, Councilmember is on would be on private property.\nSpeaker 6: So. And those are going to be very hard to apply for permanently because you'd have to change the underlying zoning in order to apply for that where a parklet there is an established process picking a park, but there really is not an established process to to do what many of them are doing currently.\nSpeaker 4: Could I didn't do a motion to extend the lapse to September 30th of 2022. They're on private property just so that they have some time. If they have stuff on there too, knowing that it they can't make it permanent.\nSpeaker 6: That could be a motion. And then we would want to get some input on public versus private as well.\nSpeaker 4: And I would accept that as a friendly. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: And that was for all EPS or public or private.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I think that her motion was for the the privates. I would be okay extending it for public. But I want to hear from the public. There is one particular PE in the third district that needs to be modified because it is.\nSpeaker 4: Abutting a neighboring business and needs that the footprint needs to be modified. But if they want to apply for permanent OHIP. Is that even an option now? Oh, no. So there's no option for permanent OHIP. At all.\nSpeaker 2: That's correct. There's no option currently for dedication of a permanent o.p.\nSpeaker 6: You'd have to change zoning.\nSpeaker 2: There's a lot of different changes you would have to change.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Well, that's a good clarification question. Okay. So for this so going. Oh, I'm sorry, Councilwoman Sarah, it's still your. Oh, yeah. No, I'm done. That was it. I just wanted to offer that motion. Sorry.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Back to you, Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Okay, so. So regarding this process being streamlined, streamlined. So we have commitment from city staff that you will expedite your process if there are applications.\nSpeaker 8: That is correct.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Looking here, you mentioned this language of they will be notified that they it may not be feasible because of safety or quality of life concerns. At what point will they. It's one thing to say to someone it may not be feasible.\nSpeaker 4: Go through the application process anyway and keep your parklet open. It's another to say we have determined, based on what we already know, this location is not feasible. Therefore you need to shut the parklet down now. What? What is the answer?\nSpeaker 8: There will be cases where we know a certain parklet is maybe not being a good neighbor where they may be impacting the quality of life of the nearby residents. And in those cases, there is wording in a let me get the right number here in the municipal code that gives the city traffic engineer and the city engineer\nSpeaker 8: a little bit of authority to basically shut that parklet down or not allow a permanent parklet. So some of that authority is there. You know, it doesn't have to be a safety item. It doesn't have to be something that is that is quantitative.\nSpeaker 8: It can be just where we have lots of complaints, where the complaints are documented, where we know there are problems. Again, these are quality of life issues that definitely impact the safety of the area.\nSpeaker 6: And if I'm hearing you correctly, Councilmember, I think you want us to be a little more definitive and not, you know, maybe this, maybe that. So. I totally agree with that. I think we just need to make a decision.\nSpeaker 6: We've got two years of data here. And I think if it's that one is lots of complaints is not going to be feasible. We need to just give them the answer that it is not feasible. There may be somewhere with a one foot change in your boundary you could become feasible.\nSpeaker 6: I think that is in a different category.\nSpeaker 4: And if I may. Councilmember Price. Yes. Is Aaron with the city attorney's office. We are in a unique scenario here because we've had temporary parklets operating for almost for over two years where we have a parklet, a permanent parklet program that exists exists under our municipal code.\nSpeaker 4: And so specifically, what our traffic engineer is referring to is there's a section in 14.1 5.0 30b that specifically gives the opportunity and requires that to the satisfaction of the director of public works.\nSpeaker 3: Before a.\nSpeaker 4: Permit, a permanent parklet permit can be issued. There has to be written consent from the applicable community organizations and building associations, providing evidence of the organization's approval or lack of objection to a Park Parklet installation. So that's the process by which those quality of life considerations come forward in the permanent parklet process.\nSpeaker 4: Okay, good. And I wanted to talk about that because we referenced community organizations, but that is as a very broad definition. A community organization can be a group of neighbors on a street who call themselves the Blanc residents because their community, you know, engaged in community activities as a block in Belmont Shores.\nSpeaker 4: Specifically, there is a business association. There's two residents associations. There's no highways, but there's community organizations. So I just want to make sure that that process involves feedback from not a particular organization per se, but whether it's neighbors, community members, business association, that that feedback is obtained.\nSpeaker 4: Absolutely. And specifically, that section of the municipal code says that it's to the satisfaction of the director of public works, which gives that ability to to ensure that the appropriate folks are having the opportunity to chime in in the process.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. And what about an appeals process? So I imagine that business owners have a right to appeal or do they have a right to appeal? Well, there's a vested right. There's been the extension of of an appeal or due process.\nSpeaker 4: Right. So, for example, for folks that are engaged in our temporary PARKLET program, our temporary PARKLET permit includes an an appeal. Right. And that was something that Deputy City Attorney Art Sanchez explained in relation to the restoration parklet removal in our code section under this permanent parklet program.\nSpeaker 4: That right right to vests when the parklet right vests. And that's covered in section. Sorry. 1/2. 14.1 5.110. And that's when you have a. Parklet permit that has been extended and you're going to have some significant change or revocation of that permit, and that's where the appeal arises.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So the right requires both due process of documenting the allegations, following through a certain process, and then the right of appeal. In relation to the permanent Parklet program? That's correct. In relation to sorry, in relation to the temporary PARKLET program?\nSpeaker 4: That's correct. In relation to the appeal rights under the Long Beach Municipal Code for the Permanent Parklet program. There needs to be that vested right in the permit. It's in the Parklet itself. Got it. Okay. All right. I think I have enough questions right now that I've asked that might help answer some of the questions, but would\nSpeaker 4: if it's OC. Vice Mayor, I'm sorry, the mayor's back to go to public comment.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, we're going to go go to public comment. We do have a significant number of folks who have signed up for public comment. So it's more than than the ten threshold. So that'll go that will be the 92nd clock automatically for the council rules.\nSpeaker 7: So if you want to go ahead and read the first set of five folks and then we'll just go through the public comment. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Will the following speakers please line up at the podium? Heather Carlile. Mark Carlisle. Bill Sheehan. Rita Santos. Oceana and Kelly MacLean.\nSpeaker 3: Hello. I'm Heather Carlisle. I'm the owner of the Belmont Shore Children's Center, located at Terminal Avenue in Olympic Plaza. The park put in front of my business was put there without my consent. There has been a gross lack of enforcement of violations.\nSpeaker 3: The Iconix IP structure be shown in the packet that I have submitted to you in advance of this meeting is it is within six feet of our our classrooms and playground structure. B is harmful to our children, disrupting their peaceful environment and interfering with their ability to learn that children hear inappropriate music with vulgar lyrics daily.\nSpeaker 3: Per the Long Beach Noise Ordinance, our schools designated a quiet zone, locating lively group fitness activities with loud booming music and shouting and structured instructors adjacent to children's classrooms should never have been allowed and should stop immediately. I respectfully ask our District three Councilmember Susie Price to make a motion to amend the ICONIX or IP so as\nSpeaker 3: to remove structure b. I ask the other council members to support this vital request. The removal structure be is fair to both the gym and the preschool. The gym has a plethora of outdoor space and structure, a Olympic Plaza Park and the gym's 4000 square foot roof.\nSpeaker 3: Rooftop. Please protect our children and remove the iconic structure. Be away from our classrooms. Thank you for your consideration.\nSpeaker 2: Council members. Mary Garcia, this is Marc Carlile, and my family owns the Belmont Shore Children's Center that my wife was just talking about, located on the corner of Olympic Plaza and terminal in Belmont Shore. May just be straight to it here.\nSpeaker 2: I'm here to request that our District three Councilmember Susie Price make a motion to amend the Iconix Fitness OPIS on Olympic Plaza so as to close and remove the ap parklet structure that is positioned between the property lines of the Belmont Shore Children's Center and to return that space to the original state and purpose.\nSpeaker 2: Please note that I am not asking you to deny the extension if you so decide to do so of the Iiconics Fitness App beyond the current expiration date of June 30th, 2022, but instead to amend it so that it protects the rights, health and safety of the children at the Belmont Shore Children's Center, as well as the\nSpeaker 2: members of Iconix Fitness. Under an amended Iconix, fitness would still be granted the structure that currently occupies 175 square feet, 175 feet of Olympic Plaza between their property lines, as well as the continued use of the entire Olympic Plaza Park itself.\nSpeaker 2: In addition, iconic fitness has 4169 square feet of outdoor space available on its rooftop. The only thing that would change would be the removal of the structure in front of our property that has become brutally inappropriate and is without our consideration.\nSpeaker 0: Your time has expired.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. My name is Bill Sheehan. I'm a Long Beach resident. I am opposed to granting another extension for the Belmont Shore. Temporary Parklets on safety grounds. Have any of you ever driven north on Pomona or Laverne Avenue and tried to make a right turn onto Second Street?\nSpeaker 2: A sizable portion of the site line looking west is blocked by Parklets. And what I took away from Mister Hickman was that some of these parklets will be rejected because of safety reasons. So my question is, are there currently unsafe parklets that we know about out there and why haven't they been removed?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, the parklets have helped the restaurant survive COVID, but indoor dining is back and so should the repeated sightlines that would allow drivers to drive more safely in the Second Street area. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening to all. My name is Rita Santos Toyama, and I am a resident of District three. Please appreciate that a one size fits all approach to Parklets is not effective. The overreaches and abuses seen by bars and restaurants in Belmont Shaw are unlike any anything you've seen or likely to see in your own districts outside the\nSpeaker 3: third 45 of the 93 total parklets are in District three. Some 30 of them on Second Street and the pier. The bulk of those expressing interest in permanent structures are in the same area. Four of you have zero parklets in your district and have likely not experienced the hazards an affront to quality of life that residents of\nSpeaker 3: Belmont Shaw feel and smell every day. Others have half the number of parklets in the third. The third district does. Please understand and respect that the unique landscape and density of our neighborhood is not at all safe and conducive to ongoing assault of community standards.\nSpeaker 3: The lack of oversight in the two year old temporary parklets point to a grim future for permanent ones in the Shaw. Please sunset the temporary program on June 30th and the overreach protect our Valley community. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Kelly Macklin Well, the next five speakers will line up Ryan Hoover, Melinda Cotton, Jeff Miller, Jenny Holbrook and Brian Cochrane. Thank you. Please begin.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. Mayor Gracey and City Council members. My name is Kelly MacLean. I work alongside the executive director of the Long Beach Restaurant Association and I am speaking on their behalf. I am also a Long Beach resident in District one.\nSpeaker 4: The LBA is an.\nSpeaker 3: Enthusiastic supporter of extending the PARKLET program and believes the program should become permanent. The PARKLET program has allowed for the survival of Long Beach restaurants during the pandemic and are still in high demand from both customers and employees who continue to take COVID precautions.\nSpeaker 3: The Attleboro also request that the Council consider streamlining the permit process for permanent parklets. The current process is cumbersome and too expensive for many small businesses. Please extend the PARKLET program. The Long Beach Restaurant Association would love to work with the Council on the best parklet process and planning moving forward.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Mayor Garcia, an honorable council member, is my name is Ryan Hoover. I'm a fourth generation language native and founding member of the Long Beach Restaurant Association. I come to unite, to voice my concerns to all of you about the premature end to the temporary parklet program.\nSpeaker 2: I believe I have a unique perspective with this as I'm an owner on the second street of Katy Branigan's, as well as a resident in the third district in Naples. Pardon me for once. The open street. That was a godsend when you guys opened it.\nSpeaker 2: It allowed us to open under certain conditions that were unfeasible for business. It allowed owners to be that were saddled with debt to take and had taken out loans to pay for the parklets. And it also allowed businesses to stay open while playing their employees with Governor Newsom.\nSpeaker 2: State of emergency and still active COVID 19 cases on the rise in L.A. County stating that we could be heading for mask mandates again. I think it's a little early to close this program's door. I emphatically ask that you extend the program to a later deadline in order to allow time for further COVID policies to unfold, to\nSpeaker 2: give more time to the city and staff to facilitate a permanent parklet program that could be implemented in a timely manner, as well as give them time to set up and develop the infrastructure to accelerate a process from start to end with internal and external entities that are involved in the permitting process.\nSpeaker 2: I have personally gone through this already and Coastal Commission and the permitting process are not cohesive at all.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Jenny Holbrook, Long Beach resident. Mayor Garcia and council members. I'm asking you to terminate the temporary parklets.\nSpeaker 2: As of June 30th. This was your.\nSpeaker 3: December decision, and I see no.\nSpeaker 2: Reason why you should change your.\nSpeaker 3: Mind today. The businesses have had months to apply.\nSpeaker 2: For and build permanent parklets through.\nSpeaker 3: The established process.\nSpeaker 2: As was outlined by Mr. Modica.\nSpeaker 3: Parklet on Second Street in Belmont Shore or the Parklets at the pier do not make sense for many.\nSpeaker 2: Reasons, including.\nSpeaker 3: Negative impacts to parking, traffic flow, esthetics and noise. But most importantly is the negative impact they.\nSpeaker 2: Have had on access.\nSpeaker 3: For the disability community. The reach required five feet of clear pedestrian.\nSpeaker 2: Access on sidewalks is not.\nSpeaker 3: Maintained by many of the PARKLET operators and this requirement has.\nSpeaker 2: Not been enforced by public works either.\nSpeaker 3: The Long Beach Citizens Advisory Commission on Disabilities has outlined these concerns in detail in a.\nSpeaker 2: Memo that all of you received and also Mr. Modica received, and that was stated on five 1222. Please read it. Please do not extend.\nSpeaker 3: A temporary parklets.\nSpeaker 2: Beyond June 30th. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Mayor and council members. My name is Melinda Cotton and I live in Belmont Shore. We were told when the temporary Parklet program was designed to help restaurants survive COVID 19 restrictions. But somehow the iconic private gym and fitness business was allowed.\nSpeaker 3: In the summer of 2020 to take over half of a two way street to Olympic Plaza Drive near the Belmont Pier, closing one lane of traffic and taking over some 20 free public parking spaces near the beach. Iconix was given a special advance permit at OJP and the Public Works Department installed Orange K rails or barricades down\nSpeaker 3: the middle of the public street. Iconix then installed tall chain link fencing around this barricaded street and parking spaces, filling it with gym equipment and a storage container. For the past two years, only Iconix paid members and staff have been allowed this former public space.\nSpeaker 3: There are no longer any restrictions on Iconix, but it still has possession of this space. The takeover of Olympic Plaza Drive is unnecessary and unconscionable. The city should remove those barricades and return this public street and public parking spaces for coastal visitors and the families and children trying to escape inland summer heat.\nSpeaker 3: It was an inexpensive day at the beach and.\nSpeaker 0: Your time has expired. Jeff Miller and brian cochran.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, mayor. And members of the council and the residents of belmont shore. 100 more than 100 of them who are not able to be here tonight, but signed a petition asking that the parklets be terminated. I live in Belmont Shore, half a block from Second Street.\nSpeaker 2: My comments are concerning only the Belmont Shore Parklets. Belmont Shore has had the reputation of a great neighborhood. It's a nice place to live, to visit, to shop, to dine, to take visitors. Don't we all want to preserve that image?\nSpeaker 2: Isn't that important for the image of Belmont Shore? This image has been hurt by the parklets, and there's a danger of that becoming permanent. The substantial loss of parking has been mentioned. It's now a danger to vehicles pedestrians at intersections because of the lack of visibility.\nSpeaker 2: The walkability of the neighborhood has been lost. There are sidewalk obstructions. It's impossible to stroll leisurely and converse. The sidewalks are filled with dining tables, signage, servers, patrons waiting. The appearance is terrible. So to keep parklets or not, they should be decided by neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 2: And they may be okay in some neighborhoods, but they're not appropriate in Belmont. Sure, it would be a decision only to profit.\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. Your time has expired. Well, the following five speakers please line up. Julie Dean, Rita see Estella to door. Geoffrey Mozart. Dimitrios So if you can line up at the podium, please.\nSpeaker 2: Are and council members. How was your day? How was your morning? Pleasant, I hope. Mine started with five trucks and half a dozen workmen doing loud construction at Belmont Brewing Company, 100 feet from the bedrooms and living spaces of some 140 residents in my condo complex.\nSpeaker 2: My morning included someone who drove in their car through a public walkway to the foot of the nearby pier and decided to blast their music for 30 minutes. It included another 2 hours of those workmen sawing, drilling, hammering and dropping heavy items on the walkway meant for pedestrians, bicyclists and runners.\nSpeaker 2: Had there been an emergency, no fire truck or ambulance could have gotten through. My month has included illegally parked motorcyclists throwing debris at my window, spurred on by the owner of an adjacent catering business operating within OCP, who routinely parks his vehicles in the public walkway.\nSpeaker 2: It also included the same owner at 10 p.m. on a weekend, interrupting his noisy, unloading supplies on the public walkway to stand under my balcony and ask if I was watching porn on my phone because I was documenting his violations for the police.\nSpeaker 2: He asked in front of dozens of my neighbors if I was a pedophile. Owners and managers of these businesses haven't just encroached on public space. They've treated it as our exclusive domain. They've been contemptuous of residents outreach and all efforts to mitigate.\nSpeaker 2: They let their employees, vendors and customers do whatever they want. They lied to police and city officials. There are daily and weekly occurrences in my neighborhood. Does that happen in your area? I hope not. It's time to end these parklets or sweeps and sweeps.\nSpeaker 2: It's truly time.\nSpeaker 3: Hello, Mayor and council members. My name is Julie Dean. I live in Belmont Shore and I've been there for 25 years. There's been or there was a certified class action suit filed against the city of Long Beach on behalf of persons with mobility disabilities.\nSpeaker 3: The parties reached a settlement in 2017 that's been entered as a binding order of the Federal Court and has a 30 year term through 2047. The law firm involved submitted a letter to the mayor and council members sorry, addressing sidewalk access for persons with mobility disabilities as it relates to the city's temporary and permanent parklet programs.\nSpeaker 3: They have photographs showing tables, chairs, signs, planters, and even some semi-permanent structures that reduce the clear width of the pedestrian right of way adjacent to park, located on and around Second Street in the Belmont Shore neighborhood. The photographs show bar and restaurant patrons congregating on sidewalks near the Parklets subject.\nSpeaker 3: Such obstructions deny access to persons with mobility disabilities. And I know this firsthand. The city has a binding court enforceable obligation to ensure the accessibility of its pedestrians. Right of way. In addition, the requirements of State and federal disability and discrimination laws.\nSpeaker 3: The settlement requires the city to maintain the accessible features of its pedestrian facilities so that persons with mobility disabilities will be able to use such safely and independently. Thank you very much. Good evening. Mayor Garcia and council members.\nSpeaker 3: I am ready to write. And I have been a resident of Belmont Shores since 1972, and I am still thrilled that I can stand on my corner and have the choice of at least a half dozen restaurants within one block in either direction.\nSpeaker 3: Living half a block from Second Street. My husband and I have frequented the restaurants and businesses there since the days of the Belmont Theater and Hops Hub. However, today, these days, many of the current restaurants are overreaching and they are encroaching on public property.\nSpeaker 3: They are taking up valuable parking places and they are placing tables on the sidewalks, impeding pedestrian traffic and parklets. On second, continue to be a safety hazard and an impediment to the to the vital thoroughfare for local residents, for the commuters and for visitors.\nSpeaker 3: In 1996. 97. Sidewalks were widened to accommodate for the specific purpose of accommodating outdoor dining. And since the new restaurants have been moving in, many of them have opened up the entire front of their estab.\nSpeaker 0: Your time has expired, ma'am. Name. Your time has expired.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening.\nSpeaker 3: Two weeks ago, our resident group made an impassioned plea to city council to not allow permanent parklets in Belmont. Sure, we shared a data based presentation explaining how Belmont sure is too dense in population and Second Street has is too busy a thoroughfare to host parklets.\nSpeaker 3: And now we see that public works is bending over backwards to allow restaurants to request by requesting a permanent status by August 1st. With that request, the restaurant can keep their so-called temporary parklets. The temporary parklets were to sunset June 30th.\nSpeaker 3: After three prior extensions, they were not constructed to last two years. Second Street now looks like a shantytown. The street smells like an alley. The sidewalks are filthy. And now we have to endure this. Three more months. We no longer have a situation of need on the part of the restaurant.\nSpeaker 3: The two year old Long Beach Restaurant Association, which has been crying, need somehow afforded a highly paid executive director to get city deals in its members favor. The borough has been laying the foundation for widespread permanent parklets since its inception in 2020 and using the cover of the pandemic to advance its goals.\nSpeaker 3: You have a chance tonight to make the.\nSpeaker 0: Ma'am, your time has expired.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. My name's Jeff Cozart, and I'm coming to you tonight from a little bit different perspective. I'm not a resident of Belmont. I live in the fourth District, but I owned the Belmont Athletic Club that is in the third district.\nSpeaker 2: And my concern with the Parklets speaks directly to the mature. When they first came about, I was 100% behind that program. It was needed. We were all fighting for our survival. Um. Now there are tons of businesses in Belmont Shore that are still fighting.\nSpeaker 2: And one of the things that we desperately need is our parking back. I have friends here tonight who are pro parklet. They are some of my friends. Clients. They owned restaurants down there and I get it for them.\nSpeaker 2: I probably want to keep it too. But this issue is very, very simple. It's just about what's fair. They needed help two years ago. I'm glad they got that help. But now the rest of us need what we all share back.\nSpeaker 2: It's really just that simple. Thank you. Mr. Mayor. Members of the city council. I'm Jimmy Lloyd, the owner of George's Greek Cafe in Belmont Shore, along with my sister, Nicky. You know, the Parker thing did save us. And it and still to this day does save a lot of people still in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: Don't want to sit inside yet. They're concerned, rightfully so. Everybody has a right to feel the way they do. We we have had a hard time this year with getting customers in staffing, cost of goods going up over 20% for our our specific needs.\nSpeaker 2: I think if we had the opportunity to get a permanent parklet, a lot of these concerns that came up before me would be probably be addressed in the process. I have hired Perkovic and Ruth, who has brought, I believe, two or three of the Parklets, and they've had no headway in trying to get the process into public\nSpeaker 2: works and get it done. So my concern is if yes, if there's a process to get to a permanent park that make them look nice, make sure they're safe, make sure that there's access for handicapped people and that's more walkable, then that process should be in place and we should be allowed to at least try to apply\nSpeaker 2: for it. I try to play it in 15 and it was shot down and now have been told even today I was texting with my architect that it's still not a real process to get a permanent parklet. These things can all be addressed and bad players can be excluded.\nSpeaker 2: And the ones that I want to do the good job and be good neighbors should be rewarded. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Will the following speakers please line up the podium? Nicky Clare. Pete Marsh. Rod Farentino. Jenny Cuevas. Sandy Watson. Nikki Clare. Pete Marsh. Rod Farentino. Jenny Cuevas and Sandy Watson.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. I think my brother just spoke for me. Oddly enough, I'm going right after him and I. I agree with what he's saying. We have been trying for a long time to go through the proper channels to get a permanent parklet with no headway, nobody getting back to us.\nSpeaker 3: I've read some of the articles in The Grunion and I understand and I agree with what people are saying. They're frustrated that we're not getting back to them and saying backing up what we're saying that we're going to help out and clean up and make it safe and make them and beautify them.\nSpeaker 3: But it's hard to to put that into play when we don't get any answers back and we can't. It doesn't make financial sense to spend an exorbitant amount of money to bring parklets up to standard of what's expected to be safe and esthetically pleasing at the expense of a temporary solution.\nSpeaker 3: So if we can get some headway in that, I know that that would take care of a lot of the problems, and there's certain guidelines that everybody has to follow. So thank you for tearing us out.\nSpeaker 0: Pete Marsh. Rod Farentino.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor. Council and city staff. My name is Rod Farentino. I'm a Long Beach resident, born and raised here. I'm also a restaurant owner and I am a member of the Long Beach Restaurant Association. To my knowledge, the agenda item this evening is not about Parklet or no PARKLET.\nSpeaker 2: It actually relates to terminating the temporary outdoor Parklet program on June 30th, or potentially extending the temporary outdoor dining period to some date in the future. And in this case, until September, September 30th, only for those that apply for permanency.\nSpeaker 2: The state of California still has its state of emergency in effect. I see many of you wearing mask here tonight. COVID is still here. Cases are rising once again. L.A. County is on the verge of a mask mandate.\nSpeaker 2: Also, the Alcohol Beverage Control has extended their outdoor drinking in these temporary spaces for one year after the California state of emergency ends. Folks, the state is still in a state of emergency. So if many people here tonight, I want to tell you that we're not in a state of emergency as it relates to COVID.\nSpeaker 2: I disagree. It is still here. Many members of the public still only dine outdoors. I get reservations. Online. Daily. Outdoor dining only. The city is considering terminating our outdoor dining program with no expedited, expedited plan to to get us through the process.\nSpeaker 2: We need the city to tell us what to do. By June 30th.\nSpeaker 0: Next week. Your police.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Jennifer Cuevas. I o Taco Shaw in Belmont. Shaw And I would like to thank you for letting us have the parklet throwing all this awful time in COVID, however, were not recovered. We do need the help still.\nSpeaker 3: We do have a lot of residents coming in loving the parklets. They just don't come to the meetings here. But we always we always get those feedback that they love it. It's important for us to keep at it.\nSpeaker 3: Where? At the beach. Beach. They absolutely just help us survive. We have I have 23 employees that depend on my decisions and your decisions and that actually help us keep on with the community and bring works back. And it's just important for us to keep the Parklets I understand that a lot of residents are not happy with\nSpeaker 3: the way that some owners are managing their stores, penalize them, do something with them. But Don, don't do it to all of us. It's not fair that we are doing what we are supposed to. We are following all the protocols.\nSpeaker 3: Help us survive. Help us keep going with, you know, the business and then just keep it open. Thank you. Hi. My name is Sandy Watson and I am a resident of the third district. I'm a retired schoolteacher from Albany, USD.\nSpeaker 3: When I think of when I think of Long Beach, we were in Beach City and we are beaches and walking on the shores and sunsets and outdoor dining. I love the outdoor dining. I think it's made a really great impact to downtown or to Second Street.\nSpeaker 3: I, I just am so impressed that you guys were able to get together and think out of the box. As a teacher, I think that's what we encourage our kids to do all the time and sneak out of the box.\nSpeaker 3: And together with the restaurant, you've come up with a way to do that. Let's not punish them now because they're not out of the whole thing. Started saying that they did it for economic recovery. You can't tell me the restaurants have recovered now when they're just starting to have their summer season, when they can have their their\nSpeaker 3: and their customers sit outside, which is what we want to do as residents. We don't want to be sitting inside. As the other gentleman said, it's outside dining that we're looking for. So I just hope that you will at least extend this parklets to the end of the summer to help those cuts in the restaurants and the\nSpeaker 3: residents. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Well, the following five speakers, please. Lineup. Katie Fahey. Anna Christiansen, Darryl Burns. Kieran Gow. Jeff Roe. Oh, thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Council members. Fellow citizens. Pete Marsh, District two. I'm a climate advocate. And so I rode my bike here today. I rode my bike this morning to a restaurant that we, my business partner and I chose because we wanted to eat outdoors.\nSpeaker 2: So we ate in a parklet. And my wife and I have only been we've only been indoors maybe three times in the last two and a half years. We still look for outdoor seating. So both for the health reasons, I agree with the folks who have said, you know, the pandemic is not over yet.\nSpeaker 2: We're fooling ourselves if we just say that. More, more big picture. I'm thinking about the future. We've got a good program in this city for establishing bike lanes and bike routes and bike ways. I'm just. Just learning. We've had our electric bikes for less than a month.\nSpeaker 2: I'm trying to replace a second car. I think we need to think about that in all aspects of urban planning to make our cities denser, more walkable, bikeable and livable. And so this discussion tonight, I think, is a microcosm of many bigger discussions to come as we try to increase the the vibrancy of this great city.\nSpeaker 2: Thanks very much.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name is Katie Fahy. I live in the third district and have lived there over 20 years. I am not against all parklets. I feel that they have enhanced our area on Second Street and people have been responsible for what they have.\nSpeaker 3: The owners, the managers. I can speak. I want to speak specifically to what affects me daily and my family. I live in Glendora. And when I was here, I was here back in December and told you having it on the sidewalk or having on the side street has brought dogs into my living room.\nSpeaker 3: I am the first line of defense. My yard and house have essentially become dog smoking section and bathroom. We can't make a blanket rule or policy. We need to do it individually and by people's actions and how they are responsible for their area.\nSpeaker 3: Dogs has shown time and time again they could care less of how they integrate into the community. People stand in the street, hanging on the parklet, watching the TVs, dog pastries, patrons hang out in the dry, cleaner parking lot, yelling back and forth at their friends.\nSpeaker 3: I have been told that they're adding new security. They're the ones who are smoking pot in the parking lot. Just this Saturday, I had someone peeing on the wall in my house and had to call the police. And I have kids that are watching this and it's not right.\nSpeaker 3: So you need to take responsibility and manage the parklets as well as. I hope the traffic directors listening to this because it is about.\nSpeaker 0: Your time is beginning, Ms. Christiansen.\nSpeaker 3: Fine. Just a comment. The Sierra Club most serious task force, third district resident born in Long Beach. Yada, yada, yada. On this issue, I'm concerned about two people that are violating what I think is just common courtesy and public safety.\nSpeaker 3: I noticed that the traffic director said that.\nSpeaker 2: That.\nSpeaker 3: They're going to assess who gets to.\nSpeaker 2: Stay and who gets to go.\nSpeaker 3: Based on a lot of complaints. And then he also said that people don't know how to complain. So I think there's a little.\nSpeaker 2: Bit of a.\nSpeaker 3: Break here. And I hope that people who learn how to complain and this can be expressed sooner rather than later will be able to be taken seriously, even if it's not hasn't occurred over a long period of time.\nSpeaker 3: I'm concerned about, I think, the word park. That's kind of strange. But anyway, I totally understand what Ms.. Cotton is saying about Down by the beach there, where an entire street has been taken over for a gym. And it's not just the street they take.\nSpeaker 3: The gym takes over the park and even the beach and even the bicycle path. You can't ride a bicycle down the path. They do classes on the bike path. So this particular business owner is pretty out of control and and has his own outdoor deck.\nSpeaker 3: So what I find is interesting. You know.\nSpeaker 0: As Christiansen, your times expired.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. My name's Darryl Burns. I live on a glendora street in Belmont. Sure. And, you know, I think I came and spoke here a few months ago, and I was very frustrated with one establishment down the street, Doug's bar.\nSpeaker 2: And but at that point in time, I was really very supportive of all the other parklets supportive of this effort and really felt like, you know, how do we hold some some places accountable? I guess what I've learned is you can't hold them accountable once they have a parklet.\nSpeaker 2: And so my concern about extending where I was very flexible in the beginning, I would say I really encourage you to not extend the parklets as far as permanent parklets. I hope you put a process in place where there is a grievance process.\nSpeaker 2: What I have found is a huge burden falls on the community to have to hold them accountable. I know there are some inspections and some things done when there's complaints. Those folks are probably not out there one in the morning.\nSpeaker 2: I know people say the parklets are closed at that point in time. Patrons still go out and hang out there. As one of the previous speakers said, you know, we had someone come and just urinate right in front of us.\nSpeaker 2: You know, we had another person later in the evening, he walked by, fell down on all fours. I went over to check on him. He said he drank too much, got up, stumbled around, and then went back to the bar.\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, I think the quality of life. Good evening, everyone. My name is Karen Goff on the 908 restaurant El Ultimo Pizzeria. And then I'm the president of the Long Beach Restaurant Association. Oakland. San Luis Obispo. San Francisco.\nSpeaker 2: Manhattan Beach. Claremont. Santa monica. Most of Orange County cities. A bunch of cities and San Diego have all decided to extend the temporary permit process for Parklets. That's like what? Somehow in Long Beach we can only do it for 30 days.\nSpeaker 2: We've asked for over a year for an easier path towards what the permanent parklet process is, and we haven't really gotten any movement on that. It's cumbersome. It's 27 pages. There's only two architecture firms that you can hire.\nSpeaker 2: It's like they're backed up. The city is short staffed. We've heard that from all of you. That's like so we can't even get the parklets approved in a timely fashion. All we're asking for is that we get a we get a path towards temporary being extended into such a time to where we have a permanent parklet process\nSpeaker 2: that works for the entire city and the restaurant community. We know there's a lot of people from downtown. Sure. That have an issue with Parklets. We get it. We thank them for their patience and helping us through this whole time and COVID.\nSpeaker 2: However, Bellman sure doesn't dictate policy for the entire city, so we need to take that into consideration and go from there. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Well, the following speakers, please line up the podium. Susan Row. Nadia Tushnet. Michael Neufeld. Kurt Schneider.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, council members and Mayor Garcia. When I heard that on January, on January 1st, we were going to have to end the PARKLET program on June 30th. Two weeks later, I started applying for the process. I went to an architecture firm.\nSpeaker 2: I got told. We'll get to you when we get to you. It's been five and a half months. I've had one meeting with the architecture firm. No quote, except for him to tell me it's going to be 40 to $60000 to put a permanent parklet in and to lose two thirds of them.\nSpeaker 2: Excuse me, one third of my current parklet. I don't know how people say that this is not a survival instinct for us. We're all we've all made do during COVID. We have started to come out of it. COVID is not over.\nSpeaker 2: Mask mandates are coming back. And I don't think that anybody has also considered that for every park that closes, at least 1 to 2 employees will be losing their jobs from our restaurants because we have nothing to give them for shifts.\nSpeaker 2: So please consider extending and making the process for us to go permanent for us who are doing the right thing easier. We want to do the right thing. We want to make our parklets beautiful. We want to make Long Beach beautiful.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. I'm Susan Rowe. And I actually lived in Belmont Heights about three blocks off of Second Street. Second Street used to be a destination that I would go to frequently with my daughter for Christmas parades and the Halloween candy walk, the stroll and savors.\nSpeaker 3: I can't imagine any of that stuff happening now. There are shuttered businesses there. I wouldn't put a business on that street right now because you can't even see the businesses with all of the parklets. I have a prepared statement, but I did want to say I didn't get a survey and it's not more walkable.\nSpeaker 3: I rarely go there anymore. So it's time to end the temporary parklets. The bars and restaurants have received hundreds of thousands of dollars of loans that were forgiven. Dogs alone, one of the worst offenders of community standards and frequent violator of Parklet rules, got 370,000.\nSpeaker 3: Belmont Brewing Company got $923,000. Iconix Fitness $717,000. The bars and restaurants have received extensive state aid. Even now, the city continues to dole out its remaining relief funds. To them, permit fees were way for the entirety of the pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: To date, the Libra won extra funds up to $10,000 for bars and restaurants to create outdoor dining and thousands more to update their technology. No other sector of city businesses has received aid anywhere close to these amounts. No individual resident received rescue funds that lasted more than a month.\nSpeaker 3: Rust.\nSpeaker 0: Ma'am, your time has expired.\nSpeaker 3: Hello. My name's Nadir Tushnet, and I've been living in Long Beach for almost 40 years. Not quite at the shore. But when I first moved here, one of the things I liked to do was I'm a great wanderer and wandered around the businesses in the shore.\nSpeaker 3: I want to talk about I understand the economic impact of the cost of COVID on on restaurants. But right now, there was two other economic impacts that we should take into account. First of all, there is a high cost to the city of oversight and accountability around the existing parklets we heard it described.\nSpeaker 3: So that's a cost that should be taken into account as we move on with this. There's also the economic impact on the non restaurant businesses. If you can't wander down the street, which you can't, I'll tell you, then those businesses suffer.\nSpeaker 3: We talk a lot. I hear a lot of talk about choosing winners and losers. If we're going to choose restaurants over other kinds of businesses as the winners and the other businesses are the losers, I'm not sure that that's actually fair.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, everybody. Mayor Council. Uh, with respect, first of all, to Mr. America's admonishment of what we've been doing for six months in terms of not a lot of us being able to get the paperwork. And I think there was a comment in the back there what we've been doing.\nSpeaker 2: I think I can speak on behalf of all the restaurant owners in the room. We've been washing our own dishes and cooking all the food for the guests because we can't seem to find workers to do that. That's what we've been doing for six months, in addition to running our businesses and losing money.\nSpeaker 2: So the reality is, is that and I have an IP, I don't have a parklet clip, but I'm certainly speaking as a fiduciary on behalf of the other the other restaurant owners here. City of L.A. just extended this to March for a variety of reasons.\nSpeaker 2: And this shouldn't be a permanent situation. We know that. But there's just not enough time. It's premature. You've heard enough about the process with respect to permanent parklets. We need more time. We need more time to work with you.\nSpeaker 2: We need more time to clean up the Parklets you know, we need to address that. It's a real problem and we get it. And you know, as a founding member of the borough, you have our commitment that we want to work with you and we want to understand what we need to do to improve it.\nSpeaker 2: It's not a perfect program. It's not a perfect process. But we've been just trying to survive and keep 20,000 restaurant workers employed in the city of Long Beach. So we ask for a little bit more time and a little bit more clarity and a little bit more communication so that we can help you have the city that\nSpeaker 2: you vision here and help us stay in business. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. City Council people and the well-behaved baby. Tonight, I'd like to address as the president of the Belmont Shore Business Association to thank all of you and city staff for what you've done, letting us have these parklets as long as we've had.\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to reiterate everything everybody else has already said. So many great comments have made. There's been falsities as well, but I'm here for positivity. What I will say today is that if the city enforces the municipal codes, the ADA rules, we will be forced to adhere.\nSpeaker 2: I am here to be your biggest advocate. As a president of the Belmont Shore Business Association, five feet. We have to have five feet. I want to see anybody with ADA issues to never have a problem in Belmont Shore.\nSpeaker 2: I want you to come to Belmont Shore and know that we care for you and want you to visit our restaurants and our retail. That is nobody's intent but a poor operator. They should be fined. They should be warned first and then find.\nSpeaker 2: I am here to back you 100%. What I will tell you right now is that to extend this would be a godsend to some. We are not through this. The permanency is an issue. I have my plans ready from my own place and so many of the other people are ready to go.\nSpeaker 2: If Mr. Hickman and DeKoe do this, we will help you. We will work well with you. Thank you so much. Your staff has been fantastic.\nSpeaker 0: Your time has expired. Thank you. That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I'm going I also have some a couple questions as well, but I'm going to turn it back over to Councilman Price and then we'll go. Go then, councilman.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So a couple of issues. Can someone please address the ADA concerns? And let me just make one thing very clear that I have been consistent across the board both to the restaurants and non restaurants that have parklets as well as the residents that I absolutely believe that Belmont Shore is in a different situation than Parklets throughout\nSpeaker 4: the city and that Belmont Shaw needs to be considered differently and separately for a couple of reasons. One, the proximity of homes to the residences, given the density, is different in Belmont Shaw than some other business corridors that have parklets.\nSpeaker 4: One of the residents here talked about her house literally on the alley that is adjacent to one of the businesses. That's an unusual situation and an unusual dynamic. And I've been very clear with every entity that has asked me repeatedly that Belmont Shore is differently situated and that because of parking issues, because it's in the coastal zone\nSpeaker 4: , that it's going to have to be treated differently. I've been very consistent with that in terms of the traffic engineers determination. Also, the traffic speeds and volumes on Belmont Shore are different. We don't have the option to close down a lane.\nSpeaker 4: I know people have suggested that in the past to allow for parklets the volume on that street is just too great. We can't close down a lane. I wish we could consider that, but we can't even consider that.\nSpeaker 4: It would be horrific for traffic. The second thing that I think is is very clear is obviously because we have a lot going on in Belmont. Sure, the ADA issues might be different in Belmont Shore than other places given the number of Parklets.\nSpeaker 4: So can someone speak to that? Are we. Is it currently are we not in compliance? Have we considered that? What's the status.\nSpeaker 3: There?\nSpeaker 8: Councilwoman, we do have a group of people who work in the transportation mobility team. We do go out and walk the entire corridor from Bayshore to Livingston, both sides of the road on multiple occasions. I've been out there four or five times myself.\nSpeaker 8: When we do these walks and inspections, we're checking for a variety of things, including ADA clearances that we have to maintain. We do talk to businesses, managers, whoever is on site that can make the adjustment with tables, chairs, or maybe even keeping the patrons out of the walkway.\nSpeaker 8: We also have a task force that goes out and responds to similar issues as well. The problem is, is that we can't be out there 24 seven. So as we walk away from that business after clearing up whatever that particular issue is, you know, one hour later, it could rise up again.\nSpeaker 8: So we just don't have that constant presence there. But we are checking on that issue constantly regarding ADA accessibility.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about. I know that we said that there's no permanent options for Opie's, but my understanding is some of the Opie's that are on private property have been advised that they may be able to stay if, for example, they're able to find sufficient parking.\nSpeaker 4: For example, row is one of those where the Opie is in the back and they've been advised that if parking can be found that that's possibly and an avenue. And I would just want to confirm that.\nSpeaker 2: Council Member Christopher We are working with that business row and have spoken to others. So in those circumstances, a a property owner can always come into the city and discuss improvements. And that particular location, they are going to secure offsite parking and then remove parking spaces from their site plan.\nSpeaker 2: But that will be a permanent condition on private property that is permitted through development services, as building any structure would be. So it's not that they will have a permanent OCP, the O p will go away, and they will have secured a way to have outdoor dining on their private property as a permanent feature of their restaurant\nSpeaker 4: . Okay. Thank you. So I have a motion regarding. I know that Councilwoman Sara made a motion to extend the ops till September 30th, but I want to ask about a modification to that. What I'd like to do is for the ops, I would like a process for the ops whereby if they're requesting an extension that they apply\nSpeaker 4: for that extension to our public works department and that a decision be made on a case by case basis regarding whether or not that PARKLET or that OPI can be extended till September 30th. And for considerations such as parking impacts, residential impacts, impact on adjoining businesses, that those be considered in that decision process.\nSpeaker 4: Councilwoman Sara, are you okay with that? So I just want to clarify said that if they if they wanted to extend it, they would have to apply for that extension for just three months, though. I don't know that they have to go through an application process, but an expression of interest is what we have right now for\nSpeaker 4: those businesses that are on a list. I just didn't want to make it onerous. Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: Just a point of clarification to move forward. My understanding was that the AP exemption was for only apps issued on private property. That's how I understood it. So I don't know if that's changing. Now to the opens would go through the Special Events Office and not the Public Works Department.\nSpeaker 2: So I defer to Tasha Day to discuss the impact on an application that it would have on staff.\nSpeaker 3: So most of them would have to reapply. Council member as they would have to turn in current drawings for those new structures or modified structures as well as the proper insurance to maintain those they are sent to sun.\nSpeaker 3: They are set to sunset on June 30th.\nSpeaker 4: So we would have to go through that entire process of collecting all that data. It's doable, but they would all.\nSpeaker 3: Have to reapply.\nSpeaker 4: They would all have to reapply to go beyond June 30th.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, they would have to reapply and we would.\nSpeaker 4: Have to vet all of their insurance requirements again. And that's regardless of what we do tonight. Yes. Oh, okay. No, no, no. Only if you agree with them.\nSpeaker 3: If you extend them past the 30th.\nSpeaker 4: They would have to do that. If we extend them past the 30th, they would have to do that for private and private property. And public property. Yes. Can. My motion wasn't to extend beyond September 30. I think it's June 30th.\nSpeaker 4: All right. Which 30th are we talking about?\nSpeaker 3: June 30th. Okay.\nSpeaker 4: So to extend them beyond June 30th, they'd have to apply. That's correct. So I don't. So that we couldn't automatically extend them beyond June 30th. They would have to apply to go beyond June 30th.\nSpeaker 3: They would reapply like they have been. So they've been doing this this whole time.\nSpeaker 4: So every time the APIs are extended.\nSpeaker 3: We contact everyone and they have to resubmit their information.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So they would have to reapply and then you would do an evaluation as to whether you grant it based on that application? That is correct. Okay. So we would be saying if they're currently an existing AP, they could apply to go till September 30th, but they still have to go through the application process.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. And that application process would involve presumably consideration of the comments that have been expressed tonight in terms of parking impacts and other impacts. Yes, that's correct. And encroachment on other businesses. Yes. Okay. So they would have to apply even weaker.\nSpeaker 4: So what we're saying now is you could apply up to September. You could apply to extend up to September 30th. Yes.\nSpeaker 3: That's the motion.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. All right. I may want to come back to that. I'm out of time, so I'll come back up. Sorry.\nSpeaker 7: I think Councilman Allen was next.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I do appreciate everyone that came out to talk, but I do think that these temporary parklets need to come to an end. I know that we have done everything that we can do. When these when the restaurants really needed our help, I think we all rallied around.\nSpeaker 3: I think we did as council. We did as as patrons. And I absolutely love the outdoor dining. And but I do have concerns with these temporary parklets. All the concerns that a lot of people expressed tonight. I'm also.\nSpeaker 3: Wondering, you know, we've had these the restaurants have had a really long time to get these these applications in. But what I've heard from some of these businesses that they haven't we haven't gotten back to them for their permanent.\nSpeaker 3: So that's concerning to me because it's if we're saying you have this time period to to apply and they're seeing that they haven't got backs, I really need to understand what's happening there because that's that's problematic. And I also wonder if there's a good number of businesses that have expressed interest but yet haven't moved forward.\nSpeaker 3: And I don't know what's happening there either. If someone can speak on that, perhaps they're going to keep the temporary parklets as long as they can. I mean, I would imagine it's good for their business and it's kind of, you know, free space.\nSpeaker 3: But why are they not applying for this permanent position? So permanent a parklet. So if someone can help me understand what's happening there, I appreciate it.\nSpeaker 8: Yes, Councilwoman, let me point out that we we have had permanent parklet permits issued recently. I mentioned that we have four that are currently in the review process, three are in CD1 and one is in CD seven. And we have also already converted four temporary parklets to permanent two and CD1 one in CD two and one in\nSpeaker 8: CD five. So, so when we do have locations that are meeting their requirements, paying the fees, putting in their applications and their their plans, a complete application, those permits move forward. We do have some businesses who are who have talked to the permit technicians.\nSpeaker 8: They submit packages and they're not complete. They're missing an engineer stamp. They're missing a signature. So those processes are deemed incomplete. But recently we've had a lot of discussion about this meeting and the outcome of this meeting and the fact that many folks who are thinking about going permanent, they still need Coastal Commission approval to make that\nSpeaker 8: approval and the reality of the permanent park that happen. So it's still a bit of a process, but we're not just stopping the entire program. That's not that's not the case.\nSpeaker 3: So we heard a business say that they have applied and haven't heard back from our team. So what do you say to that? Like, how does that happen?\nSpeaker 8: When I hear something like that, I really want to talk to that business and find out who they are, where they are, and what they where they are in the process. Most of our permit technicians are very reliable.\nSpeaker 8: They contact the businesses. So I would I would like to just follow up and see what we can do to make that process more efficient.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Come tomorrow, Ringo.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. And thank you. Because remember, Alan, you brought up a slide here that I was looking at right now, and I was going to ask a question about it. And that's slide 11, where you mentioned that the the four businesses that went from temporary and permanent to a silly one, one, two, three, two, one and C\nSpeaker 5: five. The four businesses that applied for that are currently under review, three in CD1 and one in CD seven and in the 30 businesses that only expressed interest in the formal establishment, the Parklets seven in CD2 and 23 in CD3 in three.\nSpeaker 5: But obviously the, the, the one item here that put my ears was the, the businesses that are located in the coastal zone and needing a coastal development permit. How many of those businesses that we have are those 30 of fit within that the coastal zone that you know of?\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Councilman. That's a very good question. Right now, we have 30 businesses that have expressed interest only in obtaining a permanent parklet permit. And I would say approximately half of those between 15 and 20 at the most are actually within a local Coastal Commission jurisdiction.\nSpeaker 8: So they will need a local permit, which we do here at the city. They don't have to go to Sacramento for that project. I mean, for that permit.\nSpeaker 5: It was part of the LCP as well.\nSpeaker 8: But you're correct. But the thing is, is that, you know, when businesses show interest, that doesn't mean that they've committed fully to the process. And we don't anticipate that we're going to have 30 businesses knocking on our door right now to get a permit.\nSpeaker 5: You know, as I was in the case, I was only interested in how many do you think are in the coastal zone that would have to apply? What I'm basically looking at is it appears that those businesses that are in the coastal zone would have to go through another layer or another process of getting a permanent parklet\nSpeaker 5: . Would that be correct?\nSpeaker 8: That's correct. I would say that the final step in the process is that coastal, local coastal commission approval. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Well, good luck with that. It takes so long with the Coastal Commission, though, I'll tell you. I know experience. Yes. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: So and just to just to clarify that that would be an LCP that would not be going to the the full coastal commission. So when they're at that process, we're deeming them pretty much complete. So they have a couple more things to do.\nSpeaker 6: They in our mind would be deemed feasible. They'd be eligible for this extension. There's a small handful of those right now. It's the ones that haven't gotten through the architect yet that haven't been able to put up the dollars and the investment to make something like this occur.\nSpeaker 5: If we're purposes of the audience, LCP is a local coastal program will permit that the city has already established in terms of rules of how businesses can go into the coastal zone. So just to put clarification on that, that's all I have.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, councilmember. With screening still loading here, the councilman price is next.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Okay, so on that note. The 17 or so businesses that are in Belmont Shore, Naples that are fall in the coastal zone, who have expressed an interest, have not been given an application process. At least some of them have been told there is no application process.\nSpeaker 4: So that's where I feel like there's a little bit of unfairness here. We're saying if you've applied we were saying they had all this time to apply, okay, but they haven't been given a meaningful application process. So those that are on the list should be given an opportunity to actually apply so that they can get a permanent\nSpeaker 4: parklet because and maybe the city attorney needs to weigh in here, our current permanent PARKLET program. Which was established in 2018. Does not have a carve out for Belmont Shore. So if you're a business owner. In a different district and you are given the opportunity to apply for a permanent parklet and you're a business owner in Belmont\nSpeaker 4: . Sure, you still have the same opportunity to apply for a permanent parklet because our own rules don't carve out the coastal zone, correct? That's correct. Councilmember Price. There is no carve out for the second for second Street or for Belmont Shore.\nSpeaker 4: There are safety considerations and those considerations are applied on a case by case basis for every parklet. Exactly. And I've been very clear with all the businesses in Belmont. Sure. That want to convert to permanent that is going to be a decision that the traffic engineer is going to make based on the traffic and the parking situation\nSpeaker 4: in Belmont. Sure. So my problem is they haven't been given an opportunity. So what I would like to make a motion tonight is if they have expressed an interest. By June 30th. And they're going to go through the application process.\nSpeaker 4: And it's they are deemed feasible to go through the application process. Then I'm okay with option B, which means they need to complete their process by August 1st. Okay. What I don't want is if there are businesses that the traffic engineer has already deemed are infeasible.\nSpeaker 4: For whatever reason, traffic concerns, blind spots, neighborhood concerns, whatever. I don't want to wait until August 1st if we've already made that determination. So what I would like is by June 30th, the traffic engineer to let those people that are on the list are still interested in having a permanent parklet.\nSpeaker 4: They need to notify our public works department by June 30th. Our Public Works Department by June 30th needs to let them know if they are deemed a feasible applicant or not. If they are deemed feasible, then they can go forward with the application process, which we have not afforded them meaningfully up until this point.\nSpeaker 4: For those businesses in the coastal area and they can go through that process under option B, if they are deemed infeasible, then they must tear down their temporary PARKLET By July 15th, we give them two weeks to tear it down.\nSpeaker 4: If they have an appeal process, then they can go through the appeal process. But that's the timeline that I would like connected to option B. Is that possible?\nSpeaker 6: So I'd like the team to explain or to respond to that. I think that is possible. I'd like to hear from them. I do want them also to give a little bit of information on that. They have not had a process available.\nSpeaker 6: We do believe they have had a process available and this is changing it slightly. They have them do interest and then a process. So I'd like to turn to Christopher Coons and to Karl to talk through the can we do this and what process have they had available so far?\nSpeaker 7: So Councilmember, I'm going to start and then.\nSpeaker 2: Carl is going to.\nSpeaker 8: Take over.\nSpeaker 2: So there's two departments that touch these potential permanent parklets and maybe no one in this room. But we have had applicants that have.\nSpeaker 8: Tried to do the process out of.\nSpeaker 2: Order and have been directed not to do that. So development services is not has not will not process any of these permits until they've obtained their public works approval. The public works process, for good reasons is extensive and it requires a lot of materials that have to be turned into.\nSpeaker 2: Carl We have had applicants attempt to skip that step entirely and lodge an application with development services. We've rejected a number of those because they have to obtain their safety related approval first before we can look at the suitability and the cost or so on.\nSpeaker 2: So Carl is going to talk about his process.\nSpeaker 8: Yes, we have a process where we look at, you know, the location, exactly the footprint, many of the things that we've already talked about as far as sightlines accessibility, whether they're over utilities, a lot of research, an investigation goes into whether we're going to approve one of these locations.\nSpeaker 8: And of course, we're taking into consideration the neighborhood quality of life questions that come into play. But again, we don't expect to see 30 businesses rushing to us to install permanent parklets. Again, it's a major financial commitment as one of the speakers mentioned.\nSpeaker 8: And we feel that regardless of how many come in, we're going to be able to make the process more efficient, address their concerns and, you know, put them on the right path to getting this approval if they are deemed feasible.\nSpeaker 4: Okay, so my time is up, so I'll come back up.\nSpeaker 2: If I could add something to that for what I heard you say, Councilmember, is that businesses be allowed to have until June 30th to express their interest and then city staff will respond by June 30th. And that's not possible.\nSpeaker 2: We would need if we have 510 people apply at June 30th, we can't guarantee that we'll get back to them on the same day. Additionally, if we find that a business is not feasible, we can claim that they're not feasible, have their temporary parklet removed, but we cannot stop them from applying for a permanent parklet down the\nSpeaker 2: road.\nSpeaker 4: Of course. Of course. And you're absolutely right. My understanding was that if they're not on the interest list right now. They're not going to be able to apply, but that's why I was saying the June 30th. But we can make it express interest by June 20th and a decision will be made by June 30th.\nSpeaker 6: That's just what we need is a date by which you can apply for it. Either we don't allow any more beyond the 30 that have already talked to us, or we determine a date in the future to get your your interest letter in.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So I'm going to queue back up because my time is up.\nSpeaker 7: Councilman's in the house.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Just for clarification, one of the things that I see with the PARKLETS is that even though we're trying to terminate the the temporary parklets, we're also giving the opportunity to make those.\nSpeaker 3: Parklets.\nSpeaker 4: Permanent, those that are feasible. I think that if we could actually look at the ad, all of the parklets that we have right now and really work with the owners of those that are not feasible to let them know that it's not going to be possible because of many things that Mr. Karl may me foresee.\nSpeaker 4: I think that's important to let them know and not lead them on that. It might be possible because I'm sure that there's some that are very, very easy to see that that wouldn't work for many reasons. So I think that, you know, I would like to say and encourage you to please, please look at those and address\nSpeaker 4: those and and make sure that the businesses know.\nSpeaker 3: Also, I.\nSpeaker 4: Feel that being in the downtown, the Parklets have been great for so many reasons. I mean, we are downtown. I do I do think we're different from other districts and stuff, but I think that being able to help the businesses establish or go through the process of applying.\nSpeaker 3: For a parklet.\nSpeaker 4: And actually looking at certain barriers that have been preventing them to make.\nSpeaker 3: That park.\nSpeaker 4: Parklet permanent. I think it's.\nSpeaker 3: Also important to look.\nSpeaker 4: At and work with each business on a business to business basis to see what we can do as a city to help them make that that parklet permanent. So I know that's a lot of work, and I know that we're really trying to help everyone here.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you for all the work that you've already done and the work that is ahead.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Next up is Councilman Allen and we have Councilman Prescott. I have some you guys might have a couple questions. Thank you. And then we'll we'll get back to the speaker's list. So I just have a couple of questions for staff and just some general comments.\nSpeaker 7: I want to just go back just one, one step and think the council certainly I have been a supporter of our Open Streets program, which a parklets were a part of since day one. For me, it was always first and foremost about the pandemic, making sure that people were safe, making sure that people had options to be\nSpeaker 7: outdoors, and also to ensure that we didn't lose our restaurants and small businesses across our city. And there is no question that the open space and the PARKLET program has been a lifeline for small businesses, for restaurants and for workers.\nSpeaker 7: I also agree and understand that there are businesses and there are parklets or in some cases some of the parking lot programs that have been a nuisance. I think one was mentioned in particular that I have noticed as well that have been problematic.\nSpeaker 7: There have there have been in some cases media issues. And also all of that is also true. And certainly I think everyone senses of the the the frustration of many members of community, particularly in Belmont Shore. So I think all of that is is is true.\nSpeaker 7: At the same time, I just want to make sure what I'm also hearing is I have heard an unconvincing argument that we have set up a system that's been accessible and successful for our small business owners to actually go through and apply for a permanent process.\nSpeaker 7: Is it is it true that there are only two architectural firms that they can actually use? That's what I heard. That can't be true.\nSpeaker 2: So Karl and I were just conversing. There's two firms that do a lot of this work and are advertising to clients that they could provide these services to them. What the city is looking for is that it's a license designed professional that you're working with a licensed architect and a licensed engineer.\nSpeaker 2: There's hundreds of thousands of those available and we don't discriminate. There was one firm referenced in the public testimony, but there's no requirement from the city that the application be prepared by that firm.\nSpeaker 7: So so so there's we've got a variety of architects and firms and other folks to go.\nSpeaker 2: And Carl has a it's on our website, a guide, a parklet guide that we developed together a few.\nSpeaker 8: Years ago that.\nSpeaker 2: Takes businesses.\nSpeaker 8: Step by step through the.\nSpeaker 2: Application process. So we can always do better. But I think here at the staff table. To us that the process is pretty straightforward, but that process just may simply a permanent parklet may be inappropriate for many of the businesses that have a temporary one.\nSpeaker 7: And so so I appreciate that. And so let me can I ask also because on most issues, when it comes to business issues or planning or permitting issues, you know, you oftentimes hear from business owners who are having a hard time.\nSpeaker 7: And that's that happens for whatever reason in this particular issue. It seems to be more overwhelmingly, at least what I hear from business folks. That is a very difficult process, even more so than other processes that we have in the city.\nSpeaker 7: So that's where my concerns stem from. Can I ask you this question also on the because I agree with a lot of what Councilman Price said about just fairness and making sure that those that have shown interest have an actual opportunity to apply and go through a process.\nSpeaker 7: I think that's very fair. I think I hope that's where the council heads tonight. There are areas so and I'm just and I maybe and maybe the staff knows or doesn't know this just by those that have been permitted already, have determinations already been made that certain corridors cannot have any parklets.\nSpeaker 8: Well, Mr. Mayor, the the fact is, is that we are trying to discourage the installation of permanent parklets on any roadway where the speed limit is posted above 20 miles an hour at 25 miles an hour. Now, there are some exceptions on some corridors where maybe the speed limit is 30 miles an hour on a certain section\nSpeaker 8: . And we can make accommodations depending on different engineering designs, ball boats and things like that to make that parklets safe for permanent installation. But for the most part, if it's not 25 miles an hour, we're not going to recommend a permanent parklet.\nSpeaker 7: And I, of course, operate. I'm not a traffic engineer. So I you know, I understand the safety rules that are set up for for for that. So, for example, because I don't on the top of my head know what streets are eligible or not.\nSpeaker 7: So let's say I am on on Second Street over in Naples, Nico's you other restaurants and in the neighborhood we heard a couple a couple tonight. Are they eligible or are they just are we telling folks who are just not eligible for a parklet if it's if they're eligible or not?\nSpeaker 8: What we're telling businesses is that if they're on a roadway where this posted speed limit is, let's say, 45 miles an hour, there's not much you can do from a designs standpoint to make that permanent parklet safe. However, you mentioned Naples Island.\nSpeaker 8: We are in the process of not only trying to lower the speed limit there, but Naples is very unique that that will call it eastbound roadways, very wide. There's a large parking zone, there's a large buffer and there's a large bike lane.\nSpeaker 8: So there's a large distance between the travel lane and the curb line. So in Naples Island, it's a little unique. So even though it's posted 35 and we're in the process of trying to drop that speed limits of 30, we will be willing to entertain an application from one of those businesses on Naples Island.\nSpeaker 7: So those those businesses would be considered. So if one of those businesses on the island was interested or showed interest, they would be put on this interest category.\nSpeaker 8: Yes, that's.\nSpeaker 7: Correct. And then how about for applicants for restaurants on Second Street in Beaumont? Sure.\nSpeaker 8: The same thing has already taken place where they've notified us their interest. I have a list of 30 of them. And again, it's just interest only. Right. And that's the next step that allows them to take to the next step to determine, you know, is this feasible for them?\nSpeaker 8: Are they committed to the process financially as well?\nSpeaker 7: And then those those are those 30 that are on that list would be all eligible to continue their process if they would like to.\nSpeaker 8: Well, currently, there's about ten on this list that I have already looked at, investigated, and I've already deemed them not feasible for installation for various reasons.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And then I'm assuming that if those that are not feasible for installation, we're letting them know right away.\nSpeaker 8: That's correct. So if they make contact with us again with the permit team, we would immediately notify them, hey, this is the problem, this is the situation. We don't think you're feasible now. You can apply if you want to.\nSpeaker 8: We're telling you right upfront it's not going to be an easy go.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Because I think one of the things that's that's fair to the business owner also is that we're proactively honest with them. If it's not going to be feasible from a traffic perspective, from a safety perspective, I'm just hoping that we're being honest and telling them this is not going to work and that we're being that we're\nSpeaker 7: that at least is giving them the the information that we the best submission that we have at that moment.\nSpeaker 8: That is our intention.\nSpeaker 7: And so so we haven't it's our intention or we haven't done that yet, or we're going to do that.\nSpeaker 8: We're going to do that. And when we take the next step and let's say ten of those businesses that have shown interest, let's say they come in to our permit technicians and they say we want to take the next step and put in our application, pay the initial fees and put their their design plans.\nSpeaker 8: We're going to say, hey, you know, this may not be a good installation for X, Y, Z. This is why the traffic engineers already looked at this. I won't name the business, but there's some that are that have a very small frontage right on the side of a corner of a of a side street.\nSpeaker 8: It's not going to work. It's unsafe.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 7: So we I think my time is probably up to. But have we my last time finally have we at any point told any businesses yet that they are not going to be eligible? Or is that something that is in the next step?\nSpeaker 8: We have not done that yet.\nSpeaker 7: And that's probably part of the issue here, I imagine, is that there's a lot of uncertainty. Okay. I appreciate that. Come back to me. But let me go back to Councilman Price and we'll and we'll keep going.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You hit on all the right questions. Let me just say. The information that you guys are sharing tonight. With all due respect, is not consistent with what was shared with the businesses. I have multiple emails here where they were told they couldn't apply because they're in the coastal zone.\nSpeaker 4: We didn't have a process yet because they're in the coastal zone. It's there's all sorts of confusion. So and let me also make it very clear, if I didn't already. We're a city with a lot of diversity and a lot of diverse business corridors.\nSpeaker 4: So if this is not an issue in other business corridors and people want to extend till March then and it's a different district or different business quarter, then that's fine. I'm just. My motion is based on the observations of the residents that came tonight and what I hear every single day.\nSpeaker 4: And I have said from day one that Belmont Shore is different because of the proximity to homes, because of the traffic volumes, because of the parking.\nSpeaker 3: With 52.\nSpeaker 4: Parking spaces right now that are lost due to parklets. That's a huge impact in Belmont. Sure. And it's a huge impact for the Coastal Commission. This is a major priority for the Coastal Commission. And I think it's it's important for us to try to to shrink it down.\nSpeaker 4: So. Right now, of the 30 that have expressed an interest, I believe about 17 of them are in the Belmont Shore corridor. And other than those 17, all the other ones that have not expressed an interest would go away automatically on June the 30th of the 17 or so that have already expressed an interest or any others\nSpeaker 4: that would express interest by June 20th. The public works department, through the traffic engineer, will notify them by June 30th whether or not they are feasible to move forward because we don't want them to spend any money if we're deeming them to be not feasible.\nSpeaker 4: That's not fair. They will have an opportunity to appeal that decision, as my understanding will go through that process. But. Is that correct, that they have an opportunity to appeal the word process or no?\nSpeaker 8: I wouldn't say it's a formal appeal process, but they would have the opportunity to have a discussion with us to learn why it is it wouldn't be feasible.\nSpeaker 4: And they might say to you, okay, what if I change the design here? What if I move it there?\nSpeaker 8: Correct. And that's where we would rely on the design to show us what they're actually proposing.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Got it. But I just want them to know by June 30th, if they're not feasible, they need to go away that that parklet needs to go away if it's deemed not feasible and you go through your process.\nSpeaker 2: Ah.\nSpeaker 8: I understand.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Perfect. And then this streamlining. I mean, I want to also make sure that everybody understands that we've got to have we cannot talk about being business friendly if we cannot offer a process that's easy to follow and expedited.\nSpeaker 4: And I already heard staff say it was going to be expedited. And I appreciate that. And I'm going to I realize this is a lot to put on staff. And look, we did the very best we could with open streets to try to accommodate some sort of outdoor dining option.\nSpeaker 4: And I know this is a burden on city staff, but extending the process even longer frustrates the businesses and certainly it's not fair to the residents. So if this has got to be high priority until August 1st to figure out how do we process these applications and what can we do?\nSpeaker 4: Okay. I think I think I'm good on the piece. I believe the OP's. The ones on private property. You know, I don't think they should. I think they should have to get the opportunity to apply for an extension.\nSpeaker 4: And I think the ones on public property should get the opportunity to apply as well and go through that process. But I do not believe under any circumstances they should be encroaching in front of another business. I just don't think that's fair.\nSpeaker 4: So those are my thoughts. I'm not sure if I've given enough clarity with the motion, but really it's option B. But we're moving the timeline for public works to let businesses know that they're not feasible up to June 30th, so that if they're not feasible, that parklet is eliminated.\nSpeaker 4: If they are feasible, then they're allowed to go through the application process, which is outlined under option B.\nSpeaker 6: Was there a date by which they have to submit their interest?\nSpeaker 4: A June 20th.\nSpeaker 6: June 20th. Okay. So then four days from now, the ones that have submitted interest, we already have that. If there's anyone else, they have basically four days to put in an interest, not an application, but just I am interested.\nSpeaker 6: And then we will do that analysis between then and the 30th to say you either can move forward or not. And then after that, then they can apply and then stay through August. Then they have until August 1st to submit an application.\nSpeaker 6: Is that correct?\nSpeaker 4: That's what yes, that's what I'm thinking. As long as Public Works thinks they can comply with that.\nSpeaker 6: So I'll ask the team, is that a feasible timeline?\nSpeaker 8: Yes, that's reasonable.\nSpeaker 4: And what we will do is our business liaison, at least in District three, will notify all of our District three businesses that have parklets of the June 20th expression of interest timeline. But I'm hoping public works and work can work with the council offices on the others.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I hope all that comes from an Alan Mungo and then I'll queue up again.\nSpeaker 3: Councilman Allen. Okay. Thank you, Mayor. You ask a bunch of good questions. I am really concerned about this process and about if it's been really fair to these businesses after hearing some of the answers, you know, not contacting them and letting them know immediately that they that they didn't qualify, I think is concerning.\nSpeaker 3: So I really would like for all of those folks to be notified as soon as possible. As a former business owner myself, there are these folks are busy and we want to make sure that we are friendly and make as fair as possible.\nSpeaker 3: I do have one quick question and then I'll be done. But so the permanent process I know that you've for a parklets that we've had in place for many years. If that process is like this, where people go through a whole application process and they weren't they didn't qualify, I think that we have to look at that\nSpeaker 3: , too. I don't know if this process is any different, but if that is the case, we have to I think we have to step back and reevaluate the process and make sure it's fair for these businesses. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember, if I may respond to that. The permanent process has been in place for many years, like you mentioned. And this additional this is an additional step we've added for the benefit of the businesses. We didn't do a feasibility response prior to this.\nSpeaker 2: You basically had to invest about $2,000 in plans and permits, and then we would look at your proposal. This additional step is to help businesses so they don't have to make that initial investment and could come to us and say, Hey, I'm interested and we can take a, you know, a quick look at it and say not\nSpeaker 2: probably feasible because it's 40 miles an hour or not probably feasible because there's a line of sight issue or you're likely feasible. So you might want to make the investment because we don't see any initial problems. So it is a new step.\nSpeaker 2: It is intended to help the businesses and avoid them having to make an initial $2,000 investment.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Come on, man. Go.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I want to first thank everyone for showing up today. Whether you're a resident who lives next to a business or in a corridor, you made an investment in our community. We appreciate that. Same to the businesses.\nSpeaker 3: We know that it has been a tough go and taking a risk to become a business owner is a big expense and you're serving the community with the products and services that you provide, and that's important. I would like to say that.\nSpeaker 3: While I appreciate the staff and all the efforts you're making, it would be nice if there was a clear understanding of if you email this person, you will get a response within 24 hours of your feasible. I don't know if that's possible.\nSpeaker 3: I don't know if you want to announce an email address. I know that Councilman Price is offices. They will do that. I have significantly reduced number of copies in my district so I can just pick up the phone and call all of them.\nSpeaker 3: But it's a lot more in the third district, so I appreciate anything that you're able to do to simplify it and keep it in writing, because one of the things that's hard for us as councilmembers is the interpretation of what you think you're saying.\nSpeaker 3: And what they think they're hearing is not always congruent. And so we work really hard to make sure that it's in writing so that we as a council office can help step in and support and advocate for both the residents and the businesses.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, everyone, for your time.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I just have a couple more questions. So back to this. The just the question of interest from from restaurants and business owners. So would we consider we have as a city, I believe, sent in response to some folks that were interested in applying for the program, that we're not taking current applications, particularly around coastal issues\nSpeaker 7: . So someone that has sent that that inquiry and we responded and said that we're not taking applications. Would they would they so be considered some of the has interest. Or they've been removed from our interest category.\nSpeaker 8: Mr. Mayor, I believe that the instance that you're referring to actually was an email sent back in November of 21 where the situation was a little bit different than it is now, as we're having this entire discussion figure out, figuring out what we're going to do to move forward.\nSpeaker 8: You know, we we do address questions quickly, efficiently. And, you know, if we weren't kind of in this position where we have to not only do go through the permanent, permanent parklet process, but we also have to get a Coastal Commission approval, which adds another layer of complexity to all of this.\nSpeaker 8: So so as a result of waiting for what the outcome of this meeting is, we've kind of put a pause on some of those permits that are moving forward because we wanted to make sure we're making strides in the right direction.\nSpeaker 6: And answer the question. I think the answer is yes, we can consider them.\nSpeaker 7: And then 1/2, please, sir. What I wanted to also say, though, is that because I'm look, I have emails as of like two months ago where we're telling business owners that we're not taking. An application process and that at this time we're not accepting applications for permanent parklets or sidewalk dining within the coastal zone.\nSpeaker 7: And so I just want to make sure that if we sent folks an email like that. Have they been removed off the interest list?\nSpeaker 8: No, they have not been removed from the list.\nSpeaker 7: They would still be considered on the interest. Yes. Okay. That's good. That's that's good to know. And so then what it sounds like to me is I also want make sure because a lot of a lot of businesses are not going to read the newspaper tomorrow or know that, you know, they have a few days to still\nSpeaker 7: show interest or what the timeline processes are we going to proactively reach out to the businesses that have parklets?\nSpeaker 8: Well, we're going to reach out to the businesses that we know have interest. They've shown interest, and we'll talk to them and let them know if they do want to continue with the process, what those steps would be.\nSpeaker 8: And like I mentioned earlier, there is about four or five who already turned in plans. For whatever reason, they're incomplete.\nSpeaker 6: So we can get to the list of everyone who has it, because that's only going to capture people who already have interest. There may be some that have interest that have been discouraged or heard from someone else. So I'd like to get to everybody who has got a parklet and say you've got basically four days to email\nSpeaker 6: this email to say I have interest in continuing. Then we give them their answer ten days after that.\nSpeaker 7: That's great. And then I appreciate that. And then so. On. So if a restaurant has shown interest in the room or in the process, what is it that they have to do by August 1st, just so that I understand that as well, what is their requirement by August 1st.\nSpeaker 8: Where they're going to need to contact an engineer, a designer, to help develop a plan, maybe even if it's a high level plan, at least some sort of a drawing that shows what they're proposing. And then we can go out and do an evaluation to determine if it's going to be safe.\nSpeaker 8: Again, safety is my number one priority, and then we'll start the process to accumulate those businesses that need to go and get a Coastal Commission approval. And then we'll work together to walk through both of those steps, those processes.\nSpeaker 7: And then at the same time, the city will begin the process of contacting those businesses who are not in compliance, that are that have safety.\nSpeaker 8: Issues to fire them.\nSpeaker 7: Yes, there are traffic concerns to begin the removal of those and that would start within the next sounds like week or two, correct?\nSpeaker 8: Yes, that's correct.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Thank you so much, Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I've learned a whole lot about parklets. Many of the speeds up in up in my district are a little too fast. So we've done some curb extensions, we've done some sidewalk extensions and stuff to get some patio dining.\nSpeaker 1: But I've certainly learned a lot. I want to understand what we're voting on right now. So I think that will be important at the end. At the end of my comments, I want to first just acknowledge the person who said, hey, I know four or five of your districts don't have any, but imagine what it would be\nSpeaker 1: like if these were, you know, on your street. And that's what I can relate to because everyone understands what a nuisance is. I think that's something that's common and quality of life is something that we all care about.\nSpeaker 1: I would I would also say that, you know, typically you defer to council members to know and understand their local the dynamics of the local communities. And I that's something I try to always respect, but I want to thank everybody who's actually come out and talked to all of the council members about this specific issue.\nSpeaker 1: And I would encourage, like I've heard from many of the residents in this room about this specific issue to help educate me about it, I would encourage the restaurant groups to do the same. If you expect us to understand your perspective, you have to meet with all of us, because otherwise I you know, I'm going to row\nSpeaker 1: with the residents. If I don't understand what those perspectives are, I'll tell you. Additionally, I encourage better communication between all the parties. Here I It seems like you're making good progress from where it's where it's heading. The Mayor This motion is heading there was a seems like a larger group and then now there's a smaller group and\nSpeaker 1: then on the 20th and hopefully this motion will clarify this, there's an even smaller group of feasibility. So that definition is is narrowing. I think that also I think the mayor raised some really good points about if he's unclear and we don't haven't seen it in writing about the process.\nSpeaker 1: I think it's on us because it's so important to both sides that we see this process in writing, particularly after today, and that is communicated to that universe in writing. So we're all operating with the same set of facts moving forward because there were two accounts on whether or not we stood up a process for them or\nSpeaker 1: whether we didn't. And whenever there's a question like that, we have to err on the side of we need to do better generally. And so those are my observations from this discussion. You know, it was great to hear and to listen, but generally I just encourage better communication on the part of all the stakeholders so that we\nSpeaker 1: don't have to spend 3 hours on this next time. Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Any other council comment? So there's emotion and a second emotion. I think we've just repeated that we need more clarification or else or we'll sit there.\nSpeaker 6: I think we're good.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. A member who's gotten Castro votes.\nSpeaker 2: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Thank you. Next up is item 29.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Item 24 Report from Development Services Recommendation to receive and file the Green Terminal Island Transition Plan District seven.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. City, Assistant City Manager.\nSpeaker 6: Vice Mayor, members of the council. We have a staff report on this. This is an item that will be given by Angela Reynolds from Development Services.\nSpeaker 8: Oh. Good evening, Vice Mayor. Um, little history. The city accepted a planning grant from the Department of Transportation Caltrans on September 19th, 2013. The focus of the application was to prepare a concept plan for the potential decommissioning. Of the northern stretch of the Thai freeway, which.\nSpeaker 2: Is owned by.\nSpeaker 8: The city. From PCH to Willow Street, the grant is considered a social justice grant, which directly applies to addressing negative environmental impacts such as unhealthy air quality and noise from goods, movement and port operations on the west side of City of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 8: The Livable West Long Beach Plan was adopted by the City Council on several Tuesdays ago. One of the projects in the plan was to potentially decommission the TII freeway from PCH to Willow. The primary goal of the plan of this particular plan that we're presenting tonight, the green tie, is to provide a buffer between schools and neighborhoods\nSpeaker 8: on the east side of the Ty Freeway from.\nSpeaker 12: The heavy.\nSpeaker 8: Industry on the west side. The consultant, which is Melinda is and I'll introduce Melanie in a moment. And staff did a very robust community stakeholder outreach for this item. The outreach included small community and neighborhood focus groups, three or four large city.\nSpeaker 12: And.\nSpeaker 8: Community and stakeholder workshops, discussions with environmental groups, and also discussions with an assortment of goods, movement stakeholders in and around the port area in regards to good in regard to goods movement. We were able to reach Harbor Trucking, West Coast Marine Terminal Operations, Union Pacific, the Future Ports Group, which quite a few goods movement folks attend Tesoro\nSpeaker 8: , Calle Cartage, Three Rivers, Nova, L.A., Grain, Watson Land and Fast Lane and the Wilmington Chamber of Commerce at their request. If this plan was to move forward, there will be many next steps to achieve it. The implementation chapter of the plan lays out a likely seven year project timeline from inception.\nSpeaker 8: To build out. The first and most important step in this process would be for the City Council to receive and file the concept plan and then direct staff, including development services, public works, Parks, Rec and Marine and the Harbor Department, to proceed with more study and investigation of the feasibility of this project.\nSpeaker 8: At this time, there is no identified funding to start the process. The presentation tonight will discuss those next steps a little bit more in-depth, including design, environmental documents, secure NEPA and continued community outreach. So with that, I'm going to introduce Melanie Smith from Melendez, and she'll go through a brief PowerPoint presentation.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Angela. Thank you for having us here tonight to talk about the Green Tea Project. It's been an honor to lead the team through what's been just about a year long process to take very, very first steps toward a project that could have really great implications for the city.\nSpeaker 8: As Angela has already said, this was funded by a Caltrans environmental justice grant and supported by the the city and put forward by the city and supported by the port of Long Beach. So we start by asking ourselves, what is this?\nSpeaker 8: What is this project rooted in? And it's really rooted in City of Long Beach Mobility Element Policy The Mobility Olmec calls for deep free weighing the city owned segment of the Terminal Island Freeway. Again, we're not talking about the whole freeway.\nSpeaker 8: We're talking about the city owned segment of it ending the truck route that exists today at PCH. So that would be the furthest point that it would go on to the north and that would have the result of shifting truck traffic that exists today on that segment to other routes, including potentially Alameda Street, which is also an\nSpeaker 8: available corridor. So again, this is a first step in a long process. We'll talk about how other cities are taking a look at their infrastructure and reevaluating it really as a benefit to provide different benefits to the city.\nSpeaker 8: So again, why are we looking at this segment of the city? We know that the tie we'll look at it on the map in a second and it's, you know, the western edge of the city. And this is an apart the study area that we're talking about.\nSpeaker 8: City is really part of the city that has suffered really from a number of difficult existing conditions. So it really outstrips the rest of the city in L.A. County, by far in particulate matter and fine particles per square mile, it has a higher level of asthma rates than either the rest of the city or the county as\nSpeaker 8: a whole. And so and these are just like two statistics that I picked. We could look at, you know, other disparities in this part of the city. I think we were all quite familiar with the challenges that West Long Beach faces.\nSpeaker 8: So again, why do cities look look at this or why is this city looking at this? In addition to it being rooted in its adopted policy, you know, cities across the U.S. and really around the globe are taking a look at what is really being known as freeway freeway removal and looking at ways in which to consider\nSpeaker 8: their existing infrastructure, reconsider it as a community benefit. And just one example. Pretty well known around the country, the example of Portland's Harbor Drive. You know, this is a facility that is far more intense in terms of a traffic artery than what we're talking about in terms of the segment of the TII.\nSpeaker 8: This is what it looked like before. This is what it has become. And the city really had a different vision for what this how this could function as a community benefit and what has become a destination, really, and a well known facet of the community and a destination within it.\nSpeaker 8: So, again, what are we specifically talking about here in this project, in this very first step and very conceptual look at this, where we're talking about a segment of of the right of way, again, north of PCH and really north of the Cloverleaf that existed at at PCH.\nSpeaker 8: Those are controlled by Caltrans. So we're looking at the right of way north of that to Willow. We'll look at other maps that show that we're talking about an area of about 25 acres. So on this map, you can see Willow Street to the north, PCH to the south.\nSpeaker 8: But again, we're really talking about the area north of the Cole Relief's, north of PCH. And what we really notice when we look at an aerial is this contrast right in the land use pattern west of the Thai freeway versus east of the Thai freeway.\nSpeaker 8: We're looking at really a very industrial industrialized area there, just beyond the edge of the city with the refineries, other industrial facilities and the rail yards directly adjacent to the western edge of the city. And the uses then that we see in.\nSpeaker 8: Contrast to the east of that are really very residential in nature. So we've got century villages of Korea housing a really facility there with with a community living there, career high school to the north of that read, Hudson Park and Hudson Elementary and then other Long Beach Unified Land and just some snaps of the of the site\nSpeaker 8: adjacencies which I'm sure we're all familiar with the community gardens at Hudson looking to the West, the buffer that has been developed recently adjacent to villages of Cabrillo, really that was early days in that buffer. And it's it's some of its outdoor equipment areas, fitness zones of you looking down Hill Street to the west and where it\nSpeaker 8: terminates currently and does not really connect to the Tai and Hudson Park itself. So, you know, again, even at this very early stage where we have not done a traffic study, we have not done technical analysis yet, that would be something that would be done in the future.\nSpeaker 8: We have taken a just a look, a very high level look at existing conditions. And again, I was talking about other arteries that have really changed in other parts of the world, in the country and really much higher volume facilities.\nSpeaker 8: We're talking about a a segment of the freeway, really, and this is just depicting existing volumes that it carries about 11,000 vehicles a day and about half those are trucks. So about 6000 ish trucks per day, higher volume north and south.\nSpeaker 8: And we can see that PCH, it's a little difficult to see sorry on this, but PCH being a much higher volume east West Street even then, Willow Sepulveda to the north. But obviously, traffic is something that would have to be considered and studied in much greater detail at this project were to move forward.\nSpeaker 8: Also, certainly as as we know, we're talking about a segment of the Terminal Island Freeway. You can see it in blue there with the logo tie next to it. And we're certainly aware of the network of truck routes that exist in the area that serve the port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles as well\nSpeaker 8: . And so what we're depicting here are the state overweight routes, the Long Beach designated overweight truck routes and other jurisdictions overweight routes as well, and freeways. And so you can see that that this segment of the Thai is currently a locally designated overweight route.\nSpeaker 8: So that's another consideration and another area that would certainly have to be studied if the project were to move forward. So in terms of project process, as we mentioned, there were four major convenings as part of this project.\nSpeaker 8: This is about developing a community vision, high level community vision for the facility. So we so starting last year, we were able to convene the community in a large way and we'll talk about that briefly. But we first really asked the community, what are your top priorities for greening the TY?\nSpeaker 8: And number one, really was providing environmental benefits to the communities that the space needed to work to provide positive benefits and not then cause unintended spillover traffic into the neighborhood and introduce new linkages for pedestrians and cyclists. And you'll see those themes come up again and again in the outreach that we've done.\nSpeaker 8: But we didn't just limit the outreach in this project to large community convenings, though those were really a large requirement of the grant. So we did reach out to environmental justice stakeholders and as you can see, a very large number of community groups in drop ins to their their meetings as well as inviting them to the larger\nSpeaker 8: convenings. But we also engage the good movement industry and other government agencies, utilities and then specific T.I adjacent trucking companies, businesses that would be impacted by this just to get their initial take on what the issues were so that we could document those should the project project move forward.\nSpeaker 8: There were additional things that would need to be studied. And just to wrap up about outreach, we celebrated the conclusion of the project process with an actual Open Streets event on Hill Street and again showed folks conceptual designs.\nSpeaker 8: Ask them to give us input about really what were the things that were most important to them. So we asked them a few times during the process pedestrian and bicycle facilities at the top and a planted buffer urban forest came in a close second.\nSpeaker 8: This was about 86. 87 people provided us with comments. It was a well-attended event as really all of them were. I mean, you can see nature, plan, play, wetland, water cleansing area, native education gardens were the top five of interest to folks.\nSpeaker 8: So as a result of of this initial work on this project, we have come up with a conceptual design concept. This is the illustrative of that. You can we've been looking north on all of the other graphics, but we're looking west so that the south is to the to the left.\nSpeaker 8: North is to the right in this view. And you can see that the view is dominated by planted buffer. The dark green area to the west is really that buffer, other native gardens and then road facility, a local road facility through the through the the space that could be a mirror and ring road that could help us\nSpeaker 8: to slow traffic, keep folks safe while they're in the space, but also provide eyes on places for folks to park. And then a connection that could be made at Hill Street in the center of the space as well.\nSpeaker 8: And and some of the active uses that were of interest to the community, like a skate area or a plaza gathering area, could be located there adjacent to the schools and really accessible by the kids. So just to conclude a few views that we did of the conceptual design, this is at 20th Street, an entrance that would\nSpeaker 8: be sort of north of the existing cloverleaf. So looking north and you can see the real focus of passive open space, the buffer to the west, areas in which we could capture water, cleanse it, handle stormwater, which is a significant issue on the west side as well.\nSpeaker 8: And you can see the the road access area, the parking and the the broad areas for folks to access and promenade on pedestrians and bikes. And this is looking at Hill Street, we're looking to the East and Hill Street is coming into the space again, connecting for vehicles, but also for pedestrians and bikes.\nSpeaker 8: And these are some of the play areas that we're envisioning, again, adjacent, accessible to the schools, areas for the community to use. And then for the north of the park, looking south near Willow Street, again, just areas for folks to use and enjoy in sort of passive ways.\nSpeaker 8: And with that that strong open space buffer to the west beyond the roadway so that we can get get some great use. But but also separation, appropriate separation for safety and and for keeping folks safe in this in this space.\nSpeaker 8: So that is where the concept ended up as as a result of this process, clearly a very first step in in one of many that would have to be taken. And so in the implementation chapter of the of the study, we talk about next steps and we identify really that should the council recommend this were to go\nSpeaker 8: forward. The very first step would be to work with Los Angeles, Carson and the ports to develop a plan for goods movement. So we understand the importance of that and certainly the city is aware of that. And so there would need to be direct, direct consultation about that with with many stakeholders, additional outreach, with stakeholders, further design\nSpeaker 8: , detailed design to get you to a more detailed level of design and start to consider operations, governance and and further funding analysis as well. An environmental review review would obviously be required and extensive likely. And so we've certainly identified that as starting a beyond year one and then really identifying a 3 to 7 year process, assuming it\nSpeaker 8: all really went forward stepwise and addressing funding operations and governance, design, implementation and maintenance. So that I think gives you an idea of where we've been in this project, and we look forward to your questions.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. Councilmember Gonzalez. Actually, let me go to the maker of the Motion Councilmember Your Honor.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. So, as we can see, over a year ago, we initiated this process of going to the community of West Long Beach. Which this project takes most of the the space out there. And we ask the question.\nSpeaker 2: If the Thai freeway were to be decommissioned between PCH and Willow Street, which becomes supported. What would you like to see there? And so there was a series of scoping meetings that were held at Admiral Kidd Park with a combination exercise or event and Hudson Park.\nSpeaker 2: Where some conceptual. Conceptual plans were developed about what the community would like to see if it were decommissioned. So where we're at today is that this is just a conceptual study as to what we would like to see if it were decommissioned.\nSpeaker 2: It's a conceptual plan that addresses many of the issues that are that West Bromwich residents face and that many of us take for granted in other parts of the city. We want clean air. We want better mobility. We want our schools to be clean.\nSpeaker 2: What are schools to be safe when kids go outside and play? We want to lower particulate matter. We want green space, more trees, bicycle lanes, people or passive parks where people can walk, walk through, maybe even with some exercise areas.\nSpeaker 2: And there's also a plan which surprises me. Also maybe creating a wetlands area as well, which is awesome. I mean, it's just a comprehensive conceptual plan that would address many of the concerns that the residents have who live in West Palm Beach and who abut the freeway.\nSpeaker 2: Now, having heard the presentation right now there is there are a lot of questions about mobility in terms of transportation. Where are those trucks going to go? What's the connection going to be? Where trucks near the port and heading north into the rail yards or into the other storage facilities and up the Alameda corridor?\nSpeaker 2: How do we manage that? There are questions to be asked. So at this point, I'm going to to stop before I make my motion. But I would like to hear, obviously, from from for those who have an interest in this in this item here to hear their viewpoint.\nSpeaker 2: And if we can bring the discussion back and listen, my councilmembers would like to make their points known at that. That's certainly up to you.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Andrews, would you like to address the motion? Okay. So your request, Councilmember Urunga, is to hear from the public. Okay. Council members is that. Is that agreeable? Thank you. At this time, we'd like to hear from members of the public that wish to address the Council on item 24 relating to the Terminal Island Transition Plan.\nSpeaker 0: Please come forward.\nSpeaker 2: All right. We're baby.\nSpeaker 8: Sitters. We were waiting for the timer. There we.\nSpeaker 2: Go.\nSpeaker 8: All right. Good evening. Good evening, vice mayor and honorable council members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak again this evening. My name is Elizabeth Horn. I'm the executive director of Future Ports, and I'm here this evening not only representing future ports.\nSpeaker 10: But also.\nSpeaker 8: A historic coalition of labor, trades and business organizations here to express our concerns and and opposition to the decommissioning of the Terminal Island Freeway. Many of them are here tonight and will also be speaking in the history of the ports.\nSpeaker 8: As far as we can determine, this coalition has never happened before. So we are very, very concerned about this. Earlier I sent a to get to each of you. Hopefully it's been distributed some letters, one from Senator Isidor Hull's office and then also our coalition letter.\nSpeaker 8: One additional point that's not in the letter that I'd like to make is that even though that other freeways that have more traffic volumes have been decommissioned, as we saw in the presentation, none of them have been running through a port complex like we have here in Long Beach in the San Pedro ports.\nSpeaker 8: It's the largest port complex in the Western Hemisphere, not just in the United States. This is North America, South America combined. So comparing our Terminal Island Freeway project to other projects, we feel is more like comparing apples and oranges and not really relevant to in this case.\nSpeaker 8: So as we've mentioned, the Thai freeway is a state designated overweight corridor. The trucks would be diverted from the freeway to surface streets not combined and not designed for those trucks. One of the points that we'd also like to make is that with those 6000 trucks that we heard that would be diverted to those surface streets.\nSpeaker 8: Those are overweight trucks now that those would be regular trucks and not for overweight. The one truck would have to now make two trips. So the 6000 trucks would probably be more likely like ten or 11,000 trucks in realistic.\nSpeaker 8: So we want to make sure that we're familiar with what would happen to all those trucks. We do believe that a full environmental impact report should be performed if the city chooses to pursue the decommissioning. We are confident that the air would show that this freeway would result in rerouting traffic to surface streets throughout throughout the community\nSpeaker 8: and intensifying traffic already at those places. So we don't think this is a very well thought out plan. We'd like to see it go back to the drawing board with an in-depth traffic analysis and environmental review if it's going to move forward at all, which.\nSpeaker 0: We hope it will.\nSpeaker 8: Not. So thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 13: Good evening, Vice Mayor Lowenthal and council members. My name is Floyd Bryan. I'm with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Southern California District Council. And we are.\nSpeaker 11: Opposed to this. Our closure for a number of reasons. And one of the main ones that I, I, I have trouble with is that.\nSpeaker 13: They say that there was so much outreach, community outreach. And I believe I asked Councilman Aranda how many people were in this district, and he told me 50,000. And about 50,281 people attended.\nSpeaker 11: If you add all four meetings together and some of those people had.\nSpeaker 13: Been to two or three meetings, so that 281 is a very, very small percentage of the people in the area.\nSpeaker 11: And I have worked many years last 15, as a matter of fact, on environmental projects to make the port greener. This project is not going to necessarily make the port greener. You take those trucks are not going to go away.\nSpeaker 11: They're going to be moved into a.\nSpeaker 13: Non-Free away situation where they're going to be traveling on surface streets. And anybody who's done anything on the environmental end of this with truck movement knows that idling trucks are slow moving trucks, double and triple. It's exponential. It isn't just an arithmetic.\nSpeaker 11: Addition of particulate.\nSpeaker 13: Matter and the particulate matter that they listed in 2011 has come down since then. In that area, we've worked real hard to bring that down, and we've got we're still working hard. But when I went to two of the presentations and we've written letters to you at their presentations, they weren't open to any suggestions.\nSpeaker 13: We have some alternatives that we'd like to discuss. I mentioned Councilwoman Gonzalez. There are alternatives to this closure and or there are alternatives before this closure that aren't brought up at all. And to do this without.\nSpeaker 11: An E.R. is.\nSpeaker 13: As far as we're concerned, pretty much, you know, unconscionable, really, because you're moving the stuff, you're moving the particulate matter, but you're not going to make it better. That's the problem. E.R. would show that, you know, there's no reason not to have an area that we can think of, you know, other than the fact.\nSpeaker 11: That so, you know, push this through.\nSpeaker 13: And, you know, we're we're against it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. My name is Giselle Fong and I am a resident of the seventh District. I am chair of the Environmental Health Workgroup of Building Healthy Communities Long Beach, and I'm also a City Commissioner with the Board of Health and Human Services.\nSpeaker 4: I'm here to tell you that we sent a letter to your offices through email so that you can reference that for more detail. But I just wanted to go through some of the main points of that letter, and that is to voice our support for the Green Tea Project, mostly because of its health benefits.\nSpeaker 4: So you saw from the presentations that the residents that are adjacent to freeways and to the big industrial facilities such as the ports, the freeways, refineries are in in full and direct contact with the highest levels of particulate matter in our city.\nSpeaker 4: And we know all of the severe health impacts that that entails. We believe strongly that the Green Tea Project will create a health protective buffer for especially those residents that are directly on the fence line communities including students at Cabrillo, students at Stevens Mills Middle School, the all of the residents that enjoy the facilities at Hudson Park\nSpeaker 4: . So we we do believe that there is an extreme health benefit for this green tea project. We also believe that the the truck traffic can can be with planning, with strategic planning to be diverted to the Alameda Corridor, which was intended for the movement of freight as a freight corridor.\nSpeaker 4: We also just wanted to say that this is an area of the city that is very underserved. The West Long Beach has one acre of open space per 1000 people versus the east side of Long Beach, which has 16 acres of per 100,000 people.\nSpeaker 4: And so we do feel like this is an important community benefit for the west side of Long Beach. And lastly, I'll just wrap up that we did really appreciate the process that the meaningful community participation process where residents were asked and were given the opportunity division, what we wanted for our city, including the types of health and\nSpeaker 4: health benefits, the types of amenities that we wanted for our city. And we would encourage that the Council to support this project moving forward and to include meaningful community participation as we move forward. And we support the community.\nSpeaker 4: The City Council to approve the green tie plan going forward and that we ask you to to direct staff to pursue next steps, including environmental analysis and identifying funding sources. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening, Honorable Vice Mayor and council members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening. My name is Mike Williams and I am the California executive director of government relations for the International Warehouse Logistics Association. I am here tonight representing a unprecedented coalition of labor, trade and business organizations to express our deep concerns and opposition to\nSpeaker 11: the decommissioning of the Terminal Island Freeway. We have five local unions, two trade unions and one business organization together as one coalition unified in opposition to this project. Our association has been around since 1891 and this is the first time that the labor unions have jointly signed on to a coalition letter.\nSpeaker 11: This indicates the significance of the concern that we have as stakeholders in the community and in the warehouse logistics industry. We have raised many points of concern about the proposal. In our opposition letter one The Thai freeway is a state designed overweight corridor.\nSpeaker 11: Trucks would be diverted from the freeway to surface streets not designated for those trucks or the loads would have to be split and more trucks dispatched to keep within the legal weight requirement leading to increased truck traffic. Alameda and Anaheim Streets and PCH would suffer tremendous congestion due to the influx of those and other trucks on those\nSpeaker 11: streets and exacerbation of noise and air pollution. We had Melanie Smith provide a presentation on September 17, 2015 to our members that provided more questions and relatively no answers. You saw that presentation. Today was the same when we were presented.\nSpeaker 11: Some of the questions raised included who would provide the billions in funding that may be required for the project? Is there an ETA for an air or traffic study or would the surface street traffic be diverted? Uh, has this been thought through?\nSpeaker 11: When we would win. Would this go to vote, which is happening today? Possibly. But essentially, many questions were posed. Another important issue to consider. Is this a conflict of interest to have the former Long Beach city planner from 2014, the commissioner, her architectural firm, awarded the contract?\nSpeaker 11: Were there any other groups that were considered? On page 72 of the city background materials what is being exempted under sequel? Does tonight's action exempt the project from Sequel altogether? So in conclusion, we would like to request an opportunity to have a full on workshop with a small group of representations, representatives from Labor and business to seriously\nSpeaker 11: look at alternatives to decommissioning the freeway. We think that we can look at a real solution and come up with compromises to achieve the goals of everyone efficient goods movement, better neighborhoods, equal economic prosperity and environmental improvements for everyone.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, council members. Vice Mayor My name's Joseph Sullivan. I work for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 11 in the National Electrical Contractors Association of Greater Los Angeles. And I'm here to express our opposition to the decommissioning of the freeway.\nSpeaker 6: Our contractors and electricians are doing a lot of work at the ports, electrifying the ports, making the ports more green, work on projects like LED lighting, retrofit solar projects, solutions for idling ships. And there's more work coming around microgrids, energy storage and resiliency.\nSpeaker 6: And these are good jobs. They're local jobs. They're going to local businesses. There's a project labor agreement for the Middle Harbor that requires local residents complete work on these projects. One out of every eight jobs in Long Beach is related to the port.\nSpeaker 6: And so the port has a really important job engine and it's really important to our electricians and our contractors and the ports and the surrounding areas are being are becoming greener. We know that from studies, and we're working on these projects.\nSpeaker 6: Our apprenticeship program. The contractors and Labor are spending millions of dollars to prepare our workers to do this work. But removing critical infrastructure is not a viable solution. It's a wrong decision. One, it hurts competitiveness. Other ports would gladly take this cargo.\nSpeaker 6: And due to changes to the Panama Canal, they're becoming more competitive to do so. Ships are bigger. We're going to see larger bottlenecks. And what we're going to see is reduced productivity. And with reduced productivity, we're going to see less infrastructure projects, which is going to mean less greening of the ports.\nSpeaker 6: Right now, we're seeing terminal operators invest in greening their their areas. It's been mentioned. Where will this traffic go? It's going to go to surface streets. Do we know the air is going to become cleaner? We don't. It this you know, this is a little bit like moving homeless people out of a homeless shelter.\nSpeaker 6: It doesn't cure the homelessness problem. It just puts them in a worse position in some other area. And that's what we're doing with this cargo. So in closing, I'd like to say we're in the middle of an energy revolution, a technology revolution, and we're seeing new solutions all the time around, battery storage for electric vehicles, around fuel\nSpeaker 6: cells, natural gas solutions. And just closing a freeway is not. That's lazy thinking. There's other approaches and other solutions that are much more viable. It will create jobs and help this area to continue to thrive.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Alison Gallagher here on behalf of Assembly Member O'Donnell. I join others here today with several concerns pertaining to this project, including the outreach for this project has been limited, although it's been stated that there have been several community meetings and forums for stakeholder input.\nSpeaker 4: Neighboring cities such as Wilmington and Carson have not been included on this project. As the Assembly member representing the harbor area and both ports, I want to ensure that we are including our regional and industry partners. In addition to the immediate communities surrounding the TY Freeway, we have not fully discussed all of the burdens that will be\nSpeaker 4: placed on the community communities surrounding the freeway. Further study is needed to ensure the continuity of the port's ability to move goods efficiently and timely. We need to ensure that other heavy weight corridors exist, and we need to ensure that clear route alternatives are in place to prevent truck traffic from going through our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 4: And also an environmental impact report should be conducted as well as transportation and economic impacts should be explored as well. I urge you to consider these concerns before moving forward with this project. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Vice Mayor Council members Pilar Arroyo with Watson Lane Company. Art Company's name was listed as one of those who had participated in the outreach. I've asked the city clerk to distribute a map for you because I think a picture is worth a thousand words.\nSpeaker 8: The comments made by a number of the speakers expressing concern about this project, I did show them so I won't repeat them. When you look at this map, those areas outlined in yellow are Watson land companies, existing master plan industrial centers.\nSpeaker 8: It represents about 12 million square feet of industrial space. Been with the company almost 30 years. Most of this space is port related. I also serve on the California Straight State Freight Advisory Commission that has been a Caltrans led program to look at the importance of of goods, movement, infrastructure.\nSpeaker 8: I think you are probably very familiar with that. And to have this concept and I understand recognized and it's been said over and over again that this is just a concept. But I want you to think about the unintended implications, the serious implications and messages that this sends to potential customers.\nSpeaker 8: Previous speakers have talked about competitiveness. What about the competitiveness of being able to attract? Customers that bring their goods through this port or other ports when they don't know if they're going to have that Terminal Island free way.\nSpeaker 8: And it's not only about the overweight corridor, I might add. It's about the time inefficiency. And when you close down this major infrastructure or even send a message that you're considering doing it. Those start to impact decisions. And those decisions have serious implications in terms of jobs.\nSpeaker 8: So we have to think. Brodeur and not look at a conceptual project that, sure, how can anybody be opposed to something as beautiful as those renderings? The process has been really quite incredible. We in I personally helped with assembling a number of our customers to the meetings and the feedback we got back, and I didn't hear a\nSpeaker 8: word about the concerns that were raised. Serious concerns. Those customers are the employers. And like me, a Long Beach resident crosses that city boundary to work in Carson. So this is a huge, huge issue. And I ask that you take time to do this right, to not move in a direction that has unintended consequences.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 13: Good evening, everybody. Vice Mayor Lowenthal, members of the city council. My name is West in the bar. I represent several organizations that are opposed to the current the current project that is being proposed or concept, including the Harbor Trucking Association, Foreign Trade Association, South Bay Association of Chambers of Commerce.\nSpeaker 13: I'm also a Long Beach resident, very active in my community and very proud of Long Beach. And I think it's important that we don't cut off our nose to spite our face here. I'm not going to complain about the issues or raise more issues, but more talk about things that can be done so we can move forward\nSpeaker 13: to try to identify solutions, one of which is we need to identify other infrastructure projects that could replace the freeway moving forward. And it needs to be done in a meaningful way in a meeting and in concert with this, looking at this as well, because we need to make sure that we are not going to move forward\nSpeaker 13: with something while we don't have the funding or ability to put something in its place that could actually be better for both the community and for our goods movement industry. I think that's the first thing that's important, and the only way that we can do that is by looking at one, a complete traffic study from a regional\nSpeaker 13: analysis. That would be part of a secret process as well as a full environmental impact report to see what the consequences or unintended consequences of moving cargo and freight to other, more seriously impacted traffic. Intersections in the region are at a point in time when in California and I have testified multiple times in front of state, state\nSpeaker 13: assembly and Senate committees on infrastructure, on on ports and good movement, when we're looking at how to reduce bottlenecks and invest in infrastructure in a way that we can create efficiencies that reduce air emissions. I think it's important that we take that to heart here locally as well.\nSpeaker 13: Long Beach is home to the green port and we need to understand that that means moving a lot of cargo in an environmentally friendly way. What we need to do is take a look at how can we move this cargo in a way that may be quicker and does not impact the community in a negative way and\nSpeaker 13: identify each of those alternatives. I do have one question for this evening, though, and that's really within the entire packet. There is a negative declaration in that packet. And one of the big concerns we have moving forward with just a receiving file would be does that negative declaration that was filed in January of 2015 show as some\nSpeaker 13: sort of secret exemption for moving forward with this project? I think if if the project moves forward in any way, shape or form, there are certain studies, a complete air regional traffic study and also goods movement alternatives that be considered with it.\nSpeaker 13: And thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 1: But even in Vice Mayor, City Council members.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening. My name's Stellar Sewer District two resident.\nSpeaker 1: I'm also with Green Education.\nSpeaker 8: And the chair for the Building Healthy Communities Neighborhoods Work Group. I was fortunate to attend the groundbreaking Today at the Future DeForest Wetlands in North Long Beach. Really exciting project. There were so many residents, community groups, local representatives that had been fighting for over the past ten years to bring this wetlands project to fruition.\nSpeaker 8: Their community, they were committed to creating more green space, more green open space for their families, for their community, for recreation and exercise, to enjoy nature.\nSpeaker 1: And to help.\nSpeaker 8: Mitigate the high levels of pollution in their neighborhoods. I attended this event not just as a Parks and Recreation Commissioner, but as a Long Beach resident that bought her first home right down the street that enjoyed the Forest Park for many years.\nSpeaker 8: And as someone that walked those trails and wondered when the area would be cleaned up and made safe for everyone, just like the divorce wetlands effort, community members in West Long Beach, where Green Open Park space ranges from only one acre per 1000 residents, compared to over 16 acres per 1000 in the east district have been looking\nSpeaker 8: forward to the day when they too can enjoy additional park space and less pollution in their neighborhoods. Having attended several of the visioning sessions for West Long Beach Livability Livability Plan, I heard extremely creative and forward thinking ideas from community members to include in this project things like an urban forest, wetlands, meadows, pedestrian bike paths, native gardens\nSpeaker 8: and nature and skate areas. The open space element of our general plan states that the city should be establishing open space buffers between vulnerable populations and manmade and natural hazards, including those emitting toxic pollution. The decommissioning of the tree freeway and the creation of this park would be a huge step in achieving this goal and would serve\nSpeaker 8: a higher and greater use for the public as open space. And the green tea would be a huge statement to our underserved, pollution burdened communities that the city and our elected officials are committed committed to creating, healthy, engaging and state of the art, green spaces and parks for all of our restaurants.\nSpeaker 8: Finally, I leave you with this from the National Recreation and Parks Association regarding parks and social equity in our communities. It is a right, not just a privilege for people nationwide to have safe, healthful access to parks and recreation.\nSpeaker 8: Because of this, people connect with one another, build bonds that last a lifetime. Places transform into destinations with influx of new businesses and local economies flourish. Parks and recreation. Truly built communities. Communities for all. So I ask for your support for the.\nSpeaker 1: Green Tea Transition.\nSpeaker 8: Plan.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening. Vice Mayor Lowenthal City Council Member.\nSpeaker 13: City Staff My name is Brian D'Andrea, president of Century Villages at Cabrillo.\nSpeaker 11: As many of you know, CBC is the nonprofit that is the owner, developer.\nSpeaker 13: Manager and steward of the 27 acre villages at Cabrillo Community in West Long Beach were home to more than 1300 residents, including more than 550 veterans. Very pleased to report that we've recently conducted a grand opening for our Cabrillo Gateway Development and have recently broken ground on our anchor place development.\nSpeaker 13: Those two developments combined will add another 200 permanent supportive homes for homeless households in Long Beach. So we're very excited about that. The secret of our success over the years and it's been nearly 20 years that we've been at it, resides in this growing collaboration of organizations and government agencies that that play a role in helping us\nSpeaker 13: to restore health and address our homeless crisis. And really, at the heart of that collaboration is the city of Long Beach, which is the true backbone to our efforts at the villages and much beyond in the larger community.\nSpeaker 13: Over the years, the city has invested extensive resources at the villages, including more than $16 million of capital project base rental support and extensive support of service funding through its continuum of care grant through the Department of Health and Human Services to support the larger mission that we're attempting to achieve.\nSpeaker 13: The Villages is located.\nSpeaker 11: Directly adjacent to the TII freeway.\nSpeaker 13: Where a neighbor to the freeway and we're also home to a highly vulnerable population homeless, veterans, children, families victimized by violence, persons suffering from mental and physical ailments. And many of our residents have respiratory illness. These conditions are exacerbated by the reality of our location next to freeways, the ports refinery and the extensive manufacturing base and in\nSpeaker 13: and around West Long Beach. And over the years, we worked really hard to help mitigate those impacts. Thanks to funding from the Port of Long Beach under its Community Mitigation Grants program, we've developed a 303 hundred tree urban forest that the western perimeter of our campus actually on a piece of land that was leased on a long\nSpeaker 13: term, long term basis from the city of Long Beach itself. The land separates our community from the TI Freeway and has been transformed into an urban green space that sequesters carbon dioxide, scrubs the air of harmful particulates, beautifies the area and provides passive recreational opportunities for our residents.\nSpeaker 13: And while that urban forest is a great amenity and has been a great success, it's only the beginning and it's only a piece of the puzzle. We're very encouraged by the Green Tea Plan that's before you tonight, and we'd like to commend city staff, its consultants and the many community stakeholders on both sides of this debate.\nSpeaker 11: That have participated in what we believe is a very collaborative process. We think the result.\nSpeaker 13: Is an incredibly thoughtful plan, one that will help to further mitigate the health and environmental impacts on the west side of Long Beach and ultimately improve quality of life for all of our residents within the city. And so this evening, we encourage the council to receive and file the plan and to concurrently define a road map for\nSpeaker 13: implementing that plan down the road.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Brian.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council members.\nSpeaker 1: City staff. Melanie. Hi. My name is Mona Eichner. And excuse.\nSpeaker 10: Me.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a sixth district rep. Sorry. My address is on file and I'm a member of the.\nSpeaker 1: I do live in the sixth district.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a founding member of the Wrigley. Wrigley is going green and the Wrigley Clean team, which.\nSpeaker 1: Actually makes the green tie kind of right up.\nSpeaker 4: The alley. And of all the things that I'm.\nSpeaker 1: Involved with in the city.\nSpeaker 4: Who wouldn't want I mean, as a Wrigley is going green member, why wouldn't I.\nSpeaker 0: Want to green.\nSpeaker 1: The Terminal Island Freeway?\nSpeaker 4: Why wouldn't I want more trees in the park on the west side, which we are so lacking over here? But I actually am also now the sixth district representative of the Pedestrian Safety Advisory Committee.\nSpeaker 1: And although I'm not speaking on behalf of the committee as.\nSpeaker 4: That member, I'm more interested in the pedestrian safety aspects of.\nSpeaker 2: The.\nSpeaker 1: Greening that.\nSpeaker 4: The tie. And I'd like to actually reiterate some of the points I made in my.\nSpeaker 1: Letter that I sent to you guys. And so.\nSpeaker 4: I just wanted to remind you that the Green bill would replace.\nSpeaker 8: When it replaces the to freeway would be.\nSpeaker 1: Directly would address as was shown on the map would directly about the Elizabeth Hudson Elementary School and read in Cabrillo High schools and also it's near Garfield Elementary School and.\nSpeaker 0: Stephen Middle School.\nSpeaker 1: Since the gentleman.\nSpeaker 4: Before me was.\nSpeaker 8: Representing the villages of.\nSpeaker 1: Cabrillo. The students that live there have to the the paths that they go to get to school is are so connected that they they can walk up to.\nSpeaker 10: A mile or a mile and a half to get to school.\nSpeaker 4: And with the addition of this greenbelt and walkways and bike paths, that distance can be shortened up to.\nSpeaker 1: Two thirds of that. And that would be pretty incredible.\nSpeaker 4: And some students are forced to walk on PCH.\nSpeaker 1: And as we all know, that's a truck route. It's not a good place to be walking. The mobility plan, the Long Beach Mobility Point Plan has the goal of reducing conflicts between free movement and active transportation. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 1: And greening the tie will shift trucks away from the schools, while will.\nSpeaker 4: Hopefully the studies will prove that. But.\nSpeaker 1: It will reduce the need for students and pedestrians to be on PCH. And also traffic will be eliminated near some of the schools off of Santa Fe. And it's just going to be a good thing for schools. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 1: I'm really nervous.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm pretty much finished. And I really do want you all to support the green tea as I support the green tea and leaves holding a sign that says Go green or go home. And that's how I feel too.\nSpeaker 4: Thanks. Good evening, Vice Mayor and council members. My name is Katie Rispoli. I'm the executive director of We Are the Next, a nonprofit organization based here in downtown Long Beach and serving the Los Angeles region. And I mean, if only it were so easy that we could vote tonight and a project like this and tomorrow start working\nSpeaker 4: to create this great green space. That would be fantastic. But that's not what we're asking for. I support this project, and what's being asked for this evening is to approve and file the Green Terminal Island Transition Plan. And that plan will put into process as all of these things that the opposition here tonight has been asking for\nSpeaker 4: , looking into traffic considerations, environmental considerations, long term impacts of this project and actually putting into place this permanent plan in order to make it happen. This is not a short term process. This is a seven year minimum process.\nSpeaker 4: Getting to a point where we're actually looking at breaking ground on a project like this. And that's not just seven years where we're waiting and working on this. That's seven years where there is consistent pollution on the Terminal Island Freeway.\nSpeaker 4: Seven years where that has memory is more than twice what it is in the county as a whole and seven years where residents in West Long Beach are not feeling invested in by the city. And if there's anything that we know for a fact, it's that when you feel invested in in your home and when you have\nSpeaker 4: a supportive environment, as you're growing up, you have faith that you're able to accomplish great things. And that's been proven over and over again for generations. And in West Long Beach, there is a struggle with that. A lot of the families that live in that neighborhood are living adjacent to an 18 foot wall that backs up to\nSpeaker 4: their homes, which already makes them feel as if they're living in a prison. And one in three Latino males born in this country today are expected to be incarcerated in their lifetime. Growing up with those odds and that environment and living in a community where your park poor and seeing your city not investing in your community has\nSpeaker 4: a long term impact on what sort of citizen or resident you end up being and how you contribute back to your city as an adult. So we're not asking for a plan tomorrow and watching these people grow up and and wake up tomorrow and having the space.\nSpeaker 4: We're asking for more than seven years. We're asking for ten years plus of investment from the city that tonight will be voted on to enact this plan and can be taken over a period of time for the next generation of West Long Beach to have grown up witnessing this investment in their community so that when the next\nSpeaker 4: generation gets to the point where they're voting residents in this community and they're participating in Long Beach, they feel as if they have been a part of the conversation. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Hello again. My name is Malina Ramirez and I live in a sixth district in I has been involved with Long Beach Alliance children with asthma since 1999. And I start being involved because my daughter has been living with asthma since she was like a six month.\nSpeaker 2: Old.\nSpeaker 7: In I would like to buy all those people to come to live to these areas. My kids were attending the Stephens Middle School. My older son were attending the Cabrillo High School in. I saw them howl on the way that they go.\nSpeaker 7: We don't have enough space. Not only, you know, for a respiratory problem, not only for asthma problems. We have a lot of problems because we don't have enough enough green space where we can do exercise, where we can run.\nSpeaker 7: We have many health problems and heart problems. Cancer problems, asthma problems, obesity. I don't know how many things. And sometimes I get a little nervous because my my English. But I want to tell you guys I will I am by you all of people who are.\nSpeaker 10: Saying, oh, don't.\nSpeaker 7: Put these on. Don't do that. I want to invite them to live in my area. Almost 60% of the people who live and thus areas are renting. We don't have enough space inside over our apartments. We need those green areas.\nSpeaker 7: We need to have a space where this kid can run, camp play. It still is that level of contamination. But if we have more wind spaces is going to help a little bit. But it's going to help in I, I want just make you guys think what is living in those areas grow your kids on those are\nSpeaker 7: you before come to talk that they want to change things or do things they need to think about how we feel. I can I can borrow you guys my shoes and and you can you can use my children lives in this area with my kids.\nSpeaker 7: Yes. As the pontymister battles in mirror look SCMP Bass had the label YOLO theme beat though and buy you guys to live in this area is what I can say. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know. I mean nobody said in the Russian Soyuz announcement in.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, good evening. My name.\nSpeaker 7: Is Raskin.\nSpeaker 1: I am a community health worker with the Long Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma for 13 years. Um.\nSpeaker 7: Separately, Orson Welles, the blond beauty, stunned into a traditional salute to California.\nSpeaker 1: 11% of children in central and west Long Beach are diagnosed with asthma, according to the California Health Institute survey.\nSpeaker 7: If you still need one than coriander is my first mirando.\nSpeaker 1: I have seen many children who get an asthma attack as they're running, and it's very sad to watch them.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, I wonder they are not gonna smile and your basil then go, um. Don't really need those nano. Ketamine is easy way to impress. I don't know where this. Yeah. I think they're getting in. One to come into.\nSpeaker 1: I just have a grandson who was diagnosed with asthma last year, and I also have neighbors, one of which is one year of age, who just recently got diagnosed with asthma when his his parents realized as he was, he was starting to run outside and started noticing these changes.\nSpeaker 1: And the parents are still in shock that that the son can't run.\nSpeaker 7: He happened to be that Iceland bed massage. WALLACE But I could not even. Siva But I can control contamination.\nSpeaker 1: And so I support the green tie plan to provide more trees and a better defense for the community.\nSpeaker 7: Standards are one less is important but I don't mean it I mean there are a lot emissions stickers kissing green thumb. Yes but I don't initially. But in the end, this idea.\nSpeaker 1: And having many trees is really important to the air quality. These trees would also be able to capture the toxic emissions and this would begin to help this area where children Canvey.\nSpeaker 7: Island Female Franziska Beetle, the Canino is Toshiko Ambiental. Istanbul. They may not be that, but I get emotional, get emails. So in of touring you know they use immune to massive animals. Muscles. Ambien, Tylenol, ninos. I'd rather have to take it out on me is a God knows why.\nSpeaker 7: Now you are my son.\nSpeaker 1: And so when I say phrases that every breath is a toxic air that they're breathing, and that this environment gives them less time of life. And that's not what we want. We want them to have a better future and that they can have better health and that they can improve and work toward zero emissions for our future\nSpeaker 1: generations. Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the city council. Good to see you all. My name is Steve Gerhart. I'm the project coordinator for a collaborative called Walk Long Beach. Our offices are 425 East Fourth Street in the East Village.\nSpeaker 11: We're a collaboration of City Fabric, the YMCA of Greater Long Beach and the Preventative Health Folks at the Health Department and Collaborative, such as LeBoeuf, the Kaiser's heels on the California Endowment's Building Housing Communities. We've been working for the last few years to promote walking, pedestrian safety and walkable neighborhoods throughout Long Beach.\nSpeaker 11: One outcome of that effort I just wanted to let you know about is that in June, coming up this year, we're going to be hosting here in Long Beach, the California Walks, which is the statewide organization conference walking summit called Pedestrians Count.\nSpeaker 11: And we'll tell you more about that as it gets closer. It should be no surprise to you that we fully support the Green Tea Project as it creates a more walkable Long Beach. It's a strong concept, a first step, an early step, and this will change a underused freeway segment into an urban street.\nSpeaker 11: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and we need to do the studies, which will only happen if you move the atom for tonight. It will create much needed linear, open space. And a lot of the things you've already heard about the staff in the consulting team have done a wonderful job putting together a concept and\nSpeaker 11: idea, and we would like to study it further. I did want to tell you about a couple of things. In October, I attended the National Walking Summit on behalf of Work Long Beach. There were over 500 advocates, including organizations such as the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Vision Zero Network, America Walks.\nSpeaker 11: And one of the highlights of that two day conference was a presentation by the U.S. surgeon general. Many people think of him as America's doctor, talking about a call to action that he proposed in September to promote, walking to and creating walkable communities as a national health imperative and a top priority of the federal government.\nSpeaker 11: This is a call to action about and it's a fundamental change in the way we view walking. One of the things that was raised in the conference, that it's a personal right to be able to walk comfortably and safely in our communities and neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 11: I There was a lot of interesting discussion about Chapter five. I won't go back into it. But one of the things I learned working for Mr. West and Burdick is it's fine and dandy to create a bold and beautiful plan.\nSpeaker 11: The plan is only as good as the implementation. So let's move forward. Let's do the studies and let's get this done. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Vice Mayor and council members. My name is Sylvia Bettencourt. I'm the project manager with the Long Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma. Prior to this meeting, I had submitted a letter to you.\nSpeaker 1: A comment on behalf of.\nSpeaker 4: Myself and Dr. Elisa Nicholas.\nSpeaker 8: Who is the chief executive officer at the children's clinic, serving children with with family.\nSpeaker 1: So I want to read that letter to you today, in.\nSpeaker 8: Part as it reads that we, as the children's clinic and the Long Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma are in support of the Green Plan and see this as a community vision for replacing the.\nSpeaker 1: Terminal Island Freeway.\nSpeaker 8: This plan was developed through intensive resident and stakeholder engagement over the past year, many of which are our clients in central and west Long Beach. La Barca is a community coalition under the.\nSpeaker 4: Institutional umbrella of Miller Children's Hospital, which is a not for profit children's hospital under the corporate ownership.\nSpeaker 8: Of Long.\nSpeaker 4: Beach Memorial Medical Center. Our mission is to change the.\nSpeaker 1: Profile of asthma.\nSpeaker 8: In children in the most affected areas.\nSpeaker 4: Of Long Beach and surrounding.\nSpeaker 8: Communities. The Children's Clinic was founded in.\nSpeaker 4: 1939 by a group.\nSpeaker 8: Of local physicians and community leaders. It's an independent nonprofit, and its largest.\nSpeaker 1: Site is at.\nSpeaker 4: The Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, having 11 sites.\nSpeaker 8: In the city of Long Beach. Its newest clinics are located in the severely impacted West Long Beach area and include the century villages of Cabrillo Housing Development. Research shows that air pollution is likely part of the.\nSpeaker 1: Cause of asthma, demonstrating.\nSpeaker 8: That health impacts of air pollution for children and families living in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: And its surrounding.\nSpeaker 1: Communities are real. The Long Beach area is part of the Southern.\nSpeaker 4: California Air Basin, which, despite significant improvements, remains in violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard specified by the Clean Air.\nSpeaker 1: Act. Because of the universal impact that air.\nSpeaker 8: Pollution has.\nSpeaker 4: On children's health in Long Beach, LA Baca and TCC work hand in hand to prevent pollution from the largest sources in our region. The ports of L.A. and Long.\nSpeaker 8: Beach and the goods movement.\nSpeaker 1: System, the green tie has empowered residents and local stakeholders to craft a vision of their community where public infrastructure serves the public good.\nSpeaker 8: Relocating trucks and pollution they emit from the Terminal Island Freeway would significantly improve the living conditions of West Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 4: As well as a learning environment.\nSpeaker 8: For over 5000 students attending the five campuses.\nSpeaker 4: That are adjacent to the freeway. La Barca and Taxi have engaged have been engaged with these communities surrounding the port complex and have seen firsthand the impacts on public health that freight transport have.\nSpeaker 1: On the community. This experience reveals that the opportunity.\nSpeaker 8: To remove such contiguous uses as truck corridors in schools and homes should be supported.\nSpeaker 4: We ask that City Council support this community effort by adopting the plan and directing staff to take next steps toward making this vision a reality. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council members. My name is Dan Hoffman. I'm the executive director for the Wilmington Chamber of Commerce. I learned the last time I should state upfront that we are opposed to this. I also wanted to mention that the last time I attended your meeting this was mentioned is just a small part of a much\nSpeaker 11: larger project to green the area. And I think we all agree that greening the area, making our environment better, having cleaner air, healthier air is a good thing. However, we have some real concerns about this particular project. One of them is the is the fact that of the transportation efficiency that we're not going to be able to\nSpeaker 11: move goods as efficiently. We learned not too long ago, not too many months ago, that when our cargo was backed up, it was we found customers that found other ways to move their cargo. And it wasn't through our ports of Long Beach or Los Angeles.\nSpeaker 11: Additionally, is.\nSpeaker 14: The impact that it would have.\nSpeaker 11: On our businesses that are in the area and we're talking about what was an estimated 6600 trucks per day is the number that I heard. That's a lot of trucks. And so the businesses that are directly there now are Tesoro, Valero, Tesoro and oh, gosh, California Sulfur of Vopak Harbor, Green Fast Lane Transportation.\nSpeaker 11: And it could be the future site of the big project, which is also needs to be taken into consideration. So I want to also let you know that in terms of the community and as I say, that the last time what it seems like we're doing is we're moving trucks from one area to make it better to\nSpeaker 11: another area. And so our community of Wilmington, me share a couple of facts that you can verify. Our property level in Wilmington is 28.6%, 28.6%, and that's according to the US Census Bureau. If you're familiar with the Cal enviro screen 2.0, Wilmington is the top 10% of impacted communities.\nSpeaker 11: I don't think and I still don't believe that it was ever your intention to move that. Pollution from one community. That's impacted to another community that's more impacted. And I thank you for your time and attention.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the Council. My name is John Taylor, Effie. I want to, first off, thank Councilman Aranda for pushing us forward. I'm going to be frank with all of you. Five years ago or so was the initiation process by the community to move forward, to find resources and find an opportunity to put\nSpeaker 11: together something that would be acceptable to save lives in West Long Beach. This TII freeway was addressed as one of the major buffers that could be that resolution or that that remedy. Last year with Mr. Smith's team, we finally realized that this can actually happen.\nSpeaker 11: And as such, I want to be able to draw attention to the scale or rather the scope of the project itself, because it speaks to efficiency. Our ports operate under an efficiency opportunity. What will happen here is that closure of that TII freeway would utilize that clover on PCH and send the trucks over to be in S.F.\nSpeaker 11: . U.P. is proposing to open their doors into the Alameda corridor where that Alameda corridor was actually established to do this. So common sense tells you now that to do the right thing would be to save the lives of those schoolchildren that are impacted every day and those residents.\nSpeaker 11: And if Labor has it such that they can partnership with a good measure to involve and engage the community, provide a benefit to the community, our ports will continue to flourish because there would be that constructive partnership. So I ask you tonight, please.\nSpeaker 11: To accept, receive and file, and let's move forward to find resources. Let's make this thing happen so that we can truly be a city of Long Beach that is equal for all to live and enjoy. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Madam Vice Mayor, members of the City Council. My name is Chris Wilson. I'm here on behalf of Assembly Member Mike Gibson. We are here to express our strong concerns with regard to green tea. While we appreciate the Fourth Y thinking of this idea, Assembly member Gibson CIL has several concerns.\nSpeaker 11: Mr. Gibson remains concerned about.\nSpeaker 14: The congestion.\nSpeaker 2: This will cause.\nSpeaker 11: Our community.\nSpeaker 2: Which we represent Wilmington and.\nSpeaker 11: In Carson in our district, the impact on our port gateways and the tremendous environmental impacts this.\nSpeaker 2: This would cause.\nSpeaker 11: Wilmington already suffers from one of the highest health disparities in the country. It is estimated that 11,000 trucks each currently utilized the Turtle Island Freeway on a daily basis. These trucks will be transferred to our streets in Wilmington, Carson and nearby communities.\nSpeaker 11: We are also concerned about the lack of outreach and input from neighborhood associations, community members and stakeholders in and nearby the 64th Assembly District. I can tell you that our office was not reached out to and was not on that list you saw before.\nSpeaker 11: We are respectfully.\nSpeaker 14: Requesting.\nSpeaker 11: To please consider the impacts decommissioning this really will cause. We also have the concern in question with regard to sequel. Thank you. Hi. Good evening. My name's John Schaefer. I'm to the pile drivers bridge, dock and Work Builders, which are based in Wilmington, but service the entire Southern California area.\nSpeaker 11: I just wanted to say basically three things. One, I did listen to your council meeting and it brought back memories of my mom who graduated from Saint Anthony, who was born in Germany and, you know, came as an immigrant who didn't know how to speak English.\nSpeaker 11: And she did pass away from asthma and living in San Pedro. But she before she did, she lived in Pico Union, where my brother married, immigrated four people that his wife with four children. And they have suffered from gang violence and drug addiction from a lot of things that came through there.\nSpeaker 11: And he's still living in the area that goes through there. So not only in my working as labor with business, I support a lot of the really positive actions that you're taken already today. I want people to not be separated from their families.\nSpeaker 11: I want good alleyways so people can have proper entrance to go through there. And you guys know that there are some things that comes quick and there are some things that have been waiting for years. For years, port development has been held up because they said they didn't consider all the parties that came through.\nSpeaker 11: You built a Desmond Bridge because you're going to have more ships, taller ships and more containers coming in. You're building that right now. You're building the bridge from Schuyler Highway, which is going directly to the Terminal Island Freeway, because, you know, you're going to have increased traffic because you're getting these bigger ships and you want things to\nSpeaker 11: go out there. And these plans took decades to get approved because there wasn't enough community input. So now you have a proposal that didn't talk to business, that didn't talk to government. It didn't talk to the port. At the port.\nSpeaker 11: That may affect outstanding hours, that may affect current projects. And you want to move forward because one group of your bar community wants to move forward. Ultimately, as government officials, you have to respect a certain amount of process.\nSpeaker 11: And it is apparent to me anyway that no prosthetic complete process hasn't occurred. I'm asking you just to do your job as referee among a bunch of different interests and tell people, look, if you're going to come for action, be prepared for a complete report.\nSpeaker 11: And so, again, I hope all the best. I want all the green, the community, they deserve it. They've gone through a lot. This just isn't ready at this time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. I'm Tonya Reyes, seventh District. I'm here to speak to you for the second time tonight. I have some free time. My husband's busy, so I'm able to come by. I just want to say that let's not get too excited or ahead of ourselves that this is a receiving file item.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm sure the Council will delineate exactly what that means and that give you a little history. In the past eight years, the last two councilmembers have always talked about changes to the tie. We have always talked about maybe closing one of the lanes and making it a one way freeway.\nSpeaker 1: We talked about closing it all altogether. We talked about a lot of things, but what we didn't have is a plan or a vision or community input, and we didn't have that input from other parties as well. But there was always the idea that the tie was inappropriately placed and whether underutilized or misused or whatever it needed\nSpeaker 1: to be changed for the sake of the community, nothing happened. You have a visioning and I wanted to thank the consultants that did the visioning. They really did a complete job. It took them 18 months, I believe. So that means it.\nSpeaker 1: And I also want to thank the port for paying for it, but it's going to take another 7 to 8 years for anything to happen. The port, meanwhile, will be growing. We hope. We want the port to grow.\nSpeaker 1: We want the port to be prosperous. During the visioning sessions in West Palm Beach, the two things, the two top two items is that the community wanted clean air and the second was jobs. We want the port to be successful.\nSpeaker 1: We want good union jobs. We want that play to be able to have local hire and to ensure that our community, the West, Long Beach people, a lot less limited residents take benefit of that local hire agreement. But I have to tell you that while I was on the council, I was also on the South Coast Air\nSpeaker 1: Quality Management District, and we struggled how to find mitigation for the negative effects of the port and port related business. And if you as a council don't figure out mitigation for what's going to happen in the next 7 to 8 years of what's happened now today, then they will make you find a mitigation.\nSpeaker 1: Someone's going to go to court and they will have you do some things that maybe you don't want to do and has it been vetted by the community? So I'm asking you today that, you know, you have to give something to the community that has taken all the negative effects of port and port related businesses and give\nSpeaker 1: them something. And I say give them some hope. At least let them know that you're talking about it, you're thinking about it. And whatever you decide today, you know, it's going to be a tough decision. But whatever you decide today, it's not it's not over.\nSpeaker 1: It's going to take a long time. I think a lot of the studying has just begun. A lot of the inclusion and the input from businesses has just begun. And I never thought I'd be quoting Bob Foster, but I remain of all people.\nSpeaker 1: Right. But when he when when someone said, well, think about Carson and Wilmington residents. Since when are our residents second class and have to take us are just are less valuable than other residents in this area and if we can't take care of Long Beach who can we take care of?\nSpeaker 1: So good luck. And whatever you do, you know the community is with you. But we hope that, you know, again, give them hope. Thanks.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: And I want to say I'll be I'll be late for dinner.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening. My name is Scotty Galloway. I'm a licensed civil engineer and a lead accredited professional. I'm also a father of two kids under five years old. I want another. I've made a career out of sustainability and I want nothing more than more greenspace, more water retention, more water infiltration and.\nSpeaker 11: But those are side benefits of what the primary driver that I've heard here tonight and through other presentations regarding the tie is that it's air quality. And the air quality test that has occurred occurred in 2011. It's been four years.\nSpeaker 11: I've personally installed and managed the installation of 25 to ship power outlets at the Port of Long Beach. Not to mention the other green enhancements that the port has done. More green trucks. And I haven't that's not taken into full effect of what that benefits or those benefits are.\nSpeaker 11: Um, so if we can get the quantifiable effects of what the air quality is now in the area. And has there been an air current study? Because if you only move it a quarter mile or a half a mile to the east or to the west, is that the air currents could still carry the particulates back to\nSpeaker 11: the same area. So I don't I haven't heard any references to the air quality or the air current studies or where the source of all of it is. They're only addressing the part from PCH to Willow. And in closing, I take you back to where we began.\nSpeaker 11: We began the session today with people looking for parking permits and parking concessions. Thanks to term limits. You won't have to deal with it. But think about the your your successors that will have to deal with the residents that are voting for it and for the Green Park now when the trucks start driving through their neighborhood.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 13: Honorable Vice Mayor City Council.\nSpeaker 11: My name is Brian Olszewski and the executive director of City Fabric. We're a nonprofit design studio based out of Long Beach, dedicated to improving our communities through public interest design, planning, policy development and civic engagement. Thank you for having the foresight to apply for the Caltrans Environmental Justice Grant to create this community vision to reshape the West\nSpeaker 11: Side by transforming the term Long Island Freeway, the city owned transit Terminal Island Freeway into a greenbelt and local infrastructure. While some have stated the commissioning would be the largest. Largest freeway removal in Southern California history. A more accurate description would be that it would be the first in Southern California history, but in reality would also be\nSpeaker 11: the smallest urban freeway removal in our nation's history. Based on the numbers vehicles it serves and the length of right of way considered for removal. Previous freeway removal projects included the Riverfront Freeway in Chattanooga, which carry twice as much vehicles.\nSpeaker 11: Portland carries even more Park Park East and Milwaukee carries 35,000. In San Francisco removed two freeways totaling 150,000 vehicles that serve their downtown financial district. That is their economic engine. That is the economic engine of the Bay Area.\nSpeaker 11: Instead. What we're also talking about is New York City is currently looking at removing the Sheridan Freeway, which served the Port Authority's Hunt Point, a port facility that carries three times as many vehicles as the Terminal Island Freeway.\nSpeaker 11: With the Terminal Island freeways paltry 11, about 11,000 vehicles a day. A more relevant comparison would be Broadway Redondo, which recently experienced pedestrian and oriented street enhancement fourth Street, which has wrecked on Retro Row, which has Parklets and SROs, Orange Avenue, North Long Beach, which was reconfigured in 2000 to remove travel lanes to create bike lanes.\nSpeaker 11: According to a 2012 traffic study commissioned by the Port of L.A. for another transportation project, every intersection along this alternative route of Alameda Street operates an E, A or B operations A level of service. There's very few intersections that we drive through regularly that have such a levels of performance.\nSpeaker 11: And Caltrans, I mean, sorry, and the Air Quality Management District and the ports of Long Beach and L.A. are actually collaborating on investing further in this corridor, through that through the zero emissions corridor, which hopefully our trucks will be able to take advantage of.\nSpeaker 11: We're looking at an opportunity to fundamentally change the health and well-being of residents of West Long Beach by defining this higher and greater use of the Terminal Island Freeway. Right of way, transforming this last mile of the Terminal Island Freeway into a local serving street.\nSpeaker 11: And public public open space is a bold step, not one to be taken lightly, but it's nothing to fear as it is the right direction for the community and the city. I hope you will join the overwhelming support within the community by approving this plan and taking the next forward, taking this plan to the next steps.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, City Council. My name is Taylor Thomas. I'm a resident of the First District, former resident of the seventh District, a research and policy analyst with Expert Communities for Environmental Justice. I didn't come here planning to speak, but I was just moved.\nSpeaker 4: I saw all of the energy industry speaking and you're probably looking around and wondering like where all of the residents, right? This is a very important project, so why aren't they here? And I can tell you, as a resident, we already put in our time.\nSpeaker 4: We gave up our Saturday mornings over a very long process to give input on this project. I don't I didn't see any of those people who spoke in opposition to the project at any of those workshops, and they raised the issues about air quality.\nSpeaker 4: Our neighborhoods already have trucks going through them. The air quality is already bad. If that if they were really concerned about what our neighborhoods are going through, they would be cleaning up their trucks. They would be rerouting them to the Alameda corridor.\nSpeaker 4: But instead, they're here fighting a project that will bring green space to an area that is part poor, that suffers high rates of cancer and asthma. Our children missed school because they have asthma. Our parents miss work because they have to care for their children.\nSpeaker 4: It's insulting to the city development services, the staff, the consultants and all of the residents who have been a part of this process for several years to come here and oppose this project tonight. So I'm asking that you do not punish the residents.\nSpeaker 4: You don't punish punish the residents of West Long Beach because people did not take the time to participate in this very lengthy process. So I'm asking you to move forward with this item as is. Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening, counselor. Laura Cortez, Long.\nSpeaker 1: Beach Alliance for Children with Asthma. I also want to point out that we did have some community members that came by, also had to leave a little earlier. And I would also like to express my support for the Green Terminal.\nSpeaker 7: Island plan and.\nSpeaker 1: Hope that you can prioritize clean air and environment, since this is what the community felt was important during the workshops. We all know that Long Beach suffers many health impacts, including 15,000 children with asthma, according to the L.A. County survey, and that the West has less park space than East Long Beach and is disproportionately affected by particulate\nSpeaker 1: matter, as was stated in the earlier presentation. Greening the tie would have huge positive impacts on the West, as you already know, and you have already, it seems to have a recommendation to move forward with this. So we would just greatly appreciate that you continue working toward it and continue working with other organizations to do so.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 12: Good evening, Vice Mayor. City Council. My name is Leigh Fukui. I'm a resident of sixth district. I'm a founding member of regular is going green. It's a tree planting organization, also a member of Wrigley Clean team. And I'm a member of the city's Tree Advisory Committee.\nSpeaker 12: I was kind of shocked at how many people came out in opposition to this. This is a park and it's a park that in a that's necessary in a badly neglected part of town. It's park poor. The residents are obviously suffering from high cases of asthma, cancer, etc..\nSpeaker 12: This is all we all know this. So what is the problem? Why? Why is it that every time we have something like this that we have the unions come out? The truck drivers come out and say, no, no, no, that we want to keep everything the same.\nSpeaker 12: Keeping every everything the same isn't the answer. We need to move forward. We need to create more park space. And there's very limited areas to do that. This is a smart plan. It's a good plan. It's a necessary plan.\nSpeaker 12: We just had the forest wetlands open up and that's going to link up with the Mingus gap. That's going to link up with the River Link project, and that's going to connect to other parks that's necessary. That's what we have to do for Long Beach.\nSpeaker 12: That's what we have to do for our citizens. That's our responsibility. We can get there and we can get zero emissions, but we're going to have to sacrifice some things. It's going to be hard, but to say keep everything the way it is is not a solution.\nSpeaker 12: There's going to be sacrifices going to have to be made. The Clean Trucks program is working. The port is doing its best to make it a clean port. We're getting there. This is another as someone else said, this is another piece of the puzzle.\nSpeaker 12: It's necessary. We shouldn't be fighting over this. More parks are good. It's good for the environment. It's good for our city. It's good to attract more clean energy jobs and clean energy companies to here. How are we going to be attractive if we're if we keep looking the way we do?\nSpeaker 12: I mean, we already have this diesel death zone that we're trying to shed. We have a number of hurdles that we have to shed in this city to get and attract those businesses. Those new entrepreneurs, they're looking at other cities.\nSpeaker 12: Seattle. Portland. You're talking about losing port jobs. I'm sorry, but you know, that's competition. You are going to get competition from other ports that are opening up. But we have to see that and we have to encourage greener jobs to come here.\nSpeaker 12: That's the future. I'm sorry, but thank you. Please move this forward. Thank you very.\nSpeaker 0: Much. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Good name.\nSpeaker 6: Vice-Chair City Council. My name is Tony Rivera, former.\nSpeaker 2: Chair of the West Side. I just want to tell everybody thank you for the openness on this project. I staff and everybody else did a very good job. I went to some of the meetings. It was open to the public for everybody to assist.\nSpeaker 2: It was publicized very well. I got like three messages and 1.3 messages on the computer and all over the place. I know it was there.\nSpeaker 6: So one thing.\nSpeaker 2: I want to mention is this piece of the freeway and I'm on parole, by the way. I'm proud of the project. So one little piece on the freeway is only going to affect a few people. This is only traffic is only going to the rail rail.\nSpeaker 2: It has projects that is going to go through Alameda corridor. We spent over 280 millions on the line. I mean, a corridor. And they better use it.\nSpeaker 3: They better use it.\nSpeaker 2: In their road. Myself, I had trucks.\nSpeaker 6: I have a business on the way, so.\nSpeaker 2: I know that we might have a problem. Too much traffic on PCH. We might need to consider later on on up in Anaheim. But the traffic today, it took me from Long Beach Freeway to Santa Fe just to get to my business.\nSpeaker 2: It took me 20 minutes. So I don't want to hear the other people. The way they.\nSpeaker 6: Said it is going to create problems. Locsin has a legitimate concern, but I need to tell you, I'm one of the pioneers of the.\nSpeaker 2: Weeds in Alameda is one of the correct roads to go with over weeds. They have a really good sound road. It's just a matter of changing it. When the project goes through, it has to be changed so they can get the weeds through there.\nSpeaker 2: Right now, that's the only problem I see on the other ways I mention it to them, because they came in and they got they got a lot of business.\nSpeaker 6: On the side of the warehouses.\nSpeaker 2: But that doesn't justify to start the the project to benefit all these people that we've been suffering. I've been in almost 40 years and doing business or working with companies and it's time to work together. Union I'm sorry, but the.\nSpeaker 6: Union I love union and I love the longshoremen's. I got friends working there, but they need to get to work together to move more trucks at night.\nSpeaker 2: Quickly because I got people there waiting 5 hours on the port. There's a lot of contamination.\nSpeaker 6: And the contamination of these get done that the port.\nSpeaker 2: Is already clean. Let's cut that off. The rail is the problem. A locomotive that comes through there, the Union Pacific or anyone, there's not a black locomotives is contaminated like crazy more than the port or more than a lot of cars in combine.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Vice Mayor. Council members give me this. Time to speak. As a veteran, disabled veteran from the Vietnam era. I enlisted twice, but I felt getting out of high school, I was in good shape. B Damn, what's going on?\nSpeaker 6: So a lot of people getting drafted back in that area and I joined. I believe that I can serve my country in the way I feel in my heart that I can do. My attitude is grabbing the bull by the horns.\nSpeaker 6: Take care of action. A lot of veterans are the same way we came home. Even up to now, every company and you probably hear about it gets a $5,000 tax write off if they hire a veteran. A lot of the veterans, especially now the younger post-9-11 veterans, come back from Iraq, Afghanistan.\nSpeaker 6: You know, it's part of war. They come back not another percent PTSD or they do the arm or leg. These companies hire veterans. Because they'd done their job. You know, now we got to help them do their jobs.\nSpeaker 6: And I'm proof of that. I work down here, but I because of my knees, I had to replace them. I'm like a 53 Chevy, you know, replace bar joints and stuff like that. But anyway, I don't have any grits and I don't have anything that's growing up in Wilmington.\nSpeaker 6: I'm healthy. Stage shape, meet the right food. And I think that's the problem with this small community. It's shocking. I feel embarrassed by you guys discussing. I heard somebody say there's 50,000 people in that residence. Only a fraction of them show up here.\nSpeaker 6: So who's really concerned about the greenbelt? The people who work for them or the people they get paid to do the survey. I mean, these people here, here, they got good information. But you guys live in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: Did they pay you good money? Okay. These people that live there, that Green Park. They get paid. I've been in a couple of villages and some of their. I got veterans right here and there. I help one to PTSD and I gave them Easter cards.\nSpeaker 6: The kids go and there's officers. I'm pretty sure you'll have your office up here. Do you have air purifiers? Why not research the schools and the residents? They're paying rent. They don't own the houses. They're paying rent. Whoever owns those properties, they should investigate.\nSpeaker 6: That's a good job for you guys to do. Follow up on that before you start going with this. Put veterans out of work and the truckers and make sure those houses are up to par with. If it's, you know, progress is going to go forward.\nSpeaker 6: You need to make sure those schools there have air, clean air, like you do in your offices up here. In the hospital air purifiers they suck all the the stuff to fly around in the dust, not just from the port, but from the house closing the people who own the property, they're not going to go.\nSpeaker 6: That costs too much money. And for the to help the vetters keep their jobs and keep fighting them when they come home. They didn't get the Vietnam Veterans parade. I have not seen one. But yet the people were making sure that the young veterans come back.\nSpeaker 6: And take care of the veterans so it don't happen like us and you. My name is Jonathan Cassata. I am a chaplain. Vietnam Veterans of America, average life member and also now a Native American betters. I want to thank you all.\nSpeaker 6: I hope you really think about it. Investigate with the community, the houses.\nSpeaker 0: And time is up.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I appreciate it. Apologize often. I'm a talker and I get frustrated. I talk and I thank you all. God bless you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 12: Good evening. Madam Vice Mayor and honorable members of council. I'm Richard Hines. I'm proud to be one of your five Harvard commissioners, and I know everyone's very tired. And I'll be very brief because I didn't write a long speech.\nSpeaker 12: I did want to come down and clarify that the port and the Board of Commissioners specifically have not taken a position on the green tie. My comments tonight are just my views and they don't represent the Board of Harbor Commissioners.\nSpeaker 12: I absolutely support, as my vote indicated, to help pay for a study and to support the West Long Beach Livability Plan. But the board, myself included, support our community. We're part of the community. I did want to mention, though, I mean, we've seen a lot of pro and con tonight, and I think we need to try and\nSpeaker 12: bring everyone together here. If we move forward with a study. It's going to be important that we look at replacement infrastructure. If you take out an overweight corridor that supports the movement of goods from our port, we're going to have to build new infrastructure.\nSpeaker 12: The good news is there is a project that would help tremendously. And Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez is the chair of the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, which I sit on the board with her. And there is a project that connects the Schuyler High Bridge directly to PCH in Alameda.\nSpeaker 12: The 47 flyover goes directly over Alameda Street, bypasses five stop signs and stoplights, creates snack grade separation for all the rail tracks. And. The reason why truck drivers don't use Alameda is it's not convenient. We need to make Alameda convenient as a true overweight corridor and have the ice ETF realign their gates to Alameda.\nSpeaker 12: And if there is a gig that will be built, that they be built on Alameda, their gates as well. You see, if we build this project, we wouldn't have the need to move 6000 trucks down the down the Thai freeway.\nSpeaker 12: Right now, this project is $330 million. And I come here asking for your help because it's going to it's a heavy lift. It's going to take the city and the port. And we're going to have to engage the city of L.A. to work together to get $330 million.\nSpeaker 12: We have a green light. It was sued by the. There was litigation by the NRDC. And it's been we've won every lawsuit at the state level, at the federal level. We went through the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and won.\nSpeaker 12: So I only ask that we if we're looking at a study that we look at this project as well, because this is this is a real solution. If we can get our S.R. 47 flyover, then I think that a lot of the people that spoke in opposition tonight, they may be okay, because I think we have a\nSpeaker 12: real solution here. Anyway, that's all I have for you. Thank you so much. I know it's been a long night and you guys have had a lot of public comment and I'm happy to answer any questions if you guys have anyone to discussion.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thanks, Rich. We will take it behind the dias. Sir. You've already know. No. On different issues. They were different issues.\nSpeaker 6: Well.\nSpeaker 0: Sir, we cannot speak from we can't speak from the audience. Thank you. We've heard your testimony. I appreciate it.\nSpeaker 6: All right. I know where.\nSpeaker 0: And that's an unfortunate characterization. Thank you, sir. Please have a seat. Okay. I will take you behind the dias, Councilmember. Your Honor.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Vice Mayor. First of all, I want to thank everybody who spoke tonight on both sides of this matter. We're paying attention. We listened. We're going to discuss it. Obviously, there's there's a lot of emotion attached to it.\nSpeaker 2: It's not an easy decision where we sit here and try to decide which direction we want to take on a matter that's so important to not only transportation and goods movement, but also to the residents of those areas that are going to be affected by it.\nSpeaker 2: In regards to the clean air and the mobility, that that is much needed there. I want to emphasize again what I said earlier. It's it's a a project in concept. It can change. And I'm pretty sure that it will change as we move forward with this.\nSpeaker 2: If we do, in fact, move forward with this, it's not a project already in place. The recurring theme that I heard tonight from both sides is that it's incomplete. There's still a lot more things that need to be accomplished.\nSpeaker 2: I met with a contingency contingent of goods movement, people led by the Future Ports. Elizabeth Warren and I and I made a promise at that meeting. I said, if anything goes forward, we're going to engage them. We're going to go to the stakeholders.\nSpeaker 2: We're going to make sure that they are involved in that discussion and participate in that conversation, because apparently there's been somewhat of a lapse, if you want to call it that. But this is one part in a long, lengthy process that's taking place, and there's a lot of moving parts to this.\nSpeaker 2: You know, we can go from A to B or to C or D without going through those steps. And this is one step in that process. So I want to make sure that, you know, that I want to make sure you know that I did hear you.\nSpeaker 2: And there is information that's lacking here. We don't have a complete transportation study. We don't know what the effects of closing that one mile stretch of the to freeway will do to the goods movement. We need to know that if we're going to do anything at all.\nSpeaker 2: So what I would like to do is to amend the motion to move that the city of Long Beach work with the cities of Los Angeles and Carson and the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to develop a plan for goods.\nSpeaker 2: Movement. Transportation. Without this segment of the to freeway and to fill any necessary gaps. I would like to move that. We continue more outreach with our stakeholders and provide a more detailed design and potential sources of capital and operational funding, including grants.\nSpeaker 2: And I would like to have a progress report on their movement within six months. So what I'm trying to do with this motion basically is say. Let's let's study it further. Let's move it along so that everybody who at the end of the day, we have all of the information that's needed.\nSpeaker 2: And we're not just stopping here tonight. If we do not go forward, we do not go forward. There's nothing there. And everybody's at a loss and nothing happens. And it's it's status quo. We can't have status quo. We need to help.\nSpeaker 2: We have to help people move their goods in an efficient way. I just heard about a solution right now with the CTA, which is which was a plan that was developed, what, ten, 15 years ago. So we need to move with that.\nSpeaker 2: We need to endorse that project by endorsing this. So I, I made the motion and I hope I can help to have the support of my council members. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I will. Thank you, Councilmember Urunga. So you've made a motion and it's been seconded by Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilman, with those, would you like to address the motion?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, I, too, want to thank everybody for being here. Everybody had some great comments in relation to the West Side. I know both Councilmember Suranga and myself are very much invested in the West Side and I know both business owners and residents alike.\nSpeaker 4: I know how much we all have endured many issues along the West Side. I myself live on the western side of the city, not the west side, but the western side of the city. I'm very proud to represent part of that, both industry and residents.\nSpeaker 4: And I think this is a beautiful, beautiful plan. It certainly is. I think this is a very a plan that did incorporate a lot of community input. But I, I will have to agree with Councilmember Suranga that there are some missing pieces with that as well.\nSpeaker 4: And so not to say that this is not going to move forward, you know, that's not to say that at all. But I think there does need to be further discussion, further study so we can look at other pieces.\nSpeaker 4: I myself personally did not get a briefing until two weeks ago. And it's unfortunate. You know, I know that my my staff member went to one meeting, but it's unfortunate that I was not personally briefed on this. And I you know, I don't know where the missing link was on that, but I feel that there needs to\nSpeaker 4: be more. This is a it's a huge undertaking to have this put presented in front of us. And for us as council members to make a decision like this, I think there needs to be more information put in front of us, all of us.\nSpeaker 4: I do have a few questions related to the plan. I do share the actor, the Alameda Quarter Transportation Authority. I also chair the i 17 Project Committee. I'm also on SCAD. I understand that it went to SAG back in July.\nSpeaker 4: How does this marry with other governing board plans? I know that the S.R. 47, I don't think has been discussed, so it would be good to have that studied within the plan. But has this been presented to the I 710 Project Committee?\nSpeaker 0: That's a question. The city manager.\nSpeaker 6: Angela Reynolds. So answer that.\nSpeaker 0: I believe the answer is no.\nSpeaker 12: All right. So we've discussed.\nSpeaker 6: This with ACOG, but not specifically with the 710 Project Oversight Committee.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. And so it would be good to do that as well or to have some sort of, you know, relationship with the two. Because I think it's important that all of these plans are put together. I want to see the cohesion of all of these plans and make it a very mindful and fruitful plan.\nSpeaker 4: But to include the I seven term project committee, which now actually includes the River Link plan, which is very important as well, especially to the West Side. Also as our 47, as we discuss and then as far as logistics, I still haven't heard a specific solution.\nSpeaker 4: I know the traffic solutions perhaps that could be in the study, but there were there are 11,000 trucks going trucks and cars going down the RTI. So where exactly would be they be moved to?\nSpeaker 8: Well, Councilman Gonzales, I think I can take a crack at that. It's about 11,000 vehicles estimated now. About half of them are trucks. So that's more like 6000 trucks at the Cloverleaf at PCH. They can either go east or west at this present time, and they do so.\nSpeaker 8: That's a heavily traveled route. They go west, they go to the Alameda corridor. They go east. They go over to the 710. But we have that's just a bird's eye view. We have not done any environmental studies. And the categorical exemption that is going along with this project is that it's exempt from security because it's a feasibility\nSpeaker 8: study and it doesn't have any entitlements or funding or anything connected to it. So if we proceed to do more study and more outreach, then comes the secure piece, which is an air, complete air. And we probably would also look at the federal side, the NEPA, the the NEPA view as well.\nSpeaker 8: So those kinds of things won't come until we actually have a project description and we're moving forward. But they will come.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. And so I just want to. And then outreach to other cities. I'll emphasize that as well. Of course, Carson City of L.A. to include San Pedro and Wilmington, of course. Again, just reiterating the fact that, you know, many of us sit on regional boards and to sit on these regional boards with other colleagues of ours that\nSpeaker 4: are from other cities, it's important that we can speak to these issues, to speak to these projects very articulately, and that we can do so in a way that really works together with these cities, not just putting a plan in place and not having worked with them.\nSpeaker 8: Councilwoman Gonzales We completely understand, and that's really the first step, is all the logistics of getting everybody to the table. This was a high level concept with the community. That is what was funded through the Caltrans grant. We have it's even written in the implementation, all those other folks that we need to get together with.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. And then lastly, I know that, uh. So asthma, of course, is a huge issue. I know that the Port of Long Beach had, um. Were that was there any talk of reinstituting asthma programs from the Port of Long Beach?\nSpeaker 4: Because I know that, uh, we had not been doing that anymore. So how. How was that?\nSpeaker 8: I'm sorry. I'm having a hard time hearing you. Are you asking if we met with the Asthma Coalition or.\nSpeaker 4: Well, not the Asthma Coalition. I know the Port of Long Beach had been funding some asthma programs, and so it's no longer happening at this point. So I just wanted to see what the discussion was during these community meetings about reinstituting programs like that.\nSpeaker 12: Right.\nSpeaker 8: I think that the that asthma program is run out of the Health and Human Services Department and in the West, Livable West, Long Beach Plan. We note that as an overall project in that area that we would like to continue to seek funding for.\nSpeaker 6: And Councilmember, if I can add, we are very aware that the asthma program was funded by the community mitigation grants. That was part of that bucket of money that was distributed out as part of the impacts from some of the port projects.\nSpeaker 6: And so that is coming to an end that grant cycle. And we have been having discussions with the executive officer at the Port of Long Beach over how important that program is and seeing how that can get restarted and refunded.\nSpeaker 4: Do we know how much that cost? Uh.\nSpeaker 6: I don't have a bit on my head, but I'd be happy to get that to you.\nSpeaker 4: Great. Thank you. And I will support Councilmember Unger's motion on that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales. Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. So in the last few hours of discussion, I've been trying to keep track so I can understand both sides of this issue. So it sounds like the folks who are pro this motion tonight want a receiver file.\nSpeaker 3: And the folks who are opposed to this want to receive a file. The folks who are in support of this want a traffic study. The people who are opposed to this want a traffic study. The people who are in support of this one year fully air and seek peer review.\nSpeaker 3: And people who are opposed to this want the same before air and seek review. But I have a letter from the city of Carson that, you know, asked for a detailed analysis to be done to evaluate the impacts of projects on, you know, of the project on traffic conditions, noise, air quality, vehicle, miles traveled, all these things\nSpeaker 3: that I know are considered in a traffic study and environmental review. I have a. This green tie plan that I took the last 2 hours to highlight. And I'm just going to review page 61 says the later study phases of the Green Sky project will have to examine environmental and regulatory environmental issues, risks, potential mitigations and much\nSpeaker 3: more detail than has been previously addressed thus far because of the urgency and significance of these issues. It's recommended that environmental study be conducted as soon as possible to help determine the project's feasibility. Ideally, this should commence as soon as the project is defined to a sufficient level of detail.\nSpeaker 3: So the capital and operating costs as well as a purpose in each statement can be provided. It also says additional state and local laws and industry standards to be considered include but are not limited to CPC state and federal laws.\nSpeaker 3: Full range of environmental impact assessments from noise to air water runoff. A traffic analysis so significant for study. Further study is needed to fully understand all of the traffic implications which are discussed in more detail below. Neighboring impacts, particularly on residents and disadvantaged communities such as those in West Long Beach, Wilmington and Carson.\nSpeaker 3: A significant issue for further implementation of the Green PSI project involves the impact that reduced lanes and speed may have on traffic in the subregion and in effective adjacent neighborhoods and major facilities. So. So I guess my first question is, when did this document get when was this document circulated the actual plan?\nSpeaker 3: When was this circulating? Or put put forward?\nSpeaker 8: Councilman Richardson. Yes, that was posted on our website about two weeks ago.\nSpeaker 12: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: And since that was put out or even before that, have we actually reached out to the city of Carson City, Los Angeles, at all, at any point?\nSpeaker 8: No, I don't believe we have.\nSpeaker 12: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: I would say. I see. I just think we sort folks got ahead of each other and. I see. I mean, when you just take a step back and look at it. Everything folks are asking for is here. And it's not anyone.\nSpeaker 3: One of these councils intention to circumvent any processes or to not speak to any of the stakeholder groups or any of the adjacent cities. But I do think because the cart got got ahead of the horse. I think Councilman Durango was right in saying that we should intentionally reach out to those adjacent communities.\nSpeaker 3: Now, since we receive, we should respond to this letter what what they're asking for. This letter says City of Carson didn't receive any information. So we respectfully request request to be included in all future discussions, deliberations. We deal with their council members on different boards.\nSpeaker 3: We deal with their city managers. We have a pretty good relationship with their staff. So I think it goes a long way to just pick up a phone and make a phone, pick up the phone and make a phone call.\nSpeaker 3: So that would be my first suggestion coming out of this. And I think that the motion on the table satisfies that. And are there any challenges or legal issues with us picking up the phone and making a call?\nSpeaker 3: Mr. City Manager.\nSpeaker 2: No.\nSpeaker 3: No. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: And Councilmember, if I can add, we agree with that point and we actually did speak with the Carson today. They called and asked for some backup on their on the project. And we explained what the next steps were.\nSpeaker 6: And the number one step, as you saw, would be to discuss if the plan moves forward to discuss with Carson and City of Los Angeles.\nSpeaker 12: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: So just to be clear, does any of the action tonight actually close the freeway or does it get us out of our square requirements whatsoever?\nSpeaker 8: Councilmember Richardson. No, it doesn't close the freeway.\nSpeaker 12: And.\nSpeaker 8: We certainly don't ever want to circumvent secure and the environmental process. And we fully intend to do that and meet with all the other stakeholders and get it all done prior to.\nSpeaker 12: Ever thinking.\nSpeaker 8: About closing the freeway. There's a lot of work still to be done. This, again, is a preliminary concept plan. We didn't reach out to a lot to other cities such as Carson, because it's just a concept plan coming out of the city.\nSpeaker 12: Of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: And I understand that. So my question now is about what's included in that next level of study. Tonight, we I heard about this flyover, and I can't say that I'm an expert on every freeway in that area. It's not my council district.\nSpeaker 3: It's not my job to be the expert in that area. But it sounded like there's a really cool project that the port is excited about. And and I know because of all of the history I know about skiing and the intention there is to remove or remove trucks and idling and all that stuff.\nSpeaker 3: And so will all of that be considered in the air or in the environmental study, the impacts to these other infrastructure projects?\nSpeaker 8: Absolutely. There's a section in the in an ER where you have to look at all the cumulative project impacts and that would be including skiing.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Now the next question, does what level of design or what level in the process does this project have to have to actually achieve before you can actually go through the air process? Is there a threshold like 5% design or something like that?\nSpeaker 8: I would say 5 to 10%. But really when you start an environmental process, you have to have a fully vetted what they call a project description. So yeah, you would have to have at least 5%. 10 to 15 would probably be better so that you knew exactly what you were studying.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And do we have that today?\nSpeaker 8: No, we don't.\nSpeaker 13: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: So there's no way we could have done that prior to now.\nSpeaker 8: No. Plus, this is a non funded I mean, the 250,000 from Caltrans was just to prepare what we prepared. There is no other funding associated with this project at this time.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So so those are my questions. And it's pretty clear to me that, you know, the community is divided on this particular will. Stakeholders in the community are divided on this. And particularly because the process has evolved enough to even get to the point of negotiating a place where, you know, different stakeholders are happy or you have\nSpeaker 3: consensus on the issue. Luckily, have you know, most of the stakeholders have consensus. So you halfway there, you've got labor and business together. So now you've got to figure out the rest. I would say, you know, I could see how since this is so new in that, you know, that's that's that brings uncertainty.\nSpeaker 3: And I understand how that might be challenging for business or for port entries or how decommissioning a freeway or transitioning a freeway could be challenging or even scary. But that only underscores why we should study it even more, folks, to understand it.\nSpeaker 3: I don't I can't claim to understand it. And I think there is a deeper level of understanding that we need here, because I don't think anyone's going to argue that we need infrastructure. But I also wouldn't say that anybody's going to argue that we need environmental justice.\nSpeaker 3: So I just think we're a little bit premature in general to jump to. I support I have pros. I want to learn more. So I'm glad to hear that this action tonight does not stop us from having an absolutely full EIA seek review and traffic study.\nSpeaker 3: So that's those are my comments and I'll be in support.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Richardson. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Can I just get some clarification on the motion that's on the floor? From anyone.\nSpeaker 0: Sure.\nSpeaker 6: I could see vice vice mayor, members of the council. I was going to ask for clarification. I heard the amendment by Councilmember Urunga, but I believe if I understood it correctly, his motion is to receive and file the Green Terminal Island Transition Plan in accordance with the terms of the Department of Transportation grant and accept the categorical\nSpeaker 6: exemption, and then added to that directed staff to reach out to the additional affected community members and communities affected by this project.\nSpeaker 0: So if I may, Mr. Park, and that would be specifically these asking for the city of Long Beach to work with the cities of Los Angeles and Carson and the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to develop a plan for goods movement that does not consider this segment of the freeway without this segment of the Terminal\nSpeaker 0: Island Freeway and filling us this very gaps. And I think the motion also went on to ask that we continue. Extended outreach with stakeholders and more. And provide more detailed design and potential sources of capital and operation funding, including grants.\nSpeaker 0: And then you'd like a report back in six months. On the progress.\nSpeaker 2: I think the. The key issue, I think, to the culture of looking at is, is the initial receiver filed a motion. My amendment was not to receive a file amendment was to to do this replace the receiver file with this.\nSpeaker 0: So if I may, Councilmember, I you.\nSpeaker 4: That's what I heard you say. But then I wasn't sure.\nSpeaker 0: So.\nSpeaker 6: Vice Mayor and council, if I may. I think the council, it's requested here that you receive the documents in compliance with the grant terms and conditions and accept the category exemption. I think by identifying that plan and accepting it, it's complying with the terms of the money that paid for it.\nSpeaker 0: So that's a step that we'd have to take. And and then you can add to it the portion of your motion.\nSpeaker 2: I think my concern basically is that I don't want to spread this. I have to go on a shelf. Right.\nSpeaker 0: And. Absolutely. I think that that's a concern that we may all share. And the receiving file terminology is actually quite awkward for the action that we're taking because it does sound like we're shelving it and that's not what it means.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you for that clarification.\nSpeaker 4: Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you. Yes, I appreciate that clarification. And, you know, like my colleagues who spoke before me this evening, I'm very grateful for all the comments and the perspectives that everyone brought to the table tonight. I think it's really, really helpful for all of us and the decisions that we're making.\nSpeaker 4: And I understand this is a long term project and the funding source hasn't been identified. And we're really talking about conceptual planning right now, and I get that. But sometimes when we talk about conceptual planning, people start to get a sense of hope about a project and they want that.\nSpeaker 4: And I get that. That's that's how it should be. So if we need to do any studies or have any sort of additional outreach, I think that needs to be clarified early so that everybody understands that we're going to go through that process if additional outreach is needed with the other cities or the other folks who have\nSpeaker 4: expressed concern and I share with Councilman Richardson, you know, it's not uncommon to hear from business or to hear from labor, but it is uncommon to hear from them together, expressing the same concern about something that is as important as goods movement.\nSpeaker 4: So I think it's definitely worth looking at and I just want to make sure that we're all clear that as this project moves forward, there's going to be an opportunity for all the stakeholders to be briefed and have the opportunity to have workshops and dialog.\nSpeaker 4: And I think that's the spirit of the motion. Councilman Urunga Is that the spirit of the motion? Okay, I think that's great because I think it's a beautiful design. By the way, the team that has designed this, it's it's a really a beautiful design and a beautiful design for an area that definitely needs it at this time\nSpeaker 4: . So I think I will be supporting this motion. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 12: Yes. Thank you. You're not to listen to all of this. I think it's very important that all of us understand that this is a long ways down the you know, the pipe. But the thing about it, just like Mrs. Ewing made the motion, that it gives us hope.\nSpeaker 12: And that's what I think is so important, because the fact, especially in a district like mine, that's all most of our entire structure is about hope. And this is shown is something that I think if we do get to that point where we will find the money for this, I think it will be something that we'll all\nSpeaker 12: enjoy. And I want to think. Thank Mr.. Yeah. Your anger and and our colleagues here and I hope that they will support this as written. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Can I go?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I want to thank the councilman for expanding the input stage. I, I really see a value in looking at what a potential reduction of the type freeway's movement of freight could do in terms of additional bottlenecks, delays and the such that would cause additional idling and even more health hazards.\nSpeaker 1: And so I appreciate the hope that Commissioner Dynes brings us with a project that would pull the trucks out of the the freeway completely and do an on rail dockside rail option that could really improve the health and quality of everyone.\nSpeaker 1: And I know that even today I was in a meeting for several hours where a group of neighbors wanted us to make a change, that all it did was shift the issue from their area on to their neighbors.\nSpeaker 1: And we're looking for solutions that resolve things. So I'm really appreciative that stakeholders of neighbors, regional and industry partners will have a forum to have a discussion. I think that over the last several weeks I've talked a lot with the community about the process that council meetings have in which you have 3 minutes to make a point\nSpeaker 1: , but the person behind you might make a counterpoint that you then don't have an opportunity to address because the format of which council meetings are is to allow for public comment. But the dialog and discussions that can be had at a stakeholder forum I think are the most important component of our ability to come up with solutions\nSpeaker 1: . So with that, I'm going to be supportive of the motion and I am glad that we will be doing an air. I think that knowing and understanding the impacts on our neighbors is a really important component of our future, and I hope that we find a great way to move this additional freight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. And I want to thank all the members of the community and stakeholders that came out to speak to this item. I know. Although we are not taking action to. Decommissioned the freeway in the very, very immediate future.\nSpeaker 0: It was important to each of you to have us understand where you're coming from. I wanted to touch on a couple of things that were raised by council members that I think are really salient points here. I know staff was duly taking notes on them.\nSpeaker 0: I would like to highlight a question that Councilwoman Gonzalez asked, and not because you did not hear it, but it is something that we value very deeply here. And that's a process we've heard about process for many members of the community.\nSpeaker 0: And and we do feel that a tremendous amount of outreach had taken place. And in outreach processes, it's difficult to ensure that everyone is included. But certainly we've heard from a lot of people today. And so these are these are the people definitely that we would include going forward in the continued outreach.\nSpeaker 0: As the amended motion asks for, but just our own process and my own understanding about our committee process. I've never served on the I 710 Freeway, but I do think Councilwoman Gonzales makes a very strong point that this is something that should be presented there.\nSpeaker 0: We have committee processes for that reason. And and there's a perspective there that regards this issue in the larger context of the 710 Freeway and Council. Former Councilwoman Turanga served on that committee and chaired that committee for some time, and I believe she would agree that this is something that should go there.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales, for raising that and and being honest and in letting us know that that had not taken place. So I think our internal process needs to improve as well. And the feasibility study is while it seems as though we are taking immediate steps to close this freeway and create the park space that we\nSpeaker 0: indicate we'd like to. It is really a first step in being able to qualify to ask that larger question and consider that larger question. And so for members of the public that felt that this meant that this was much farther down the road, I want to assure you, unfortunately for many of us that work in planning, this\nSpeaker 0: is the start of a very long process. And I think Ms.. Reynolds mentioned that earlier. And so community members that have been with us Saturday mornings and committed your days. Unfortunately, it's not over. It's much longer process than that.\nSpeaker 0: So I ask all of you interested on either side of the issue to maintain your stamina and follow this project through? This is something that Mr. Ulysses Jeff Sky had mentioned to me in 2006. And so while it might be new to some of us, it's not new to all of us.\nSpeaker 0: And I'd like to thank you, Brian, for your ardent and strident advocacy of this issue. It is something that you have worked on for quite some time, as you have many other projects. And as a member of the community who many of you have commented that you don't get paid for volunteer time.\nSpeaker 0: I will submit to you a lot of people don't get paid for their volunteer time. And Mr. Liszewski spent the better part of ten years advocating for this. And I live in the city. You live in the city?\nSpeaker 0: This is something that we can see through. It is not impossible to imagine where 11,000 trips a day can go, how they can be diverted. When a community inspires a will to improve its quality of life, they do think it's worth our attention and our time to take note and and allow ourselves to ask that question.\nSpeaker 0: So this council is not afraid to ask that question, even if it is a process that will take ten years from now. So, Brian, I thank you for that. I thank you for never taking your eye off the prize and holding us to it.\nSpeaker 0: Would that council members please cast your vote?\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Item 25 Report from Financial Management.

        "source": "Speaker 0: Okay. Well, Debbie Porter, you there you are. Do you want to come up and give a brief overview and then we'll hear from if it's okay with council, we'll hear from the public speakers and then we'll make our comments.\nSpeaker 0: Hello.\nSpeaker 10: Good evening, Council Mayor. I'm Debbie Potter, the community development director for the city. And the item before you this evening is a recommendation to approve a First Amendment to our agreement with a central league out to provide legal assistance to low income tenants.\nSpeaker 10: This was a contract that was approved in November of 2018. It was approved as a three year contract. It was funded for a total amount of $500,000, with the funding spread pretty much in equal parts across three years, about $166,000 per year.\nSpeaker 10: Last year, the first year of the contract was from November of 2018 to November of 2019. And at the conclusion of the first year of the contract staff, primarily myself and Michael Rausch from the City Attorney's Office, sat down with central legal staff to discuss how the first year had been, how they felt about their work scope\nSpeaker 10: and the service delivery. And based on the annual report, some of the quarterly reporting and conversations with staff, it was decided by both central legal staff as well as city staff, that it probably made sense to renegotiate the work scope for this current year of the contract.\nSpeaker 10: The second year of the three year contract staff is not recommending any additional funding or reduction in funding. Essentially, we're recommending a reallocation of funds with a revised work scope. The primary change is to modify the work scope so that there is a reduction in the number of folks served for the legal services to reduce that number\nSpeaker 10: and to reallocate funding for two general activities one to increase the budget for outreach. There have been some challenges in reaching some of the tenants. Low income tenants in Alameda. So Centro is proposing to do more robust outreach in this upcoming year.\nSpeaker 10: And then there is a recommendation to reallocate funds for an emergency financial assistance program. And that is a program that central legal has been running countywide. And in the city of Oakland since December of 2018. And Alameda tenants have been able to take advantage of that emergency financial assistance via Centro's contract with the county.\nSpeaker 10: That contract is set to expire in May of this year, and there is not yet a guarantee from the county whether that contract will be extended. And so the proposal is to augment those services and fund those services directly.\nSpeaker 10: In the city of Alameda, Alameda tenants have been the sink, the second highest users of this emergency financial assistance under the county contract. And it has been a great resource for keeping tenants in their homes and keeping tenants from becoming homeless.\nSpeaker 10: And that is a program that that Centro thinks that it can put to really good use in this upcoming year of of the contract. So that that's kind of a high level overview of what the recommendation is and what staff is recommending.\nSpeaker 10: I am happy to answer any questions after public comment.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any clarifying questions about the staff report? Okay. Hearing that we'll move to. But did you have something.\nSpeaker 10: Else to say? Sorry. And I did want to point out that Monique Berlanga, the directing attorney, and Teresa Gonzalez, the executive director of Central Legal, are here this evening and they are available to to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. Let's go to our public speakers, please.\nSpeaker 1: Terri Johansen and Kathryn Polley.\nSpeaker 8: You have to boil it down.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor and Council. I would once again like to commend this mayor and this council for everything that you've done for renters in Alameda. I am a renter and I'm speaking tonight as a renter. I do feel like the renters have been one of the most vulnerable in our community.\nSpeaker 2: And with the efforts of this mayor and council, we have done a lot to protect people and to keep them in their homes and to thereby reduce the homeless population. That's just escalating. I think these changes of of reaching out to more community members and to offering them more services, especially the assistance when they need it, I\nSpeaker 2: think is a is a great expansion of the protection and the parachute. If you're going to go sailing at 100 miles an hour, the parachute and the safety net that you all have provided. So I, I commend you all for all of the protections you have have afforded our renters and hope this continues in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Pike.\nSpeaker 5: I want to add my appreciation to Cherise. I think you all have been doing tremendous work on so many different levels regarding Central Ago. What we are hearing since Jessica's evictions came into effect is we are getting a lot more calls, a lot more questions, not just about habitability, but about buildings being sold.\nSpeaker 5: I feel that now that we have just cause protections, tenants seem more willing to come out and talk about it. And the next step is, if things are advancing or complicated, we will be doing more room for referrals to Centro Legal.\nSpeaker 5: So thank you for having this program in place. I feel like there's a lot of progress being made and it's going to be a tremendous help to the tenants there. The changes mentioned, I think, are smart. I know that a lot of Alameda residents excuse me, a lot of Alameda residents have drawn on that Alameda County money\nSpeaker 5: through central legal. So that is a very positive step and to make sure that that that is continued to keep people housed. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We have one more and one more speaker.\nSpeaker 1: Lana, is Sheena.\nSpeaker 0: Misery Sheena.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor and City Council. I also want to thank you for having this program in place. My father was the one who benefited from this program, and unfortunately he's not here. But if he were, he would have said the same thing.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. This program is very important. And now that the city made changes to the city laws to protect the tenants, it is crucial to have this help because the law will be meaningless if there is nobody to implement it.\nSpeaker 2: And one thing I want to say in favor of De La Rosa is our personal experience with them. First of all, they're very knowledgeable about the issues on the island. They know the ordinance and know what's going on and they are available.\nSpeaker 2: There are other places like, say, for example, illegal. They're very good, but they are overwhelmed. And today, the housing situation is such that all this housing services, advocacy groups, they are tremendously overwhelmed. And tenants on the island have a resource like De La Raza.\nSpeaker 2: Then they have that resource available to them. Sorry. And that's number one. Number two, is that having that program in place facilitates settlements. Because anytime I used to do pro-bono advocacy in San Francisco years ago, and my experience with that was any time a tenant shows up to a court house with a lawyer, then usually 90% of\nSpeaker 2: the time they woke up settling. And this is one of the things that we need. And with the crisis, with the homeless crisis driving people out of their home, we really need this kind of help. So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: And I hope that you support this program and this program will continue.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Ms.. Recine. Okay. That's all of our public speakers. I'm actually going to lead off because I was one of the ones, and then I'll turn it over to you. Councilmember Desai and I wrote a long email this morning to Debbie Potter, and you did get back to me this evening.\nSpeaker 0: I support in concept the program and the having an agreement with Centro Legal de la Raza. My problem is with some of the amendments. So we know from the scope of services and from what the reason that the council voted in 2018 to allocate a half a million dollars, $500,000 over three years, $166,666 each year to El\nSpeaker 0: Centro to the center. The was to provide legal services to low income tenants to reduce the risk of displacement. And certainly those of us who work often in the housing arena and working hard to combat our housing crisis know that the best way to address homelessness is not to let it happen in the first place, and that's\nSpeaker 0: why things like the emergency funds are so helpful. But my concern with these proposed changes are threefold. One of them is Centro Legal has come back and said essentially after the first year, you know, we just didn't reach as many people as we thought we would.\nSpeaker 0: So pay us the same amount of money while we reduce the number of legal consultations by 5%, the number of clients served by 25%, legal representation by 50%, and providing housing stabilization strategies by 33%. And there is a proposal to include, over the course of two years, $55,000 of city money for this emergency financial assistance that we\nSpeaker 0: we heard Ms.. Porter speak about, which has up till now been provided by county funds. But those funds look like they're going to go away in May of this year. So certainly good to have the ability to supplant those.\nSpeaker 0: I feel that whenever we're taking money from the general fund, we want to make sure that it's well spent. And as an attorney, not actively practicing now, but if I were bidding on a contract for services, I would be looking at the number of clients we expected to serve, the number of attorneys, paralegals, staff, time it takes\nSpeaker 0: . But now, with this reduction in still wanting to be paid the same amount, I I'm I'm uncomfortable with that. But another concern I had in reading your annual report is that Centro Legal has no Asian language proficiency. In fact, they stated that in their first year they learned from outreach that Alameda has a high.\nSpeaker 0: Relation high Asian population, many of whom are non-English speaking well around Alameda. It's a pretty well-known fact that our population is anywhere from 33%, maybe even higher. Asian Pacific Islanders. And I was surprised to read that Central. They didn't know that until they did their initial outreach.\nSpeaker 0: And then in the the annual report, it was stated that additional funding beyond current contract amounts would be required to conduct a needs assessment for those communities, the Asian Speaking Communities to determine best program designed to address their specific legal needs and elsewhere.\nSpeaker 0: It said in the report that. But, you know, we can probably just deal with them using a translator over the phone. That bothers me, because for English speaking and probably Spanish speaking clients, they would get a person to person consultation.\nSpeaker 0: But if you're Asian speaking, you're going to be talking over the phone with a translator. I just think you're very vulnerable, as are two tenant representative. And as mentioned, you're very vulnerable. And so we want to make sure we're giving you the best representation possible.\nSpeaker 0: My modification to this agreement would be okay if you're going to keep the $500,000 over three years, but you're telling us already you're serving less clients. I would expect central legal to bring in Asian speaking interpreters to actually I mean, who are trained to actually work with folks rather than saying, oh, you can just use our phone\nSpeaker 0: translation service, that that's unacceptable for me. And then the third concern I have is the clinic locations and hours are not helpful for working people and those with limited mobility. So in the staff report, we read that legal consultation services at Central Legal's location are just over the Fruitvale Bridge.\nSpeaker 0: And those services are provided again in the Fruitvale District every Tuesday at 9 a.m.. If you were on a weekly basis or once a month at Mastic, which is in Alameda from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.. Well, in my email to Ms..\nSpeaker 0: Potter, I said that formula is backwards. Central Legal should be in Alameda once a week. And I would propose I don't want to micromanage, but I would propose at a set location whether it's the first Tuesday, the month that mastic, the second Tuesday at our midpoint collaborative the third at the library that you should serve Alameda residents\nSpeaker 0: in Alameda because not everyone is able to hop on the bus there and get there. There are there are, you know, physical limitations sometimes. But also the fact that the clinics and the services are only offered weekday mornings is troublesome because for working people, you wouldn't be able to I mean, many working people would not be able\nSpeaker 0: to take time off to go and seek this legal consultation. And so, as I said, that, you know, legal representation is only effective if you can access it. So I and I know Ms.. Potter, when she responded, said that, well, they tried and they just didn't get much response at their clinics in Alameda, but now they're proposing\nSpeaker 0: to do more outreach. So I would say in that outreach, tell people that you'll be in Alameda every week. And secondly, it was stated that, well, you know, they do a lot of phone consultations and find that those are sufficient.\nSpeaker 0: Well, phone consultations for half a million dollars for three years, that that seems kind of steep to me. So I want to provide this legal representation, but I want it to be effective. And so, again, for the reasons that I've stated, unless we can make modifications, I can't support this in Councilmember de SAC.\nSpeaker 0: I know you also wanted to pull this item.\nSpeaker 6: Well, thank you. I just have some questions. Perhaps staff can respond or or the service provider. So my questions are as follows In what way does the service provider ensure that it is pursuing only those legal cases after examining both renter and land small landlords perspective?\nSpeaker 6: In other words, next question How does the service provider guard against situations where they are, where they are not getting the full picture from a client? I mean, what are what are the internal procedures in place? Policies, procedures that make sure that they get the full picture.\nSpeaker 10: So central legal. Their first recourse, essentially, or their first approach is to to talk with both the landlord and the tenant and see if they can negotiate a resolution and to not have that the issue at hand end up in court.\nSpeaker 10: And they did inform me that they have not yet initiated a single litigation against a single landlord in Alameda, but rather they've been very effective working to negotiate solutions without the need to the recourse of going to court so that as part of that process, there is a fact finding process where they are able to speak with\nSpeaker 10: both the landlord and the tenant and then evaluate the veracity of what both sides are saying. So that's their process, and they have not yet brought any litigation against any landlord.\nSpeaker 6: They have not brought any litigation against landlords, but they have written letters to landlords. Is that correct? On behalf of tenants?\nSpeaker 10: I'm. Yes, they yes, they have. And.\nSpeaker 0: You know, will it be necessary? Would it be helpful? Are you saying the same thing I was?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Council Mayor Ashcraft. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: So if you want to introduce yourself. Oh.\nSpeaker 1: Sorry. My name is Monique Berlanga. I'm the directing attorney of the tenants rights practice at Centro Legal de la Rosa. And I want to thank everybody for the questions. These are all very good questions, things that we've been examining internally as well in terms of how we are delivering services under the program.\nSpeaker 1: In response to your specific question about how do we make sure that.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, if you have internal procedures or policies that institutionalizing the fact finding phase? Sure. I am aware of some small landlords who just received a letter that kind of took their presumptive position that. The landlord was wrong. Yes.\nSpeaker 6: Without having. Really? Interviewed the landlord or gathered the facts.\nSpeaker 1: So I would say that there are there are different levels of services we provide. We often at our clinics provide consultation services. We can help tenants who may not be able to write letters themselves, write letters to their landlords.\nSpeaker 1: But that's different from when we enter into a legal representation. When we enter into a legal representation and retain a tenant for services, we're definitely going to investigate the facts before we agree to provide any type of litigation related or long, longer extended services.\nSpeaker 1: So I hope that answers your questions. But in a brief drop in clinic, often, you know, we don't have that opportunity.\nSpeaker 6: I think. The thing that I would encourage is that, um, perhaps as that you create internal policies and procedures that if you're communicating with whomever, that you indicate that this is not a leak, you know, this is not, as you said, a legal situation.\nSpeaker 6: Um, a so that when a landlord gets a letter, they understand that while it might come from, from your organization or with the assistance of staff from your organization, that there is a difference between. This is a legal letter that says, hey, you've done something wrong and we're going to try to fix it through the courts.\nSpeaker 6: And that there's a process by which it is clearly indicated that that this is. I know this is a non-legal or information gathering phase. Sure. Yeah. Um, because I have, I do know of landlords who have received letters and who felt like what you know.\nSpeaker 6: I think the bigger picture is they felt like they were the big picture. Their perspective was not taken into account. Yeah. Um, so, um. That that's what I would encourage. Is that, um. That you'd be more clear because, you know, there are small landlords in town for whom it is difficult to wage their own legal case.\nSpeaker 6: It's not like everyone has, you know, a bundle of money to pay lawyers. So I think a little sensitivity on that part is.\nSpeaker 1: So so one other thing I'd like to mention in terms of our model and and what we do for tenants, which kind of goes hand-in-hand with the modifications we're proposing tonight, is we really pride ourselves in intervening early before a situation gets to the point of eviction, which is why we are proposing a reduced number of eviction\nSpeaker 1: , defense representations and more informational tenant education outreach efforts. A lot of what I'm finding when I go to Mastic and I conduct these clinics is tenants coming in and saying, Can you help me interpret my lease? Or I'm starting to have this issue.\nSpeaker 1: How can I de-escalate this issue with my landlord? What are some options I may have? What are my rights? Their rights? And we're able to intervene early at that stage or refer them to the rent board for mediation or whatever it may be.\nSpeaker 1: So I would say that that's that's where we're trying to focus at this point, is more collaborative efforts. But then again, we do have duties to clients to to enforce their rights and to help them provide notice as provided by the law.\nSpeaker 1: So I hear I hear what you're saying. And we do take we are very, very careful before we enter into a full legal representation to make sure we invest all the facts, investigate all the facts. But it does put us in a little bit of a difficult situation when we do have to often take attendance words for\nSpeaker 1: what their experiences.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: So I see this woman. You would. Would you like. Are you also from Central Park?\nSpeaker 1: Because my colleagues are.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So is that where you're standing up to be supportive or did you want to speak? You know, if you're going to speak and please speak into the microphone and introduce yourself, please.\nSpeaker 2: Sure. I'm Katie Guimond.\nSpeaker 0: I'm going to need to look closer.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm Katie Guimond. I'm ah, research and policy analyst at Central Go. And I just wanted to make sure that I'm available for questions. I didn't have anything specific on this matter.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. And then I do have a question from Councilmember Vella.\nSpeaker 1: Do you think it's just to stay up or.\nSpeaker 0: I don't know. It depends on the question. Is it discretionary question?\nSpeaker 9: Both.\nSpeaker 0: So okay.\nSpeaker 9: So I hear my colleague's concern regarding the language issues I used to be when I started my legal career I worked in for a nonprofit law firm. I think that it's always difficult to find the balance between the informational sessions versus the, you know, the one on one client time.\nSpeaker 9: I am wondering if maybe there's a way to create some sort of program to do a by appointment in Alameda where you can schedule with the language line, that sort of thing, or get an interpreter available once you've made arrangements.\nSpeaker 9: And I think that that might meet the needs of, you know, having the drop in hours, but also having a space within that area or working with staff to find a space where you could have meetings in Alameda with clients so that they don't have to go off island with.\nSpeaker 0: With respect, if you're referring to my concern with an interpreter on the line, I know that that would not satisfy my my concerns. So I would like an in-person.\nSpeaker 9: Well, I'm saying that it would allow them. My question is whether they could make arrangements to allow sometimes you can't get an interpreter to physically come in depending on the language or the dialect or language. Sometimes you have to make arrangements to have a call in.\nSpeaker 9: But if there's a space, I think one of your other concerns was having, you know, accessibility for people in Alameda. And my question was, if there's a way to kind of carve out space for these one on one meetings, also potentially in Alameda where people can schedule, because I hear the concern also regarding the times, but sometimes\nSpeaker 9: it's a matter of making yourself available for a scheduled appointment. And I know people often don't like to go to the to the drop in hours because they don't know if they're going to have to wait to see somebody and that sort of thing.\nSpeaker 9: And so if there's a process that they can go about scheduling that and schedule it, perhaps here in Alameda as opposed to going to the offices, and they can make arrangements for any sort of language if they have a language preference, that sort of thing.\nSpeaker 9: And what that would look like, what you do for other contracts where you have language barriers.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think that's a great idea. I think so. Speaking of other contracts, we administer several different entities, placement contracts in other jurisdictions. And as this this contract is evolving, our other contracts are evolving similarly as well. Things start in pilot and as you learn to see a community's needs, you're often modifying as you go.\nSpeaker 1: I would I think that's a great idea. In terms of the appointments, I don't think it would be a great use of our resources to have weekly drop in clinics necessarily. I don't I think an appointment based system would work pretty well, particularly given the timelines we're dealing with.\nSpeaker 1: A three day notice is a tenant may not be able to wait till the next drop in clinic. And what do they do? They call us and that is what we end up often doing, is making an individual appointment with them or, you know, giving them the advice over phone.\nSpeaker 1: Or if a tenant has an unlawful detainer, they have a five day response time, you know, having a set day. There will always be tenants who need services in the interim. And I think we are definitely open to some to a model like that where we are doing phone consultations but then setting up blocks of time within\nSpeaker 1: Alameda to meet with tenants face to face where we can if we have, you know, a volunteer interpreter potentially or an interpreter, we hire in a certain dialect present, but if not, then we can use the language line.\nSpeaker 1: I wish we could have staff who speak every dialect and every language that's available in Alameda. I don't know. You know, we can we can reach out to our banks for clarification.\nSpeaker 0: I did not ask that. Oh, no.\nSpeaker 1: No, no. I know that.\nSpeaker 0: It was Chinese specifically. And I'm not asking for interpreters for every language spoken in Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: Even within Chinese, though, we find that there are many different dialects.\nSpeaker 0: I think my colleague had some good suggestions.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. I think that's something we're open to. And we, you know, we are also are open to talking with every council member about what their ideas might be for different locations, different sites, different groups. We can reach out to.\nSpeaker 1: We are. We're happy to spend as much time on the island as works for tenants. That's why we've proposed to outreach community engagement. We want people to know we're here or services are available. We'd like to come out to community groups and do outreach education workshops.\nSpeaker 1: Those type of services definitely broke into.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember villages to have the floor.\nSpeaker 9: And then a couple other things I think working with. We do have a tenants group working with them. I think it is important to have drop in some some drop in hours scheduled, maybe not every week, but coordinating with them.\nSpeaker 9: They have monthly meetings and things like that. So perhaps you can coordinate with them to get the word out about it or with the housing authority as well. I think it's helpful to have that available to folks. And then there is the other question I had is your materials make?\nSpeaker 9: Are they do we have them in some of the known languages here in Alameda that there have been requests, some of the standard informational letters or fax, getting it translated in to Mandarin or Cantonese or other dialects that we know.\nSpeaker 9: We have a large population with the need.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. We've in the budget modification attached to the annual report we have in excuse me, requested increased outreach materials funding so that we can contract for translation and.\nSpeaker 9: So that but that specific to getting translated materials and fake use.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. That that would be that would be a use of this.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. And then, you know, just and I know we have a diverse group of opinions up here. I certainly appreciate the fact that you're contracting with us to preserve to to provide a certain amount of advocacy for a specific group.\nSpeaker 9: And so sometimes that means sending out letters where you're acting as the representative of that individual, where they might feel like they don't have a voice. You're giving them that voice. And I think that's a very important role that you're playing.\nSpeaker 9: And that's personally why I'm very supportive of this contract and the services that are provided. I think it's it's necessary. And oftentimes it does bring people to the table to prevent further stress on on either side and make sure that everybody is abiding by the laws and ordinances that we've set forth in the protections to make sure\nSpeaker 9: that it's a level playing field. So I know that you've provided that service, and I thank you for that.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Who's next? Councilman Brody.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Again, thanks for providing the service. I just want to make sure we're clear that, you know, your services are legal services and they're governed by the business and professions code. Right? So attorneys are by nature and by law, you know, not the finder of fact.\nSpeaker 4: When there's a dispute in facts. And just because there's a dispute doesn't mean the landlord is right. So your job is to represent the tenants and be their advocate. And if there is a dispute, that could end up going to a court.\nSpeaker 4: So it's not the job of you all to decide, you know, who's right, who's wrong. It's to zealously zealously advocate for your client, right?\nSpeaker 1: That is correct. And we take that duty very seriously.\nSpeaker 4: So I just want to make sure nobody expects that if you go to get an advocate for you, that they're going to end up, you know, proving the the other side's position. So, I mean, I look at the numbers, what, 62.\nSpeaker 4: So if 14% were API, that's nine, right? So do we know the languages of these nine nine folks that we're classifying? Well, we serve 60 to 62 people. Right.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Are you an exhibit?\nSpeaker 4: I think I'm in the.\nSpeaker 0: Did you read the report? Okay.\nSpeaker 4: We served 60 to 60 legal consultations, five four scope representations, total of 62 and duplicated clients. 14% were API. It is that so that.\nSpeaker 1: I don't have those numbers in front of me in terms of language?\nSpeaker 4: I guess I'd be curious to know because I mean, are four big AAPI groups, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, and I think Korean is next. So I mean, there's not a tremendous number of languages that you need to have people available on.\nSpeaker 4: And it does kind of bother me that, you know, almost 10% of the folks that are four, 15%, one in seven that come to you, you know, may not speak the language. And that you know, I mean, when the mayor pointed it out, we're actually getting less for the same amount of money.\nSpeaker 4: And now we have to pay for this, in addition, which seems to be kind of a deficiency in the current arrangement, it seems to me that you might be able to work with us on that. And, you know, maybe, you know, on the second point, you know, maybe coming every week is not feasible for you.\nSpeaker 4: But, you know, there has to be something maybe in the middle. I mean, can you address some of the the things that the mayor had a concern on and maybe tell us some of those that you might be able to, you know, to help us with?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, but I am concerned about the language. I mean.\nSpeaker 1: We're looking those numbers up right now so we can tell you what percentage.\nSpeaker 0: And while you're looking those numbers up, I would just add I was making notes in the margin that I don't know. I mean, we could help connect you with members of our Asian API community. I'm thinking of Alice Ly Becher, a former community county supervisor who's very well besides being native born, you know, from Hong Kong herself\nSpeaker 0: . But she's, she's a fluent speaker and she's very tied in with the AAPI community. There are many others too, who because I just fear that there's the numbers you serve. But there might have even been more that had the need.\nSpeaker 0: But they didn't know if you didn't have materials in their languages. So I thank you, Councilmember Odie, for highlighting that.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, I mean, are, you know, one of our elected officials Filipino. Another one is is Chinese. There's the Asian Law Caucus. I mean, there's a number of resources that, you know, you could presumably find a translator that wouldn't charge, you know.\nSpeaker 4: Over the roof or whatever the term is?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, definitely. And I want to clarify that. I don't think it's been a problem for us in our service provision of providing services in LA, in other languages. My concern is I think there are communities who don't know about the availability of our services, which is where these types of connections which we hope that you all can\nSpeaker 1: help us with. And you know, as you mentioned, we do have many partner agencies who can help us with the translation of materials. But our number one concern has been is focusing our efforts into those communities in trying to, in a cultural, culturally responsive way of letting them know that there are rights that exist and that we\nSpeaker 1: are here for them. And, you know, this is a constant struggle we do in every community that we work with a finding where the most marginalized and vulnerable communities and how can we make inroads into reaching them. So, you know, we can provide you the information.\nSpeaker 1: But my concern is that people that haven't come to us. Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 4: Still, I mean.\nSpeaker 1: You want me to speak to the. Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 4: Some of the things that the may or may have. And I didn't hear you address that. Some of those could be resolved.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. So the decrease in deliverables, I will say when we designed this, our initial proposal to the city for this contract, we looked at it and we said, okay, one attorney, you know, some portion of a paralegal, what is the maximum caseload that one attorney can carry in terms of eviction, defense?\nSpeaker 1: I believe we proposed 40 reps because that's kind of the responsible caseload for an eviction defense attorney. In piloting the project, we've learned that that's not the primary need in Alameda, that the primary need that we've been seen is consultation services, no people wanting clarifications about the law, people not knowing what their rights are.\nSpeaker 1: So we've proposed to modify, to increase our efforts there to, you know, focus more on outreach, on the tenant education, on the consultation services, trying to make inroads within the community as opposed to having kind of an arbitrary number of eviction defense cases.\nSpeaker 1: We want to prevent evictions. We want to provide the whole spectrum of services, not just eviction, defense, when a case has gotten to the point where there is no amicable resolution without, you know, a judge intervening, which goes along with the EFA services as well, that, you know, helps prevent evictions.\nSpeaker 1: So I was.\nSpeaker 0: Like, no, I was just going to say, because you translate the acronym for people who don't know what that is, the EFA.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, emergency financial assistance. So so we're not really viewing this as offering fewer services. We're viewing this as modifying existing services to meet the needs that we are finding that the community is presenting, that showing us that they need.\nSpeaker 1: You know, if you want us to focus only on eviction defense, you know, we could potentially do that. But we're finding in all of all of the jurisdictions we're working in, that having the broader range of services is the best way to combat displacement.\nSpeaker 4: I think the to correct me if I'm wrong, Mayor, but I think the two items that the mayor raised were, you know, the language availability and having to pay for that. And then, you know, the hours that being not convenient for people who live here and may also add on on language.\nSpeaker 4: I know we have a lot of folks that, you know, from East Africa or that speak Arabic languages and that's that's a growing population. Yes. In our city. So we need to be cognizant of that, those languages as well.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. And, you know, again, we use our language line. It's not a perfect solution, but we do serve clients from all in. I think right now I just saw our most recent bill for our language line translation. I think we had maybe 15 different languages that we are actively providing services to clients not just in the city\nSpeaker 1: of Alameda but throughout central legal and it is effective in court. You know, there's been recent case law where the court must provide an interpreter in court proceedings. But interpretation is expensive, you know, to have in-person interpretation. But it is it is important.\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, again, we do have partnerships with other organizations where if if the need was presented, if we want to do a know your rights presentation and other language, we do have some partners we can draw upon to assist us with.\nSpeaker 1: But again, any any partners you can connect us with. Do you appreciated in terms of. Oh, sorry.\nSpeaker 4: And her answer. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: So we, we've, we've looked at the numbers for languages.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So I just wanted to share that of the people we've served.\nSpeaker 2: One person told us that they speak Chinese, Cantonese. Specifically, one person said.\nSpeaker 5: That they speak to speak Tagalog specifically.\nSpeaker 2: And the rest were English, French and Spanish with a few people who did not report the language.\nSpeaker 4: So it's for two. Maybe we shouldn't be built.\nSpeaker 2: The way.\nSpeaker 4: It seems if it's only two. Maybe we shouldn't be billed extra.\nSpeaker 1: But we're not. We're not. We're not building extra that we do. We? That was just part of the contract.\nSpeaker 0: Well, we haven't even agreed on what we're going to approve as far as funding for next year. So I you know what? I have got to wrap up really quickly. So you're going to say that the vice mayor would like to make his comments?\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to say, in terms of clinics and ours, you know, again, that that's a constant and we're open to suggestions or ideas. I think an appointment based system would be really great where we can do an initial intake by phone and set up an appointment based on the attendance hours, what works for them in the\nSpeaker 1: city of Alameda, which we we do. We are doing that right now. That wasn't highlighted in the report, but that is something we are actively doing. And we have evening clinics as well, which I have noticed that.\nSpeaker 0: Is that in the report?\nSpeaker 1: Where was that? Yeah, that's just something we do. We work actually with the law school. So we have UC.\nSpeaker 0: Berkeley and you have evening clinics in Oakland.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we do. And I'll tell you what, alameda tenants have been coming to this alameda me the hours.\nSpeaker 0: You know alameda tenants have been coming but you can't count the ones who didn't come. And Councilmember Odie referenced people from Middle Eastern Arabic speaking countries. Some of those women who are veiled will not get on a bus and go over to Oakland by themselves.\nSpeaker 0: And so it's part of being culturally sensitive. Let's hear from the vice mayor.\nSpeaker 7: I'm sorry. Thank you. So I actually before you before you leave, I just what I want to just clarify my my understanding when I look at your budget. So so you you had a you had a goal of a 125 connections last year.\nSpeaker 7: And now this year, we're we're going to we're going to drop that to 75. But ultimately, in the end, if I if I'm reading the report, right. You actually spoke to 62 people. Is that is that correct? So, so and the exact numbers aren't that important, but I just want to make sure that's that general understanding.\nSpeaker 1: That's the general budget.\nSpeaker 7: And so this revised budget, really what you're proposing here is that you're going to do more outreach and for less money going to legal representation, you're going to you're still going to you're assuming you're still going to provide services to a greater number of people.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. There will be more touches. We think the impact will actually be greater as we're out there giving presentations, providing that knowledge into the community, empowering the community to provide that knowledge to their, you know, friends, neighbors, family.\nSpeaker 1: So we do think that this will be actually a much greater impact by reallocate reallocating families.\nSpeaker 7: So I appreciate the thoughtfulness that goes that went into this. So when I've been in your shoes talking to boards of diocese and these are never phone conversations, so thank you for your for your willingness to engage. My question is because I because I do agree that I mean, you know, when you live in a town where\nSpeaker 7: the ethnic makeup is 30% Chinese-American and somebody who and we've all knocked on doors as we're going around, knows that there are a lot of households out there that that there is knowing it's not even just, you know, low, low English proficiency, but but zero.\nSpeaker 7: I do think that that's a that's an issue that I would want to make sure is clarified if and as we move forward, how that is going to be handled both from the is, you know, I guess my question is this is this enough money for outreach, quite honestly, because it feels like printing some fliers and then\nSpeaker 7: dropping them off in some places and hoping people hoping people find them. So I might actually be interested in seeing if there's a slightly larger outreach in education budget that could could be used to reach some of the communities that were not current that that you've highlighted, that you're concerned you're not reaching into.\nSpeaker 7: Again, I don't know what that right number is or in this may be it, I'm open to that. But I would also like to better understand how, to my colleagues point that if and when we move forward with with the contract, how we can utilize city resources and whatever else to have onsite in city meetings.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. I mean one of the good things about living next door to a really large city is that you have access to lots of resources that you might not if everybody was just the size of Alameda. On the other hand, sometimes there's this expectation that everybody leave the island in order to get services.\nSpeaker 7: And I am sensitive to especially the populations for. I can do here may not be the populations that have the flexibility, the time and whatnot to necessarily get in a car, drive and jump on a bus and spend 30 or 40 minutes traveling to a meeting.\nSpeaker 7: So I'd like to kind of see that addressed as we're moving forward in this conversation.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Vela.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, I think there are, uh, you know, if there's a way to partner with some of these surrounding organizations, there are some that are actually active. They're based in Oakland as well, but active here in Alameda. Filipino Advocates for justice.\nSpeaker 9: Um, Asian Health Services. And some of those groups where, where perhaps it's not doing the drop in hours or something like that but actually doing a know your rights event co-sponsored with those groups where you could have breakouts in various languages and doing something like that where you're pooling resources to make it more effective and doing it\nSpeaker 9: maybe once or twice a year just to give the updates if there have been any updates to let people know what your work is. I'd love to see something like that. Co-sponsored with Alameda Renters and these other groups that are operating here.\nSpeaker 9: I think as much as we can pool resources among the different nonprofits that are doing the work, as well as our legal nonprofits and our our activists to help get the word out. Then you have multiple people in multiple platforms helping with the publicity.\nSpeaker 9: It's not then an added budget expense and we can really coalesce and um, rather than duplicate. So I think that, you know, if we could see that and have some plan for that, whether from a staff perspective, I know that that's something that you and Debbie mentioned in your kind of report.\nSpeaker 9: There was an email that you sent clearing up some information. And I know we've talked about, uh, these sort of possibilities.\nSpeaker 10: And the perfect example of a know your rights that you co-sponsor is that I have referred when the Chans office wants to do a know your rights event in April, and I have referred them to Centro Legal to combine their forces and do something collaboratively.\nSpeaker 10: So we're not having multiple events so we can get more bang. And the housing authority is working with central legal for a know your rights forum. So I think that that is exactly the kind of thing that's being looked at as part of the outreach and the enhanced outreach budget.\nSpeaker 10: Um.\nSpeaker 0: Well, finish your sentence and then I want to, I want to suggest a modification.\nSpeaker 10: And then I was, I was going to, if I, if it's helpful, I was just going to summarize a few of the key points that I heard this evening, which was on the interpret the interpreters. So, um, Centro uses the language, Centro uses a language line which we don't pay extra for.\nSpeaker 10: I mean that's part of the services and the language line. They, they do meet with a person in the room and then the translators on the phone so that they're with the client in person. And what I've heard is that the council might like to see a model where there is an initial contact and then a one\nSpeaker 10: on one appointment is scheduled with a time, and then arrangements can be made for an interpreter to be physically present. If, um, if that's what's warranted as a next step. I mean, it sounded like that there's either the language line or to try to identify somebody who could do interpretation.\nSpeaker 0: Um, so I'll answer that. Although Council, I'm going to need your indulgence for about two more minutes when my time runs out. But, um, I, I have maybe softened on an interpreter, but if the, uh, the tenant says no, I would really like someone in person translating, I think that that person could be found.\nSpeaker 0: What I can't agree to is adding to this budget to provide more services, more outreach. Translation I think this budget has all that is needed. I know I read that whether you could do more outreach, but it would take more funds.\nSpeaker 0: You have stated that they're doing less legal representation, more tenant education. So that's non attorney time. So I would I, I think this this contract is plenty rich in terms of compensation, especially for touching fewer clients.\nSpeaker 10: Asking for any additional compensation that the recommendation is a revised work scope with the existing the existing budget. So there's no request for additional funding from the city council.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Notwithstanding what was said in the in the annual report.\nSpeaker 10: Well, the point that was being made in the annual report was less about the translation and more about the cultural competency. And if the central legal were to do a deeper. I've around cultural competency that that was an exercise that would require additional funding.\nSpeaker 10: And what they said was, however, and we're not asking for that additional funding, they were just pointing out that cultural competency is a different than just translation services. But what they're proposing is, as they do their their more robust outreach, they will be able to do some of what was being suggested tonight, such as reaching out to\nSpeaker 10: Alice Liberty or the and other folks who may have connections in the community that can help with that, but not for any additional funding for that exercise. That's not what's being requested. There is no additional funding being requested this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Council Could I have a motion to give me maximum three more minutes on this item?\nSpeaker 3: Um. Sure.\nSpeaker 6: Um. Yeah, I'll move that second.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All in favor. I. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, um, I. So I take a few steps back, and again, I am stunned that an organization as well-regarded, incompetent as Central ago did not know that working in Alameda would involve working with Asian speaking, non-English speaking Asian clients.\nSpeaker 0: And so now they're having to do, you know, go back and make up for lost time. I'm saying that should have been part of the first phase in year one. So whatever they need to do to increase that cultural competency and there have been great suggestions from my colleagues about you don't have to reinvent the wheel.\nSpeaker 0: Asian health services, other you know organizations partner with other groups. But I, I feel strongly about they should do more to to do more robust outreach. But again, within that same funding envelope. And I if I'm going to vote for this proposal, I do need to see more time spent in Alameda for all the reasons that have\nSpeaker 0: been articulated and the um, because again, at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is keep people from being displaced. And we're hearing from our tenants that now that tenants have a little more confidence or less fear to come forward and complain about habitability requirements.\nSpeaker 0: It's already a struggle. People are working two and three jobs just to pay the rent. Let's not make them take time out of their busy days to go to Oakland. I think you know, you're serving Alameda. I think you should spend as much time here as you're spending in Oakland at clinics.\nSpeaker 0: My thoughts? Okay. Who's next? Councilmember. Councilmember Diaz.\nSpeaker 6: Well, thank you. I just want to make two points. First is, from a practical standpoint, the reason why we want to have more services provided in the city of Alameda is because from a practical perspective, we don't know if our if our funds.\nSpeaker 6: Are paying for clients from San Leandro or Oakland when they go to your Oakland office. So at least if we're in Alameda, we know that they're Alameda. So we know something about the way in which our funds are being expended.\nSpeaker 6: Perhaps there's an answer to that that you have. But but that's that's one of the practical reasons why if we're going to fund services, that the services ought to be in the city in which, you know, the funds are coming from.\nSpeaker 6: Um, the second point is, um, I certainly, uh, I want to hear more and maybe it's not for tonight, but I just want to hear more about how your organization can guard against situations, um, where you're not getting the full picture.\nSpeaker 6: Um, and. I certainly heard the. Part that you said that there's a clear distinction between legal representation, in which case you have to, as Councilmember Brody says, defend your client to the fullest. But I think I also heard that before you get to this phase of legal representation, there's also some information gathering that that that you do\nSpeaker 6: with the tenants. I think it's at that point where I would want somehow that that, you know, you also are gathering information from the small, small mom and pop landlords. That's that's who I represent. And, you know, those are the perspectives that I hear and.\nSpeaker 6: And you know, maybe in this day and age, you know, it's not a politically correct thing to say, but it is what it is. And so that's that's what I want to hear, is that that there is a process by which, you know, you have internal procedures in place that that ensure that that you're doing all that\nSpeaker 6: you can in following your procedures to get the full picture of a certain situation before you take it to the next stage of of it being some kind of legal issue, at which point in time, yes. Council Member Ody is correct.\nSpeaker 6: You have to represent, you know, your client as best as possible. Not all landlords are right. Not all renters are right. You know, there's a gray area somewhere in there. And as professionals, you know, we have to figure that out.\nSpeaker 6: So those are the two points that I want to say. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 4: I guess my question was to our councilman. What, if anything, can we modify in this agreement here? Like could we require a check in in 90 days to, you know, implement some of the things that we've we've asked about?\nSpeaker 4: Could we require, you know, 5050 splitting of the of the meetings or, you know, as the mayor or flip it, like the mayor suggested? I mean, what type of things can we modify?\nSpeaker 7: These are all things you can modify, though the other side might have a saying yes or no as to whether or not they'll sign the agreement.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I'm not comfortable waiting a year. Yeah, but maybe there's some middle ground. I don't know.\nSpeaker 10: I mean, the item is before you tonight, and you can amend the work scope and just just I just want to address Councilmember De Sykes at one point. We absolutely know that we are serving and paying for services delivered to Alameda residents.\nSpeaker 10: There is an intake form that is done and the central league, our work, our contract requires reporting. So we absolutely know that we are serving Alameda residents with the city's money. So I just want to make that clear.\nSpeaker 6: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: I was. I was. It sounds like the council might be interested in having the work scope further amended, which if we get directions, staff can do that so that we pursue the one on one appointments. And that I think what we heard from Central Legal this evening is that the the the drop in clinics more than monthly\nSpeaker 10: at mastic the know your rights events which are already contemplated are effective but that the one on one appointments may be the most effective way to to work with Alameda residents so that when they can be scheduled and they can have a block of time and they can schedule one on one appointments, we can absolutely provide space\nSpeaker 10: for them to conduct these meetings. We I think we should be able to do that. And then I think we can modify the work scope to include that. And then I would you had suggested 90 days. I was thinking about a six month check in back to the council where we could communicate, you know, a six month\nSpeaker 10: report check in. We can either do it as an off agenda or if the council wanted a presentation from from central legal staff, we could do that. And that might be a way to track how things are going and that they would be doing more outreach and work with translating materials.\nSpeaker 10: Those kinds of things are already contemplated in the work scope. And so it sounded like one of the bigger changes was the one on one appointments here in Alameda.\nSpeaker 0: I would add to that, I think I've said it a couple of times. I want to see more robust outreach to non-English speaking communities and then, uh, let's see, did someone else want to chime in? I just lost my train of thought to try and get it back at Councilmember Avila.\nSpeaker 9: I think one other thing is with or we're doing a rent registry right now, so we're going to have addresses and more information, correct. I think somehow utilizing that information or in anything that goes out from the city, including Centro's information on it, that has to happen.\nSpeaker 9: I know there was a delay in having that happen before, and that was on our end. And I would like to make sure that that that that is part and parcel of it, that we are also doing our our job and getting the word out about these services being available.\nSpeaker 9: And that not only do we note that that Centro is a resource for for tenants to call, but also that that perhaps we do that in a couple of different languages so that are our tenants who speak different languages and especially languages that we know are prevalent, that they can call Centro and that language services are available\nSpeaker 9: to them. So they will get they will get legal services that this is not only for English speakers. So I think that that's something that we can do on our end. And certainly we need to make sure that we're doing that because that's part of the outreach.\nSpeaker 0: And I'll just say there's already a line item in in their annual report for outreach and marketing. So this should be well within the scope. And what I was also going to add is this emergency financial assistance recommending $25,000 allocation the year in year to 30,000 in year three.\nSpeaker 0: But yet in the first year of the grant city of Alameda, tenants received $47,462 in CFA grants. So why would we then reduce that amount? This is where I would feel more comfortable just holding back some of the $166,666 for the city.\nSpeaker 0: And to say, okay, you do the you find out who needs this assistance, let us know what you'd have to do anyway, because we have to have ultimate approval authority. And I mean, why would we only authorize 25,000 in emergency assistance this year when last year they allocated 47,000, I would say is the need getting smaller?\nSpeaker 10: Well, last year out of this budget there was no right.\nSpeaker 0: I understand. Understood, Ms.. Potter. But again, it's the same money we're talking the same funds that we're talking about. Emergency financial assistance to keep people from slipping through the cracks. So it's looking like the city will take that over now.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm just saying, why allocate less for this next year than was spent last year?\nSpeaker 10: Well, because they've been because tenants have been able to access the county money from last November through May. The county contracts still in place. It's an augmentation now. And then if the county contract is not renewed come May, then there's the 30,000 for the following year.\nSpeaker 10: And it may be that one of the report backs to council can be what the county did with the contract in May to understand whether or not it's going to be a reduction or not.\nSpeaker 0: I'm just reading from the annual report that says in the first year of the grant city of Alameda, tenants have received 47,000, etc..\nSpeaker 10: That's correct. That's correct. From the County Funds Council.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 4: Let me try something. So I'd like to move approval of the item with the understanding that staff comes back in four months because six months is on break. And then so that really that means seven. So I don't think that's feasible with hearing all of the concerns that were raised today and then seeing if you could come\nSpeaker 4: up with some agreement or modifications we could consider at that point to amend the agreement based on, you know, further research and negotiation.\nSpeaker 9: If needed.\nSpeaker 4: If needed. I don't know. We'll see if that fly. You can always.\nSpeaker 0: Extend that again.\nSpeaker 4: Well, rather than change anything today, just come back in four months, because I'm sure everyone has heard everything that we've we've talked about. And then see if you can come up with different ways to amend the agreement in four months time that could help alleviate all these concerns.\nSpeaker 4: At no additional cost.\nSpeaker 0: So based on council comments. Right?\nSpeaker 4: Right. Yeah. I mean, that way we keep moving forward and we don't let it lapse or anything, but we get a sooner reaction to some of these these things because I don't like the idea of amending from the dais, but, you know, I'm open to it if my colleagues have something firm that they they think the legal\nSpeaker 4: services group can agree to, but just it's emotion. We'll see what.\nSpeaker 2: Happens.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We've had a motion. We've had a second discussion. Vice Mayor That's right.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. So my biggest concern is four months isn't very much in time to get something here. We're going to have two months of data. I don't I don't I much as I don't want to wait until September, I really think that we should give them till September so that we can actually get some time, some time for\nSpeaker 7: them to to do something that they're going to be turning around. A report starting in about a month without time to have actually done anything that we're that we're looking to address. I'm fully supportive with the general motion.\nSpeaker 7: I would also just want to give a little bit, make sure that there's clarity on what things we're reporting back on, which in terms of in my mind is the in language, the how meetings are going and how outreach is happening and how successful that outreach has been.\nSpeaker 0: So are you making a substitute motion?\nSpeaker 7: I guess I'm asking Councilmember Ody if he would be willing to accept that.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, maybe if we can get it before the end of July. But, you know, it shouldn't take that much time to report out on the outreach efforts that are being done. It shouldn't take that much time to figure out which languages they need, you know, supported.\nSpeaker 4: And I mean, I don't know. I guess that's a question. So whether, you know, we give away X hundred dollars for assistance or we have, you know, 30 cases versus 60, I agree that we're not going to have that data, but I think there were some specific points that were raised specifically around meeting in Alameda and interpreting\nSpeaker 4: services that I don't know if you need data on. But, you know.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Bell is going to clear this all that person.\nSpeaker 2: No pressure.\nSpeaker 0: No pressure.\nSpeaker 9: I'm wondering if we can get an off if if we can get an off agenda report back before before in four months and then have an A have this come back on agenda after the break in September. And I think that that that will keep us on track to have that report in time for September.\nSpeaker 9: And if there's if there's updates or information that comes in, it'll be it'll come in in time. For a report from staff to be developed, and it will give us an opportunity to weigh in. And if there's more information that we're seeking or more details.\nSpeaker 9: So perhaps it's we can amend the motion to have an off off off agenda report back and in four months and then have this agenda is to come back to us in September.\nSpeaker 0: How does that sound to you? Councilor Roby Okay, so we have a modified motion that's been seconded.\nSpeaker 9: Second.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yes. Sunbae, can somebody say goodbye? Councilmember Vel, any further discussion? All in favor. I oppose. Abstain, said the motion passes four in favor and one abstention.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone, for all the information you provided. At this time, we're going to take about a ten minute break. We will resume at 830. Thank you. 30. Okay. The council meeting is resuming. I get that.\nSpeaker 0: And you know.\nSpeaker 3: What?\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay. I'll take that. Okay, so we are resuming, but we're going to do a little bit of. How could I ask everyone? Everyone. There would be everyone to please. If you wanted to have a conversation, do it in the hall.\nSpeaker 0: This council meeting is in session. Hello, everyone. Okay, so I've had a few requests about looking at the agenda. Order. Um, Madam Clerk, can you tell us you have the speaker's lists for all the different items that are still to be heard, which is to say the entire regular agenda.\nSpeaker 0: And it's 830. Which of them has the most speakers?\nSpeaker 1: Six, eight.\nSpeaker 0: Six, eight has five. Okay, well, why don't we start at the top of the alphabet with six? And then, um. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Then six P has one and six F has two.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, that's pretty similar. So. Okay. We are starting with 6a6am and three. Oh, you know what? I want to I want to just announcement or just keep coming up, ladies. Um, I did have a request from staff that not all staff were agreeable to merging items six B and 60.\nSpeaker 0: So we are. And merging them and they going to be heard separately. See, that was easy. Okay. Six. Wow. Is this right? What? You guys are doing that to me again?\nSpeaker 5: No, it's it's normal place. And usually it's.\nSpeaker 1: It may just be a brighter group, right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. To. Okay. Okay. So could I have a motion, please, to separate items B and C, back to being individual items. So move second a second by a council member. Decide all in favor I any oppose.\nSpeaker 0: Abstain. Okay. Okay. So I misspoke. Powder. I am just going to have to move my chair because I can't stand that light. But keep talking.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. Good evening, mayor and council members. I'm Debbie Potter, the development director. And I am delighted to be here tonight to talk about the MRU with the East Bay Regional Park District for the Northwest Territory Regional Shoreline. And I'm even more delighted to have my coconspirator here, Amy Wooldridge, the Rec and Park Director.\n",

The King County District Court, Northeast Division currently has two openings to the incumbents being appointed to the Superior Court by Governor Inslee. Pursuant to King County Code, I instructed staff to coordinate interviews with all of the eligible applicants, and that subcommittee consisted of myself\nSpeaker 0: and council members Baldacci, Dombrowski and Lambert. We conducted six interviews on July 8th and July 10th and are recommending three candidates as finalists to be interviewed today. The county code requires a procedural motion to select the finalists to be interviewed, and I wish to call on Councilmember Dombrowski to make that motion now.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. It's my pleasure to move that. The King County Council take up the appointment of the two open seats for Northeast District Court, and that we consider the recommendations of the select committee that you mentioned Kevin Peck, Jill Kling and Michelle Gilson, and conduct interviews here today and make a recommendation to the\nSpeaker 0: full council if that is the motion you were looking for. I believe it. I believe in fact it is. Discussion Council Member Gossett.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to ask Councilmember DEMBOSKY does that mean we are filling two positions today or just one?\nSpeaker 0: Two positions?\nSpeaker 2: Oh, thank you for that clarification.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, I see no further discussion. All those in favor, please say I oppose. Nay, the ayes have it. Thank you. Today, the full committee will interview. The three finalists, will provide about 15 minutes for each finalist. And until the finalists are before the panel for the interview, I'm asking that they be sequestered in the actually in a\nSpeaker 0: conference room in the administrative offices of the council.

Everybody has, right?\nSpeaker 2: No.\nSpeaker 1: It's not.\nSpeaker 2: Appropriate for you to be.\nSpeaker 0: Against it.\nSpeaker 2: You have to apply their word. But they have made it their personal. Yeah. I mean, you know.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. All right.\nSpeaker 2: We gotta go.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah I've been feeling you know I we have not pre assigned who asks the questions and will be making that up as we go along. So let me begin actually by welcoming Kevin Peck and ask you to briefly introduce yourself.\nSpeaker 0: Describe your background and why you'd like to serve it as a district court judge.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, and thank you for the honor to address the entire council today. My name is Kevin Peck. I served as a trailer in King County for the past 36 years, and I've been honored to serve as a pro-tem judge in the King County District Court for the past 29 years.\nSpeaker 3: At age 14, I began working at McDonald's in Chicago. I graduated high school a semester early and took a position as a law clerk in a Chicago law firm where in my spare time I would go to the courthouses in Chicago, either the federal court or state court and watch trials.\nSpeaker 3: And it was there at the age of 17, I began my love and fascination for our legal system. I moved to Seattle 41 years ago, where I worked in the shipyards and as a vendor at the kingdom in order to help pay for law school and graduating from law school.\nSpeaker 3: I immediately took the job full time as a public defender in King County for three years, where a guardian significant trial experience in representing indigent clients and communities of color. I also advocated for caseload standards for public defenders that that based on the overwhelming caseload we were being presented with to make sure that being provide adequate representation\nSpeaker 3: . After I was served as a public defender, I was then hired as in-house counsel to the hotel and restaurant employees. I served in that position for two years where I negotiated collective bargaining agreements for fair and sustainable wages, safe working conditions, and work to try and eliminate sexual harassment, which was rampant in that industry.\nSpeaker 3: I subsequently went into private practice where I've now been for 31 years, where I continue to represent indigent defendants in federal court, criminal proceedings, and continue to practice employment law representing over 200 individuals in employment matters based on discrimination of race, sex, national origin, religion, disability and sexual orientation.\nSpeaker 3: I've been honored in that position to also sue a case all the way through the U.S. Supreme Court, a criminal case where the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a statute based on free speech. I've come up with some ideas.\nSpeaker 3: I started serving as a pro tem judge in the district court 29 years ago. Over the past 29 years, I've made it over the time.\nSpeaker 0: It was until just a second ago.\nSpeaker 3: Over the past 29 years, I've presided over hundreds and hundreds of proceedings, criminal cases, civil cases, trials, jury trials, every type of case that comes before a district court judge. There's not a day that I filled in as a district court judge that I haven't relished and love the opportunity.\nSpeaker 3: I find the work intellectually stimulating, and if I had my choice, I would do this work every day. The rest of my life, the lawyers that appear before me, the lawyers that appear before me advise me. They feel respect.\nSpeaker 3: It's okay.\nSpeaker 0: I'm sorry. Oh, pardon us.\nSpeaker 3: No, that's okay. Over the past 29 years, until the end, as a district court judge, the lawyers that have appeared before me advised me they feel listened to, respected. They appreciate. I get to the heart of the matter quickly and I have good judicial temperament.\nSpeaker 3: Two years ago, in the lobby of this courthouse, a lawyer stopped me and said he had appeared before me a month before on a motion hearing in Shoreline District Court. He said he lost the motion, but he wanted me to know my decision was well-reasoned.\nSpeaker 3: I didn't know this lawyer, he said. He wanted me to know my decision was well-reasoned and he was uplifted when I announced the decision. He said, You should run for judicial office. We need more judges like you. Three years ago, a claimant appeared before me in District Court on what's called a tow hearing, trying to get reimbursement\nSpeaker 3: , alleging his car had been illegally towed by a property owner. I showed him the statute and said the way the statutes written, I couldn't order reimbursement for him. But I said, here's the copy of the statute. You can go in the back of the courtroom and when you're ready, I'll recall the case and we can discuss it\nSpeaker 3: further. When he came to the front of the courtroom, he said, You're right, the way the statutes are, you can't order reimbursement. But I want you to know this is real justice and I really appreciate this opportunity. So those are some of the stories to people who've lost their hearings in my courtroom, but still appreciated the type\nSpeaker 3: of justice that I was able to provide. And I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We have a volunteer to ask the second question. Councilmember up the grove. Yeah. You're making me put my old man glasses on. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. Thanks for being here. Thank you. You touched on this very briefly in your introductory comments, but maybe you could flesh it out.\nSpeaker 0: Could you describe your understanding of the racial inequities in our justice system and our judicial system? And describe how you've worked to address these issues in your career and how you could seek to address them in a position as a permanent district court judge.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Thank you for the question. Do I feel sad that there such a racial inequality in our justice system? As I said, I've dedicated a good part of my life to pursuing discrimination, so it's not esoteric to me.\nSpeaker 3: I deal with it every day, people in the workplace being treated differently based on race or gender. But I also see it in the criminal justice system. The communities of color are well, overrepresented, unfortunately, in the criminal justice system.\nSpeaker 3: And that's actually why I'm honored by my reading by the Latino Bar Association, exceptionally well-qualified and by the Lawrenceville or Mars Bar Association, exceptionally well-qualified, because I think they recognize the work I've been doing on behalf of communities of color over the last 36 years.\nSpeaker 3: And I think we can do a lot to change and reduce the inequities in the criminal justice system. Actually, some of some of you, if it's okay, if I pass out the.\nSpeaker 0: Call, do it for you. My cousin. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: What I've come up with is based on my experience of 29 years as a pro tem judge and 36 years practicing in in court is a trial lawyer. I've come up with some ideas and some of the ideas I think would help reduce the racial inequity in the district court system.\nSpeaker 3: So I quickly go through those ideas. The first pages ideas and the second piece pages, a criminal case timeline. I know some of you are familiar with criminal case timelines. Others perhaps it would be a help to. But some of the ideas I have to reduce the racial inequity we have way, way too many people miss court\nSpeaker 3: hearings and warrants are put out for them. You know, when a warrant is put out for an individual, not only is that judicial time and public defender time and prosecutor time and police time and share of time, you know, then once they're taken into custody, they have to stay in jail potentially overnight and then come back and\nSpeaker 3: be brought before the court the next day. Transportation time, it's mass cost to the district court system. So and what it does to the individuals is the individual that is has to stay in jail overnight or perhaps longer.\nSpeaker 3: They can't support their family because they're in jail. They might lose their job. They might have to miss school. It can create havoc for persons. And at least based on my experience, I see it affects persons of color to a greater degree.\nSpeaker 3: And I think what we need to do is work to reduce warrants. So my first idea is we put out text notification to individuals the day before their court hearing. Too many people miss court hearings. As I explained to the subcommittee, when I need medication, Costco sends me a reminder.\nSpeaker 3: I press the text. It's it's time. Yes, I want to renew my medication. And then they tell me when it's ready so we can send that same notification out. And as part of the notification, I also put in my ideas that we can describe the type of court hearing and again, my representation of persons of color for\nSpeaker 3: 36 years and interdependence. A lot of people don't come to court because they're afraid to come to court or they don't understand and they think they're going to end up in custody and they can't afford to lose their job.\nSpeaker 3: They can't afford to lose their housing. They need to take care of their children. So I think we can reduce those inequities. And you can help describe what happens in an arraignment hearing, simply a plea of guilty or not guilty.\nSpeaker 3: You can describe what happens at a pretrial hearing so it can reduce those inequities. But the second you can have agreed pretrial continuances in an arraignment hearing, as I said, I've been protesting for 29 years and on an increasing, frequently based, frequent basis, I think the court steps know that I'm willing to do the work.\nSpeaker 3: I can get the job done in an efficient manner and provide the type of justice that's needed. And I'm willing to drop what I have to show up to protest. So when you go to an arraignment hearing, there's 60 to 80 people be arraigned after the arraignment hearing based on the timeline.\nSpeaker 3: The second piece of paper is the pretrial hearing. What happens at the pretrial hearing? You either have worked out some arrangement to resolve the case or there's a plea or the case is going to get set over to another pretrial.\nSpeaker 3: So 80% of the cases are set over at the pretrial to another pretrial. So all that happens. It's a minute hearing people come before me. I asked them, did you go through this speedy trial with the attorney? And you understand it's a knowing decision, volunteer decision, educated decision.\nSpeaker 3: You understand by signing this, the prosecutor is going to have until March 2020 to try you. Is that okay? Yes. They signed a waiver. We presented to the clerk. I said, I want to see the clerk. We can give you another hearing in six weeks.\nSpeaker 3: So that whole hearing was completely unnecessary. If based on the person's criminal history, which hopefully there is none. But if there is criminal history, if they've shown up for court in the past, you could agree with the prosecutor, the defense attorney and the prosecutor can agree in advance that if the person files the waiver seven days in\nSpeaker 3: advance of the hearing, that hearing can be stricken. You can have hundreds of less hearings in King County district courts every week. It's completely unnecessary. What does it do? It would save persons that are low wage earners, potentially persons of color from having to come to court.\nSpeaker 3: Transportation costs, child care costs, missed a day of work. So if you could equal some of that, create equality in some of those situations, approximately 30% of the people that appear in an arraignment hearing are eligible for what's called a deferred prosecution, meaning if they enter into alcohol treatment or drug treatment or some kind of behavioral health\nSpeaker 3: treatment, they can have their charge put off for five years. And then if they're successful, it can be ultimately dismissed. So in the arraignment hearing, again, when there's 60 or 80 people in front of me, we can in advance, if people are willing to do so voluntarily, come and tell their story.\nSpeaker 3: You know, I was arrested seven years ago on a DUI or whatever the case. I went through a deferred prosecution. I went through treatment. I successfully completed it in my life is much better now. My case was dismissed.\nSpeaker 3: You know, it can be a two minute recitation or five minute recitation voluntarily. And hopefully the audience is going to listen to that person much more. They're going to listen to a public defender, which they're not going to the public defender's not going to talk to him about it until the next pretrial, which is six weeks later\nSpeaker 3: . And then they might talk to him about it for 10 minutes. And then when they think, oh, that's a possibility. No, said it over another six weeks to get the alcohol evaluation. So if you get people thinking about a deferred prosecution earlier, you can save again and reduce these unnecessary retrials.\nSpeaker 3: And it also reduces the cost, the hidden costs, I call it. Again, I was public defender years. It reduces the hidden cost of public defense increase because you don't have these unnecessary pretrial hearings occurring again in terms of the equity.\nSpeaker 3: You increase the use of video hearings in the district court and there is a lot of video hearings occurring, but there can be more. Most of the defendants are held at the facility, the score facility it's sitting in, if I'm protesting in Bellevue, Redmond, or whatever the case may be.\nSpeaker 3: It's a video period. A person was taken into custody on a warrant. Then you determine whether or not they should be released and you can introduce the inequities in the court system. Like one of the last times I filled in, there was a gentleman that it was a video hearing.\nSpeaker 3: I was in Bellevue based on his history of failure to appear for court. He probably should potentially receive some type of bail. But the prosecutor and the defendant was pleading. He said, Your Honor, I just got out of jail.\nSpeaker 3: I just got out of prison. 90 days ago, I served a three year sentence. I now have a job. I know I have a place to stay. So do you know how hard it was for me to find that job because he was an African-American gentleman?\nSpeaker 3: He said, you know how hard it was for me to be able to find that job. He said, I miss my court hearing. I know I missed my ordering, but my job, me, if I wasn't there for the first 60 days, I would lose my job.\nSpeaker 3: So I think those type of situations, inequities have to be taken into consideration. The prosecutor wanted thousands of dollars of bail. I let the man out, no bail so he could keep his job and hopefully appear for court.\nSpeaker 3: So I think a judge in district court has that capacity. The same thing that just the defendant's out of custody. Instead of someone coming, driving all the way from Auburn to Redmond to appear at a pretrial for a few minutes, why not have a hotspot or head of a video location where they can appear for court?\nSpeaker 3: And then again, it could save transportation time. Unnecessary missing of work, child care, unnecessary expenses. We can equalize these things. I think these are just some of the ideas. And I should point out, when I in my pursuit of this position, I met with the prosecutor.\nSpeaker 0: Please continue.\nSpeaker 3: In my pursuit of this position, I met with prosecutor Dan Theodor burg, went over my ideas with him. He said if you get a chance to hear from the county council, go over these ideas with them. He liked my ideas.\nSpeaker 3: He endorsed me for the position. I also met with the county executive. He said When I went over my ideas, he said, Where have you been? We want you for this position. He endorsed me for the position. And he said, We need to keep this dialog open.\nSpeaker 3: So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And with the next question, Councilmember Caldwell's.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Peck. Handling a mistake can reveal a lot about a person's temperament. And I would like you to tell us about a time you've made a mistake and how you realized you made that and what made you change your mind and did you correct yourself or reverse your mistake?\nSpeaker 1: So kind of a lot of questions there, but I hope you get the idea.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: I think it's a very good question. I think based on my experience as a pro tem, I've learned to be very, very careful before I make a decision. And I've learned to listen carefully to the evidence. If I need further research on a matter, I can ask the parties to present further testimony, either oral argument or research\nSpeaker 3: , or I can take a break, go do research myself. So my experience as a pro tem and in one of the most difficult cases I had filling in as a pro tem is the individual was it was approximately a year ago now that I tried the case in individuals driving in Bellevue West toward the sun it right\nSpeaker 3: at sunset they turn left into an intersection. And fortunately there was an elderly person in the intersection. They hit the person and unfortunately the person died. There would have been extensive pretrial in litigation in that case, I wasn't part of.\nSpeaker 3: I was called again. I think it was an early morning call. Can you fill in today? First Judge So-and-so, whatever the case may be. I was called it turned out to be a three day trial. Extensive exhibits, very, very difficult decision to determine whether or not the person was negligent.\nSpeaker 3: But I learned through that decision. I took my time. I went through all the exhibits. I finally came to the decision. And in response to your question, whatever decision I made, I think I wasn't going to be satisfied with because it was such a difficult decision.\nSpeaker 3: And I found the person was not negligent. They were they were found responsible for a lesser traffic infection, but not the higher traffic infraction. But what I learned from that is just to be very, very careful. And if I do make a mistake, which I hope we don't, but there's an appeal process available to people.\nSpeaker 3: But I always am very, very careful about my decisions. And I think actually that the matter was so difficult that the sitting judge actually apologized to me. When they came back, they said, oh, I didn't mean for you to get stuck with that statute.\nSpeaker 3: I said, No, I appreciate it. I do. I really appreciate the opportunity to experience.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Opportunity for follow up questions from members. I would ask I would ask you to provide your closing remarks.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And thank you again for this opportunity. I sincerely appreciate it. Over the past 36 years as a trial lawyer, I've represented hundreds of individuals in either criminal cases, civil cases or employment cases. And what I've done over those past 36 years is try to find justice for individuals and improve their lives.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm proud that I've been able to help people improve their lives. When we leave court, either as a citizen or a lawyer or a litigant, what is it we want? We want to feel respected, listened to and received a decision that's fair and impartial based on the facts and the law.\nSpeaker 3: And I think, based on my experience filling in as a pro tem judge, I provided that type of justice. The mission statement for the King County District Court is to provide fair, understandable and efficient justice in a dignified and respectful manner.\nSpeaker 3: And I respectfully submit that that's what I've been able to do over the past 29 years. As I said, I love the position. I love filling in as a pro tem judge based on the fact that I love the interaction with the individuals in court.\nSpeaker 3: Many people call the district court the People's Court, and they call it the People's Court, because I think if if the odds are a person has interaction with a court in King County, it's most likely the district court.\nSpeaker 3: In addition to serving as a pro tem judge. I've represented communities of color, indigent, indigent clients for the past 36 years. And again, I think it's based on my experience representing those communities. Again, the Latino Bar Association and the Laura miller Bar Association gave me the highest rankings, exceptionally well-qualified.\nSpeaker 3: And I think it's because I work with those communities. I understand the unfortunate issues that they face and I work to try and improve some of their lives. In specific, I've worked with individuals that are unfortunately afflicted with addiction to either heroin or methamphetamine or.\nSpeaker 0: Alcohol or.\nSpeaker 3: Cocaine. I work with individuals that are homeless, that don't have a job, don't have any family support, have little education, may have little hope for the future. And what I've been able to do on behalf of those individuals is provide them hope and work, work with them to get through the system and hopefully get out of the\nSpeaker 3: criminal justice system or the cycle of the criminal justice system in getting individuals out of the cycle of the criminal justice system. It not only helps that individual, but it helps all the citizens of King County. It betters King County for all of us.\nSpeaker 3: So if I had the opportunity to serve as a pro tem judge, I would love the opportunity. As I said, I don't I'm not applying for this job as a stepping stone. I love the district court. I love the People's Court.\nSpeaker 3: And if I'm so honored to be selected for the position, I plan on staying. If I had the opportunity, I would do this work every day the rest of my life. I relish this position. This position is a dream job to me.\nSpeaker 3: Essentially, I have 29 years of intermittent on the job experience in this position, and I would like to be able to continue to put my skills and ability to work on behalf of all the citizens of King County.\nSpeaker 3: I commit to you that I will work as personally humanly possible, work as hard as humanly possible on behalf of the citizens of King County. I want to better the citizens of King County. I want to work collaboratively with you and the judiciary to improve the judiciary and the administration of justice.\nSpeaker 3: I've been honored not only to be endorsed by and what's interesting is 36 years of practicing criminal law on one side of the aisle. But I've been endorsed by King County Prosecutor, Dance Theater Bird, and I've also been endorsed by the former U.S. attorney, Jenny Durkan.\nSpeaker 3: So I think it shows these people understand my ability to be fair, honest and impartial. We had a discussion the other day in the subcommittee, and I think those are in practice law. Know that you as a lawyer, you can file what's called an affidavit to have one judge removed if you don't think hypothetically you're going to\nSpeaker 3: get a fair trial. So over my 29 years of filling in as a pro tem judge, only once ever did someone file what's called an affidavit to have a different judge. And that was only because that case was tied into essentially 29 other cases.\nSpeaker 3: And they wanted a sitting judge to be there over the next few months to be able to resolve the matter. So I'm proud that the lawyers that appear before me, as I said, they like my judicial temperament. They feel respected, they appreciate I get to the heart of the matter quickly.\nSpeaker 3: And I would relish again the opportunity to be able to continue to provide justice on behalf of the citizens working on your behalf. And I would work tirelessly not only in the courtroom, not only in the courthouse, but I'm willing to commit to work and go out in the.\nSpeaker 3: Community and publicly speak. Tell individuals. Tell public school events, community meetings. If you're gracious enough to invite me to a constituent meeting 10 minutes as a guest speaker, I'm happy to speak on what new laws there are out in the community.\nSpeaker 3: My example is I said to the subcommittees, there's distracted driving laws that have been in effect for two years now. 30% of the drivers, unfortunately, suffering fatalities in King County, in the state of Washington on the road, it's now related to distracted driving.\nSpeaker 3: 25% of all serious accidents are related to distracted driving. So I'm willing to go to community meetings and at least as a judge say this is what the law is. Just so you know, this is what's legal under this is what's illegal.\nSpeaker 3: And if each person there just tells one or two of their friends, the word can spread and hopefully we can save lives or protect lives. So thank you very, very much for this opportunity. I sincerely appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. We'll take a moment to invite in. GMs Clang, clang, clang, clang.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you very.\nSpeaker 0: Much. Thank you. Swing back. Yes. Good afternoon. Welcome back.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I would ask you to please introduce yourself, describe your background and why you would like to be a district court judge.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you very much, Councilmember, and to all the honorable council members, thank you all for being here today. I'm exciting. And I want to start just by thanking you all for all of the hard work you do for King County and all of the time and commitment that I know that you've spent in making this really important\nSpeaker 6: decision today. It's very much appreciated by myself as a citizen of King County, as well as the candidate I. As you know, my name is Jill Kling, and I am King County District Court Judge Pro-Tem. I have been a Judge Pro-Tem on King County District Court for five years.\nSpeaker 6: For three years that has been my primary occupation, as well as many of the municipal courts in King County, including Renton, Issaquah and Taboola Municipal Courts. My primary employer is the King County District Court. Last year I covered for 23 of the 25 current and recently elevated King County District Court judges.\nSpeaker 6: I have sat in every branch in King County except for Vacation Island, which I understand only meets once a month. So they haven't got me out there yet. And and I love I love the job is a job that I feel is very close to my heart and it's something that I love going and doing every day\nSpeaker 6: . I have also lived on the East Side since 1996. My husband and I have raised three children on the East Side and sent them to the public schools there. And my community involvement has been heavily centered in the East Side, particularly in Bellevue and in Issaquah.\nSpeaker 6: I worked for 13 plus years as a prosecutor for the city of Redmond, so my work experience is on the east side in King County District Court in Redmond previous to being a judge. So my experience and involvement on the East Side and my qualifications for this position with respect to my experience, speak for themselves the many\nSpeaker 6: judges, staff members and community members that have written letters on my behalf. I am humbled by the support that they've given me and they have they speak for me as well as the King County pro-tem. I've been exposed to this job far beyond the day to day operations of the courtroom.\nSpeaker 6: While my position involves working in the courtroom. I am there behind the scenes, in the chambers and in the hallways nearly every day. And I've had the opportunity to be exposed to all of the facets of what it means to be a King County District Court judge.\nSpeaker 6: The judges and staff in King County are some of the hardest working people I know, and they work tirelessly to improve and maintain the quality, accessibility and efficiency of justice in King County. I have spent many afternoons talking to Judge Finkle in Redmond about the therapeutic courts, particularly mental health court, which is his passion, and the new\nSpeaker 6: community court, which we've just begun in Redmond, and the workings of those and the benefits that we're seeing from those therapeutic courts I cover for Judge Chapman in Seattle on Thursdays when the Case Management Committee meets in his chambers and they are about to roll out a new electronic case management system that will make us essentially paperless\nSpeaker 6: and frankly catch us up to many of the municipal courts that I work for that are already completely paperless. And I sit as a fly on the wall in those committees and listen to how they operate. I have also discussed with Judge York in Auburn the importance of a stronger district court representation in the District and Municipal\nSpeaker 6: Court Judges Association, and is something that I would be very interested in contributing to. So I understand the multifaceted nature of the job of King County District Court Judge, and I am yearning for the ability to make a larger contribution to King County.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Everyone here for the second question. Councilmember Gossett.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Jill, for being willing to move forward in a very competitive position. I have a question that deals with you, as requested of you, that you describe your understanding of racial inequalities in our judicial system.\nSpeaker 2: And we'd also like for you to talk a little bit about how you might have worked to address racial inequality or race related issues in your career, even if it's in other arenas. And then lastly, how would you seek to address some of the issues relative to racial disproportionality as it may exist in the district court?\nSpeaker 6: There's a lot of questions that I'm going to address each of them, so I hope you'll be patient with me. Councilmember Gossett, first of all, it's good to see you again. I thank you for meeting with me last month.\nSpeaker 6: And and I had a nice time chatting with you then. And I hope that I can expand on some of the things that I told you then about these issues. First of all, we're very fortunate that in King County there is no shortage of conversation about access to justice, about implicit biases, about racial disparities in the criminal\nSpeaker 6: justice system. It is a topic that is widely and vigorously discussed, and there are ample opportunities to go to workshops and go work in committees, read articles and learn about what the issues are and how we can possibly contribute to solving them.\nSpeaker 6: There is certainly a disparity in our criminal justice system and it has many causes as a criminal justice system as a whole, that the racial possible racial biases, the implicit biases can come in at every level, starting with who gets arrested and why they get arrested to who the prosecutor charges with the crime and what crime they\nSpeaker 6: charge them with, to how that case then plays out in court to then ultimately what sentence, if any, is imposed in that case. So this is an issue and just in the criminal justice system that needs to be attacked at many different levels, not in the courtroom, and it needs to be addressed holistically, which is why the\nSpeaker 6: conversations need to keep happening between all of the players. Beyond that, there are further social issues that are that these these criminal justice issues are rooted in other social issues that need to be addressed as well. And so there's many, many players that need to come together in community to solve what is a continuing problem in the\nSpeaker 6: in the criminal justice system. As a judge, I have some abilities to affect the outcome of cases in my courtroom. I have the ability and I'll just give one example, because there are several. One of the big things that we're all talking about right now is who's on a jury, who gets picked to be on a jury\nSpeaker 6: and who gets thrown off of a jury and whoever even gets called to be on the jury. And when they are called, who shows up for jury service? And the the factors are many. But the result is we do not have enough diversity on our juries, and it is affecting the outcome of cases in negative ways.\nSpeaker 6: Recently, in the last few years, great work has been done in this area. There was a symposium at the Temple of Justice in Olympia that discussed this issue, and it resulted in the Washington Supreme Court justices passing g r 37, which changes greatly the way that we select juries in our state.\nSpeaker 6: And it has helped judges it has given judges some tools that we can use to make sure that candidates for being on a jury are not being dismissed improperly. And it is more power than judges had previously. So that is one thing that I take very seriously and have looked into.\nSpeaker 6: I also recently read an article in Northwest Lawyer magazine about the social sciences of a juror who says that they can be fair, even though they've had an experience in the past that makes them feel, you know, biased and this social science.\nSpeaker 6: A study discussed. When a person says, even though this happened to me, I can still be fair in this trial. The question is, can they really and will they really be fair? And our attitudes are changing about that.\nSpeaker 6: And the way I approach that situation in the courtroom as a judge is changing because of the changing awareness and social sciences that are happening in our community. So one of the things that I'm doing is trying to stay educated, trying to talk to as many people I can read as much as I can learn as much\nSpeaker 6: as I can, so that I can apply these concepts in my courtroom to make sure we get the most fair outcomes possible. You also asked what I am doing in my community to address issues of racial disparity and race relations.\nSpeaker 6: My community service is focused primarily outside of my profession. And at first blush, it may appear that my community involvement has little relation to my work, my career. I believe that's not true. My community involvement focuses on trying to reach young people of disparate communities before I ever have to see that in the courtroom.\nSpeaker 6: And that is how I believe it's related primarily. My work right now is with Village Theater in Issaquah. I'm on the board there and a primary mission that we have is arts, education and outreach to underserved communities. Last year we reached over 40,000 young people.\nSpeaker 6: One third of that programing was free or subsidized. And the purpose is to expose young people of underserved communities to the arts and arts education, which studies have shown result in positive community outcomes and less kids ever happening to see me in the courtroom.\nSpeaker 6: So that's something I'm very passionate about. I also serve on the Equity Diversity and Inclusion Committee at Village Theater, where we are trying to identify barriers that exist in getting more diversity in the arts, both on our board, our patrons on our stage, and the people who support us, identifying those barriers and figuring out how to break\nSpeaker 6: them down. And I think that those themes really cross over into many different societal areas, including our criminal justice system, a barrier in one areas, often a barrier in the other. So I bring my education and experience from that field to my work as a judge.\nSpeaker 6: And in that way, I think it's very relevant.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. Third question.\nSpeaker 6: What's up.\nSpeaker 0: Council member Carl Wells.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms.. Kling, how people handle a mistake can tell a lot about their temperament. And we'd like to have you tell us about a mistake you've made and how you realized you made that mistake and what made you change your mind.\nSpeaker 1: And did you correct yourself or reverse your mistake? Kind of a lot of questions. Yeah, there.\nSpeaker 6: But now I appreciate that question. Obviously, I do make mistakes and the struggle with being a prosecutor or a judge is that a lot of what my job is about is making judgments. So there's legal mistakes where you think the law is one thing and then you made a mistake and it's something else.\nSpeaker 6: And that's a little bit easier to identify and correct. And then what you think might have been a mistake in judgment. And so as a prosecutor, I had the luxury of speaking to juries after jury trials. And win or lose, I always took that opportunity to have a conversation with the jury about how they perceived the case\nSpeaker 6: that I had put on. And it taught me a lot about my judgment, my perceptions and theirs. And I learned a lot about how everybody might not see things the way that I see them. And I needed to be aware of that and learn from that.\nSpeaker 6: So there were times when I would have particular cases and the outcome would result in a way that I was concerned that I made a mistake in judgment. And in those times, I would talk to as many people as I could that would have some perspective on that situation that would be different than mine and try to\nSpeaker 6: learn what that perspective was so that I wouldn't make that same mistake in judgment again. Now I have a similar issue. Being a judge, I have to make judgment calls every day, and I don't know if I'm making a mistake or not.\nSpeaker 6: But being able to question that regularly is important. I did have a situation come up recently or I made a ruling in a case it was just about a month ago. So I need to be careful because I think the case is still pending.\nSpeaker 6: So I don't want to say too much specifically, but what happened was it was a motion to suppress evidence. And I made a ruling. And after I made the ruling, but before we left the courtroom, I had a moment where I was not confident that I had made the legally correct ruling.\nSpeaker 6: And what I did was I called the case back up. We went back on the record and I said to the attorneys, I'm having a moment, and I'm not 100% confident that I've made a correct ruling. I'd like to invite both of you to further brief this issue.\nSpeaker 6: And if you would like and so we can talk about it further, because I'd like to reexamine that decision that I've made. So I wanted to make sure that when I had that moment of not being confident that everybody had an opportunity to think about this a little bit more.\nSpeaker 6: And in criminal court, it is extremely rare for a judge to take a case under advisement. I have done it. Nobody likes it very much. It takes time. It means everyone has to come back to court. The attorneys want an answer because they want to be able to move on with their case.\nSpeaker 6: So it's not great, though I have done it. But in this case I didn't because I gave instead I gave the attorneys the choice if they wanted to bring that back before me and further argue it. So that's one way that I handled what was a potential mistake.\nSpeaker 6: I have not been appealed as far as I know, so I don't know of any specific legal mistakes that I have made. But if I truly made a ruling that was adverse to a part of the party and in particular adverse to a defendant that I later learned was an incorrect legal decision, I would undoubtedly have to\nSpeaker 6: make a suicide motion to reconsider, reconsider that. I would give the attorneys an opportunity to come back in and argue some more before I changed my ruling, because I don't think it would be appropriate for me to just go back into chambers.\nSpeaker 6: Guilt. You know what? I think I changed my mind and give everybody another shot at it, but I would take affirmative action to correct the mistake. I would never let a ruling lie that I felt was adverse to a defendant.\nSpeaker 6: That was incorrect.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I don't know if other questions come to mind about the group. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks for being here. I've enjoyed listening. I was not one of them on the interview panel. I've had the opportunity to get to know everyone.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 0: As well. So I was going to ask you to focus very much on your professional career. And I wanted to ask more of a personal question just to get to know you. Growing up in, you know, early in your life, maybe you could speak to any experiences that were formative and helping shape your values.\nSpeaker 0: And then secondly, people, you know, those are two very kind of different things. But were there moments in your life or experiences you had growing up that have shaped that particularly stand out as sort of shaping who you think you are as a person and the values you bring to life and as well as what individuals in\nSpeaker 0: your life have and how have they shaped your values.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Thank you for that question. So I grew up in a middle class, primarily white neighborhood in the East Bay of California. I did not have a very diverse upbringing. We were pretty homogenous group out there in Alameda County.\nSpeaker 6: And I went through life pretty comfortable. I had a family that was a whole family that never that never broke up in any way. My parents are still married after 62 years. I think it is now. They are still married.\nSpeaker 6: And and I and I had it, I'm going to say pretty easy. And the most formative times for me was when I started law school. And when I went to law school, I went to King Hall, which is named after Martin Luther King at UC Davis.\nSpeaker 6: And that is where I started getting the most exposure to different people and different ideas. And it was a good time to get it because it was in an environment where people were thoughtful, they were passionate, they were smart, and they wanted to talk about these issues.\nSpeaker 6: And I really started forming a lot of my feelings and opinions about the world and people and who I was throughout law school when I went to law school. I will admittedly tell you that I at 18 years old, I decided I was going to go to law school and I didn't know why I was going to\nSpeaker 6: law school. It just seemed like I would like it. It would be good at it. I was I liked to talk. You might have noticed, you know, I was a talker. And so it seemed like a good fit for me.\nSpeaker 6: And it wasn't until I got to law school and I started meeting people and speaking with people that it really started forming who I was as a person. And now, looking back, that's not surprising when you're 18 to 22 years old.\nSpeaker 6: And I now have kids that are 21 and 24 years old, and I get it, you haven't formed that quite yet. So I started meeting people who are particularly influential in my life, and I would say that many of them were women and they were women who were strong women in the legal community who introduced me to\nSpeaker 6: opportunity. At that time we were doing pretty well. I think we were about one in four attorneys were women. So it was still we're still in the minority, but I wasn't the only one. And I had significant role models that were women.\nSpeaker 6: And I had one internship as a young woman in law school with a private attorney who had her own practice in Davis, California. And she really empowered me to believe that I could do this and that I could be good at it and that I could live in what was still primarily a man's world.\nSpeaker 6: And then I had an internship with the Sacramento Prosecutors Office, and in that job, many of my supervisors were women. Many of the people in power there were women. And I worked in the domestic violence unit, and I was an intern and I wasn't a graduate of law school.\nSpeaker 6: And so my duties were limited. And what I primarily did was was provided support to victims and witnesses in domestic violence cases. So I would walk them through the process and help them understand what was going to happen, sit with them and talk with them about their stories.\nSpeaker 6: And that was the the day that I understood why I had gone to law school. Everything happens for a reason, and I hadn't figured out what it was yet, but that that internship woke me up to why I was meant to be there.\nSpeaker 6: So I did go on then to get my dream job, which was at the Alameda County Prosecutor's Office in Oakland, was one of the best respected. Prosecutor's offices in the country. And I was so fortunate to get to work there.\nSpeaker 6: There again, I had fantastic role models. My direct supervisor is now the elected district attorney in Alameda County. She's a fabulous woman. Fun fact. One of the women that started with me just a year apart, one year older than me was Kamala Harris.\nSpeaker 6: And we worked together for many years at the prosecutor's office. So so those were really special times. And I was surrounded by very strong, dynamic women who were able to teach me how to be not a prosecutor that goes for a conviction, but a prosecutor that seeks out justice.\nSpeaker 6: And one of the reasons that Alameda County was so respected is the diversity that we had on our team of prosecutors and the perspectives that we all brought. I also had the opportunity to work in Oakland for six years as a young, white, skinny prosecutor who did not come from that world at all.\nSpeaker 6: But I lived in it and I worked. I didn't literally live in it. I lived that world of Oakland, California. They were my witnesses. They were my victims. They were my defendants. And I learned so much about people during those six years and people who come from different places than I have since I've gotten to Washington.\nSpeaker 6: Some of my greatest influences have been the women who serve on the bench, particularly in King County, who have mentored me and encouraged me to seek this appointment. And it's those women who have told me that I can do this, that I am good at this, and that I am well suited for it, and that I should\nSpeaker 6: put myself out there to try to do it. So so I would say those would be my greatest influences are a combination of fabulous women. And of course, my mother, who had her first baby at 18 and her and me at 27 and I was the third by 21, she had two babies and she did a two\nSpeaker 6: year community college stint to become a dental hygienist. She had a loving and supportive husband. As they told you, they've been married 62 years. And and she also, of course, always through my life, was one who told me that I could do anything but maybe don't get pregnant when I'm 18 like that.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Our last question would be an opportunity for you to provide any closing remarks.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: I will.\nSpeaker 6: All right.\nSpeaker 1: So by now.\nSpeaker 6: I think most of you probably know a lot about me.\nSpeaker 1: A lot more.\nSpeaker 6: Than a lot of my friends do. Probably you've heard about you've read my application, you've heard from me, you've heard from judges who I'm so humbled by the letters that they have written on my behalf. I believe that you've heard from staff that I work with.\nSpeaker 6: You've heard from ratings committees, you heard from community members. So you know a lot about me, what I do, who I am. So I would like to just leave you with some bullet points of why I think I'm uniquely qualified for this appointment.\nSpeaker 6: I would like to return to the theme that this is a very multifaceted job, and I have a breadth and depth of experience that I think fits well in the job of 15 years in the King County District Court, both as an advocate and as a judge.\nSpeaker 6: I have strong connections with the East Side communities. Bellevue was my home. Redmon was my workplace. I worked for the city of Redmond, and in that capacity I worked on committees. And Redmond is one of King County District Court's clients, if you will.\nSpeaker 6: They were they contract for that service. And so as an employee of Redmond, I sat on committees with the King County District Court representatives and with the mayor's representatives and with representatives from the prosecutor's office and other places in the city.\nSpeaker 6: And we work together to find solutions to issues that would come up. And we worked together to figure out how to King County and Redmond, the city of Redmond, would work together. So I have experience with that. I have relationships there, and I understand the complexity of that relationship.\nSpeaker 6: I understand budgeting. I worked in Redmond with the Budgeting by Priorities Initiative. Every year we had a cut where in the prosecutor's office 20% sounds like a lot, but 20% of our work force was cut when we had two full time and one part time prosecutor and the part time job that cut and that's an extreme cut\nSpeaker 6: . When you now go to only two full time prosecutors, it was myself and Larry and. And we figured out how to make it work and we had to revise our budget and we had to work with the mayor and his committee on figuring out how that was going to work.\nSpeaker 6: I went through the lean process in Redmond where we went through each department and figured out how we could work more efficiently to save money. As president of Village Theater, which I will start my term as president elect in September and then followed by a three year term as the president of that organization.\nSpeaker 6: Not only will I lead 30 very diverse board members, but I will oversee a $14.4 million budget which our board sets and approves and enforces every year. So I and arts are notoriously underfunded, so I understand doing more with less.\nSpeaker 6: I understand budget cuts and I understand finding creative solutions to budget issues. So I want you to understand that I am obviously qualified to do the courtroom work. I do the courtroom work every day and the judges that I work or who have spoken on my behalf and made that clear.\nSpeaker 6: But I want you to know that I'm also qualified, prepared and eager to do all the other aspects of the job of King County District Court judge. And not only am I prepared and qualified, but I'm excited. I hope that you will decide to appoint me to this position, and I will have so much more to contribute\nSpeaker 6: as a full time sitting judge.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 6: All right.\nSpeaker 0: We appreciate it.\nSpeaker 6: We do it.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, everyone, so much. All right.\nSpeaker 0: It was a brief pause as we wait. Michelle Goldston, who? If you let me go here.\nSpeaker 2: All right.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Let's see what.\nSpeaker 0: Kids yours.\nSpeaker 1: First. Your second.\nSpeaker 5: The second one in there? Yep.\nSpeaker 0: Our third one. Good luck.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: First to discussion. Welcome. I'll start off with the first question, and that is to ask you to briefly introduce yourself. Describe your background and why you'd like to be a district judge. All right.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Kent County Council members. My name is Michelle Gelfand. I am a Bothell, the municipal court judge. Can you hear me okay, Councilman? About that? Thank you. Being a judge enables me to make a difference in people's lives.\nSpeaker 1: I am seeking the King County District Court position because King County is at the forefront of innovative restorative justice programs such as community court, mental health court and Veterans Court. Those programs make a difference and they are a solution.\nSpeaker 1: And I want to be a part of the solution by bringing my skills, experience and dedication and commitment to improving justice. My legal experience began in King County as a special deputy prosecuting attorney. I then was hired by Snohomish County Prosecutor's Office.\nSpeaker 1: I was a prosecutor in the criminal division for four years, and then I was in the civil division for three years as a mental health prosecutor. During that time, I also was a pro tem for three years, and in 2010 I was appointed to the Berkeley Municipal Court bench as the sole judge.\nSpeaker 1: I have been there for nine and a half years and I have presided over approximately 35,000 cases, 45 jury trials and hundreds of motion. In addition, I also am in charge of the management and operation of the court.\nSpeaker 1: I manage a court team and they are an amazing court team of seven and I operate $1,000,000 annual budget. I also believe truly that a good judge is not only in the courtroom, but is in our community and in our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 1: And I have volunteered thousands of hours in local elementary, middle school and high schools teaching civics. And I also saw a need when I was very early on the bench that we needed a ball for youth court. And I created the Bubble Youth Court.\nSpeaker 1: I created a bottle probation department, as well as assisted in establishing a mental health court in Snohomish County. I have a track record of leadership. I am the President elect at this time of the District Municipal Court Judges Association.\nSpeaker 1: That association is composed of 200 of my colleagues, fellow judges, and I am slated to be the President next year. I want to make a difference in our community, and I hope to be on the Austin 16 bench of King County District Court, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Question two. Councilmember Gossett.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Michelle, for being willing to go through these grueling interviews and going out and getting community support. I had the opportunity to read many, many letters of support that you've gotten and you got them early on.\nSpeaker 2: That was significant. Interesting to me. But I'd like for you to describe your understanding of racial inequities or the way in which racial injustice or injustice works in our judicial system. And you can determine whether or not you think it works.\nSpeaker 2: And then secondly, I'd like to know if you've worked on issues, on cases in your career relative to conflicts based on race and class. And then lastly, how would you seek to address issues related to race or class inequities if they should arise and the district court that you have that you preside over?\nSpeaker 1: All right. First of all, I think the first question is racial inequities and racial injustice. Injustice.\nSpeaker 2: And I don't think racial inequities exist.\nSpeaker 1: No, I'm not going to correct you. Unfortunately, they do exist. And there, as we know, that our system penalizes, I believe, people of color and low income because of the incarceration rates that we see in our county pretrial.\nSpeaker 1: And so what I'd like to do is how would I address those issues? I've addressed them in Bothell as well under the as we've seen from the Gender and Justice Commission. And the study that they have completed is that I believe that we have 14,000 people sitting in jail, 16, 500 awaiting trial.\nSpeaker 1: And that just does not correlate with the presumption of innocence. This is pretrial. And we know that the people that are incarcerated are much higher numbers of people of color and poverty. And I think that as a judge, to address those issues, you have to be questioning the prosecutor.\nSpeaker 1: I'm constantly questioning our prosecutors on 3.2, and that's the criminal rule when the jurisdiction and why you cannot hold or release somebody. And I think that as a judge, that's how that's one of the things that you can do to address that issue.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that we have to do better and that we can say I think that the the I know that it's stated in the article that you could say save up to $12 million by releasing people pretrial.\nSpeaker 1: Now, of course, you have to keep into consideration the public safety aspect as well. And so that is what I do every day is weighing public safety with personal liberty. Thank you. You're welcome.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Caldwell's.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Michel. Judge Gilson, rather. Welcome. Thank you. And so again, how an individual handles a mistake can reveal a lot about that person's temperament. So we'd appreciate it if you could tell us at a time in which you've made a mistake and how you recognize that, how you handled it.\nSpeaker 1: Did you correct yourself or reverse the mistake or just give us a feel for how you handle have handled that or would handle. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Definitely over my legal career and as a judge, I've made mistakes.\nSpeaker 1: We are not infallible. We are not perfect. And I think that what we have to do is absolutely recognize the mistake and correct it. And a judge does that either by making having the parties come back and change their ruling.\nSpeaker 1: But I can't give you a specific example of something that I did on a sentencing. And I had a judge. Woman in front of me who was in custody. And I truly believe that that in a district in and use of a court and as a municipal court setting as the People's Court, it is the judge's job\nSpeaker 1: to try to get somebody to change behavior. And you're always looking for the sweet spot as a judge. How much time do you do you have to give jail time? Is there a different is there a least restrictive alternative that you can give to get them to change behavior?\nSpeaker 1: So I had a gentleman in front of me. I he had substantial criminal history. I gave him a high end sentence. And you could tell it had completely deflated him and he stopped listening. And I believe the sentence was on a Friday.\nSpeaker 1: I thought about it all weekend, and I had him brought back. I had a discussion with him, dialog with him. He had a he didn't have enough time to really tell me what had brought those issues in his life.\nSpeaker 1: And so we created a plan. And so I said, I want you to do, you know, get treatment. I want you to do this. I want you to do this. I'm going to see you in 30 days. If it's not done, then we're going to start with a 60 days jail.\nSpeaker 1: You're welcome. Thank you. Councilmember Cool.\nSpeaker 0: Are there any follow up questions that I would ask you to share, any closing remarks?\nSpeaker 1: I just want to just briefly as well to follow up on Councilmember Goss's question as well. So I think that we truly we really need to look at our least restrictive alternatives that we now have, which is the SCRAM bracelet, the GPS, DV unit, those sorts of things to keep people out of custody and keep our community\nSpeaker 1: safe. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, again, I want to thank council members for having me here this afternoon. As I stated, I would really like to be appointed to the King County District Court because I have a desire to make a positive difference in people's lives.\nSpeaker 1: And I think as a judge, you have an extreme amount of power to either make a positive difference or a negative difference. I have nine years of judicial experience plus three years of protesting. I have created innovative programs, and I have a track record of leadership.\nSpeaker 1: I have been acknowledged by my peers from Snohomish County as winning judge of the year, from Washington woman lawyers. I by winning the Vanguard Award or being given the Vanguard Award and also am on the Legal Education Flame of Democracy Award.\nSpeaker 1: These awards reaffirm that what I'm doing in the community is making a difference and inspires me to do more. I am passionate. I have a strong work ethic. I am dedicated to improve our justice system, and I would be honored to be appointed to the King County District Bench, which it is such an esteemed bench.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll now invite the first two interviewees to join us. And why is it the committee's desire to have a few minutes in executive session then before we actually invite them into the room, will excuse everyone from the room.\nSpeaker 0: And to do that, we will have executive session under CW 4231 ten. The committee is going to an executive session to evaluate the qualifications of an applicant for public employment. We will be in executive session for approximately 10 minutes and until approximately 344.\nSpeaker 0: Now I'm asking the public to leave the chambers at the time, as well as any kind of employee not directly necessary for these discussions. Thank you. That's the big theme to the dedication. Good afternoon. We're coming out of executive session.\nSpeaker 0: This is a committee of the whole continuing our Monday, July 15th meeting, and I would entertain a motion on item five on today's agenda. Councilmember Dombrowski. Thank you, Mr. Chair. On proposed motion 2019 0307.1. That's position number two.\nSpeaker 0: I move. Adoption Council member Dombrowski has moved adoption of Motion 2019 307, making the appointment to position two of the Northeast District District Court. Councilmember Dombrowski Mr.. Online 25 where the is a blank space I move that we insert the name of Michelle Gilson.\nSpeaker 0: It's been moved in seconded. We amend motion 2019 307 to have the name of Michelle Gilson speak to speak to each member. Dombrowski. Just very briefly, Michelle was the strong choice coming out of the select committee. Her background and experience impressed us and me as a representative of the Boston community.\nSpeaker 0: She comes before us with the strongest of recommendations, including many from our friends to the North, with her roots in Snohomish County, putting their prosecuting attorney. She has served the city of battle extremely well in terms of administering justice, but also in running the court from an administrative perspective.\nSpeaker 0: Her work has been recognized with the awards that she noted here. Frankly, unusual for a municipal court judge to be recognized in some ways. And that caught our attention. Our bar rate ratings are also impressive. I tend to look at those and weigh those heavily.\nSpeaker 0: I think as many members do in this process. And I just think she will serve us very well on the district court and encourage my colleagues support for her. See no further discussion. Councilmember Gossett.\nSpeaker 2: I'd like to second Councilman Dombrovskis recommendation. I first time I met her, I was so impressed with the wide variety of letters that she's gotten from legal as well as community folks and politicians. And still, at the end here, when I look at all the support letters and comments for all three candidates, the quality and the number\nSpeaker 2: are just amazing for her. So I look forward to joining Councilmember DEMBOSKY and supporting this extremely well qualified person for this position.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Lambert.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd also like to say that I support this. I believe that Michelle is very innovative. I really liked reading all the letters, and it was clear that she's done a lot in the community and dealing with restorative justice.\nSpeaker 1: And she also has starting the youth court. And during the interviews earlier we she talked about how there were many changes and adaptations and things to improve that, and I really respected that. She continued her perfected work going on and on.\nSpeaker 1: And I know in one conversation we were talking about some ways to help children, and she followed up with me afterward to say, Tell me more about children and their vision problems and how that impacts. So I was very impressed with the idea that when she heard an idea, it just clicked.\nSpeaker 1: So I support this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Bell, DG.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. There's not a really good time in the agenda to say this, so I'm just going to say it now. If we had three openings, these are all three extraordinarily well qualified candidates. So I just wanted to say that at this moment before we start picking people to be appointed and and I hope that\nSpeaker 1: it comes through to the public and to everybody who's following this process, that what we have here are three people who are really committed to strong judicial practice. They've given years of their lives to working on the bench.\nSpeaker 1: And that takes that takes a little bit of that takes some sacrifice. You can't have a completely unlimited private civil practice or even criminal practice and and pro tem the way these folks do. You have to give up some stuff to do that.\nSpeaker 1: And so and they all come with strong recommendations, a great deal of relevant experience, and importantly, a civic record of working outside the court just to make the community a better place, which I think reflects well on their on their abilities and what they will bring to the courtroom.\nSpeaker 1: So I just wanted to say that before we started picking and I agree with my colleagues and everything that's been said about Judge Gilson, you know, we ask questions. And one of the questions that I had was whether a municipal court experience translates directly to a district court experience.\nSpeaker 1: But from everything I've been able to judge, from talking to folks who have worked with Judge Gilson and others, that they believe very strongly that she would be able to make that transition very well. And I was exhausted reading her her application materials, and she's done all of that stuff.\nSpeaker 1: So I think she's going to work very, very hard to make sure that she she is a strong district court judge. And I look forward to voting yes on the motion.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for the discussion. Others in favor of Councilmember Dombrowski is amendment. Please say I opposed nay. The ayes have it. The motion as amended for the discussion. Councilmember Dombrowski, just to close the story from Judge Wilson's application materials, she's a hands on practitioner of restorative justice practices, and she described the youth court that she founded in\nSpeaker 0: the city of Bothell and observing a difference in the outcomes based on whether it was a young man or a young woman in a justice circle, a peace circle, if you will, where the conduct, as she described it, of the young woman warranted perhaps a more lenient sentence.\nSpeaker 0: It was reflective of the young woman's understanding of the infraction and her ability and willingness to do better versus the young man who was a little less sympathetic. But it turns out the result was different. So she took that experience to heart, reflected on whether or not they were really practicing the principles of restorative justice and changed\nSpeaker 0: the system. I thought that encapsulated all that we want in our judicial system today awareness, a willingness to implement new practices and a willingness to continue to revise and improve them. Her initiative and not just saying she's doing it, but actually doing it and doing it well, really struck home with me and confirmed everything that we've heard\nSpeaker 0: about her. I'm excited to see her join the district court. Congratulations. Thank you. Madam Croak, will you please call the roll?\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Balducci. Councilmember Dombrowski. Councilmember done. Councilmember Gossett, I. Councilmember Caldwell's. Councilmember Lambert. Councilmember of the Grove. Councilmember Bond right there. Mr. Chair. Hi, Mr. Chair. The vote is 99 zero no's.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We have given a do pass recommendation to motion 1219 307 as amended. We'll send that to full council and regular course on on consent without objection. That takes us to item six in today's agenda. Congratulations that exist item six on today's agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Motion 2019 308 Councilmember Lambert.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to move. Propose motion 2019 0308.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Lambert has moved adoption of Motion 2019 308.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Lambert I'd like to move an amendment for Lane 25 and insert the name juggling.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Lambert has moved that we amend motion 2019 308. Councilmember Lambert.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Well, I'm I agree with what Councilmember Balducci said. We have a strong group of candidates that we were able to interview among the strongest group of candidates that we've ever had. And so the decisions are difficult.\nSpeaker 1: But I feel that Jewell's solid experience, she's effective and efficient on the bench. She has a very caring manner and looking to people and how to make people's lives better. And she also has experience that's going to be particularly powerful right now as we transition to the new computer system.\nSpeaker 1: And so I thought that that would be helpful. She's also known and highly respected in the community, and I think that that's important, that the judges be respected in the community. And I think her transition for many reasons will be very smooth.\nSpeaker 1: And I look forward to her being on the bench on the east side.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for the discussion.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember Gossett I just wanted to have the opportunity to concur with my colleagues that all three of these candidates were and are extremely well qualified. I do. But before we close, I did want to say about Kevin Peck that his excellent interviews that he had with the Latino and African-American bar associations, I was thought that I pay\nSpeaker 2: particular attention to, and that is the articulation of issues relative to social justice. And this community in this society are ones that, you know, if he doesn't get elected, I hope that he will continue to stay involved in looking for a judicial position or a leadership position in the judicial system, where he can even more effectively carry\nSpeaker 2: on the kind of understanding, experience and skills that that he has. But I agree with everybody. All three of these candidates are superbly well qualified.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Caldwell's.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. What Councilmember Bell did, she said, was really very poignant and very significant. And a number of us have known Kevin Peck for a long time and have the greatest respect for him. And when she said and a couple of others implied that, that we really do hope that the third person in this case\nSpeaker 1: , Kevin, will apply for the next opening. And I think there would be a lot of support. You never know. But I certainly would encourage that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. See no further discussion of those in favor of the amendment. Please signify by saying i. I those opposed nay. The ayes have it. The motion as amended. Councilmember Lambert.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I just want to say a final passage to say that we have great candidates. And I think that Joe will do an awesome job representing the east side of the county. I know that they rotate around the county, but I think her demeanor and her caring attitude will be useful and helpful to people changing their\nSpeaker 1: lives.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. But Councilmember Belushi.\nSpeaker 1: I know I should stop at this point, but I'm very I'm very excited to support Judge Kling becoming that full time seat at the table, person getting involved in helping to make change in our courts. But I really, really do hope that we get an opportunity to elevate Judge Peck as well, because I was very impressed with\nSpeaker 1: your deep, lifelong commitment to equity and justice that comes out in everything that you do and everything that you say. And and frankly, these proposals, people should steal them and do them anyway. And then you should get the credit.\nSpeaker 1: And I hope that you don't give up. I hope that we see you here again. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Dunn. Thank you. Forgive me. A little cold here. Just wanted to say thanks for your your interest in this. And you guys all ran the gantlet. It's really challenging to get this appointment. It's the first time I've seen three really, really outstanding candidates come before us where there was very little to create gaps in terms of\nSpeaker 0: how to rank order the cabinet. You and I had a chance to litigate against each other back in the day when I was a federal prosecutor. And you had a fantastic job for your clients. And I will tell you this.\nSpeaker 0: This is an interesting job because we get to see people again and again come up at appointments that occur for positions that we might have another one at six months or three months or eight months. And so I've seen many times where so it did get get the gig that they came forward a few months later and\nSpeaker 0: got it. And it has a part to do with your continued commitment, but also we're familiar with you. We like you. There's a lot of good stuff that was said here about you today. So I'm just really excited that all three of you are here in our county, work at various capacities.\nSpeaker 0: Look forward to supporting the nominees today, and we'll take great interest if you decide to play again. Thank you. Would you please call the roll?\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Council Bell. Duty Council member Dombrowski. Council member. Done. All right. Council Member Gazette. Council Member. Coles. Council member. Member. Council. Member of the group. Council Member one right there. Mr. Chair. All right. Mr. Chair, the vote is 990.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. By your vote, we've given a do pass recommendation to motion 2019 308 as amended, and we will send that to full council in regular course meeting a week from Wednesday on consent. Without objection and without congratulations.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. In knowing of no other business to come before the committee. We are.\n",

Councilmember Pearce. Vice Mayor Andrews. Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request city attorney to work with City Manager and Long Beach Office of Equity to draft a resolution that articulates the city's commitment to adopting the framework for reconciliation and Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. With that, let me turn this over to Councilmember Rex Richardson.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to start by just acknowledging this moment and the urgency of this moment. We are facing a crisis. We're facing an emergency. Over the past two weeks, aspects of structural racism have caught the attention of our entire community.\nSpeaker 5: It demands change. It demands leadership from our local community. It's a moment that we can't ignore. Much like the rest of the nation, Long Beach is facing a crisis on three sides with the COVID 19 pandemic that disproportionately impacts African-Americans and seniors economic impacts of the pandemic.\nSpeaker 5: That really draws into the question into question the fiscal structure and status of all local governments. And then finally, the impacts of systemic racism and the evidence of police brutality across our all across our country. Racial equity needs to be a top priority, fully embraced by the city.\nSpeaker 5: As we respond to this pandemic, as respond to civil unrest, the racial inequity in our health and our economy. It's a public health emergency. It's exacerbated by COVID 19 and requiring an immediate response by the highest levels of our city.\nSpeaker 5: Now we all witnessed the brutal killing of Mr. George Floyd by four Minneapolis police officers. And all across America, people are protesting an unjust system where evidence demonstrates demonstrates that the system is tilted against black lives, white bodies, and the opportunity for black communities to succeed.\nSpeaker 5: This is not political opinion. This is backed backed by science and data and our own eyes which confirm it. There is no way to deny institutional racism. We are having this discussion. Because impacted people have stood up. That's what has brought this conversation to the forefront.\nSpeaker 5: This incident in Minneapolis, it's eroded public trust in every institution of government in America. We've all condemned it. We've all acknowledged it. But we need to acknowledge that public trust has been eroded in our own institution and every institution in America.\nSpeaker 5: This moment calls the question on every American city, including Long Beach. To restore that trust. That means every city. Let's take a look under our own hood to ensure that the instruments and the laws are in place to identify and eliminate institutional racism.\nSpeaker 5: A complete culture change that embraces this as a professional standard, a public health emergency, and ensures that this is essential to our vision of moving forward as a city. And here in Long Beach, we need to meet this moment head on.\nSpeaker 5: We need to restore the public's trust, restore the confidence of our community. It means we need to review our own practices across the city. It means that we do not gloss over this moment and that we publicly acknowledge that the efforts are moving forward, are centered on the experiences of impacted black people in our community and our\nSpeaker 5: city cannot move forward until we examine our history with race and listen to the voices of the public. Institutions are driven by laws and systems. Those systems are laced with race, gender and the values of those who are in power, who write laws.\nSpeaker 5: It means that we take this time to reevaluate our own mission and our own values and our organizational philosophy, to prioritize racial and economic equity and science and data. The five most common social determinants of health are economic stability, education, social and community context, health and health care and the built environment.\nSpeaker 5: Studies show that the environments we're born into. But where we learn where we work, where we play and where we live impacts the health and quality of life outcomes. This is very much apparent in America. It is very much apparent in Long Beach, where there is a seven year difference in life expectancy for residents living in East\nSpeaker 5: Long Beach neighborhoods compared to those in north west and southwest parts of our city. There is a deep segregation in divide and to narratives within our city. And life expectancy is also disparate across race and ethnic lines in our city.\nSpeaker 5: As black black residents are among the lowest rate at 79 years. In comparison in comparison to the citywide average of 83 years. The same socio economic factors are evident in the disproportionate impact of COVID 19 on African-American communities across our country.\nSpeaker 5: Cities like Chicago, Washington, DC, Madison, Los Angeles and Long Beach. They show that African-Americans overrepresented in COVID 19 infections and deaths compared to the share of the total population. Long Beach has the same overrepresentation as African-Americans here in our city make up 12% of the city's population and 22% of the city's COVID 19 deaths.\nSpeaker 5: We need to commit our system to ending the narrative of the tale of two cities in this moment. We need to acknowledge our own history of racial inequity, not shy away from our history of police brutality and reform and modernize our laws, our policing practices, our policies across the city to align and restore public trust and basic\nSpeaker 5: standards of dignity for every resident. Now, when I say institutional racism. I believe that we are one agency. We should have one vision. This is not about calling out any individual. This is about calling out our own institution.\nSpeaker 5: So this race crisis that deserves as much attention and resources as the COVID 19 response, we need. We need a high level analysis and decision making. We need a clear reporting structure. We need transparency. We need accountability to the community.\nSpeaker 5: And we need a framework that will put the City Council in the position to take action on comprehensive reform, to ensure our own laws and our practices reflect our values of our current city, acknowledges institutional racism, acknowledges our own laws and practices that perpetuate the tale of two cities, two very different Long Beach experiences.\nSpeaker 5: It means that we commit publicly to our people to comprehensive reform. That means systems change, placing values of racial equity and public trust into all of our systems, including our charter, including our municipal code, including our city manager departments, including the police department, and including our city budget to make sure it aligns with the standards of the\nSpeaker 5: modern American city. Now, tonight, the framework presented is a four step process that requires the city to critically review departmental policies and practices, engage affected communities, and prepare an action plan that will institutionalize racial equity in language. The framework should be data driven so that we can pinpoint disparity and prepare solutions.\nSpeaker 5: What are we reconciled folks to say? Why do we call it reconciliation? We can call it what we want to call it, but what we are reconciling is the gap between the experiences of public people, the impacted people, our current policies, and how they stand up against national standards and best practices.\nSpeaker 5: We are one agency. We should have one vision to be the best city in America for everyone, not just centered on not just some. And it should be centered on the experiences of our most vulnerable in our community.\nSpeaker 5: So the first step outlined is to acknowledge our city. Our own history with racism and commit to a process of doing that. Furthermore, we should acknowledge our own histories of police violence, of systemic inequities, lack of investment into certain communities north central west Long Beach, and commit to reforming those things.\nSpeaker 5: Next. We need to listen. What that means is we need to hear the voices that have been protests in our community in a formal way and put it on the record. We need to hear from the experience of affected communities.\nSpeaker 5: We need to listen to the stories of impacted residents. These will be difficult stories to listen to, but it's important that our organization listens to the stories of impacted residents. We need to listen to our own employees as well, across every department, including the police department.\nSpeaker 5: We need to convene and follow the listening. Following the listening, we need to meet and convene with stakeholders, starting with the black community and impacted people. Our community is not monolithic. Do not cluster all the black community together, but rather give impacted families the space to engage in this process in a meaningful way.\nSpeaker 5: If the faith community, the space to engage this discussion in a meaningful way, give the youth an opportunity to in the space to engage in this discussion in meaningful way, need to also engage an independent third party organization to help us facilitate the process of convening, to add and ensure public trust, as well as the process of\nSpeaker 5: reviewing our citywide policies and presenting those recommendations. For example, today we received a letter of support from Policy Link, a National Research and Action Institute that advances racial and economic equity, offering their expertize in structuring this process. They help the city with our local My Brother's Keeper process, which resulted in a nationally standard national, nationally recognized local\nSpeaker 5: action plan. We have a great relationship with educational institutions. More specifically, we have a strong relationship with Cal State Dominguez Hills, the only CSU founded in direct response to civil unrest in the 1960s. It serves the populations of north and central Long Beach.\nSpeaker 5: It's within their mission to address civil rights and racial equity. We should engage them in this process. Finally, the culmination of listening and convening will result in an action plan of immediate, short and long term recommendations for the City Council to enact, such as put us in a position to take action and in that comprehensive reform.\nSpeaker 5: This means systems change, placing our values and public trust into all of our systems charter, municipal code, city management departments and our city budget to ensure it aligns with the standards of a modern, equitable American city. Next, we need to recognize the urgency of the moment and take into consideration the timing of our current budget process and\nSpeaker 5: the timing to meet the deadline to place a measure on this November's ballot. Now. Now we're not starting from scratch. Let's just start with that. In recent years, and I've particularly paid attention to since I was elected in 2014, we know that there's been a national movement, there's since the death of the death of Trayvon Martin.\nSpeaker 5: There's been a national movement that has really thrust cities, including Long Beach, to really talk about racial equity and police reform. And we've taken a number of steps. The equity toolkit, a number of body cameras and other policies are safe.\nSpeaker 5: Long Beach Violence Prevention Plan, My Brother's Keeper, our economic inclusion plan. All of that has come from that moment. We have to acknowledge at that moment it took a tragedy of it took a tragedy of the death of Trayvon Martin and then President Obama announcing My Brother's Keeper.\nSpeaker 5: And also a pivotal point that we should acknowledge is that is the same moment that the Movement for Black Lives was established. And since then, every indication our city is that we're heading in the right direction. Are police statistics the things that we've doing is heading the right direction.\nSpeaker 5: This moment calls for us to accelerate and reform and commit to meaningful policy change, meaningful systems change consistent with this moment, consistent with our values for the future. So tonight, I'm asking my colleagues to support this framework. I'm asking them to commit to the framework, but throw into the kitchen sink the types of things you're you've heard\nSpeaker 5: , the types of things you want to see reviewed. We want to make sure we have high level staff ready to receive these things and make sure they're considered into this process. If you have thoughts on what needs to be reformed in our city, throw it into the kitchen sink, throw it all into this kitchen sink.\nSpeaker 5: And and immediately following this, we want to be clear, and I encourage my colleagues to echo if echo and let the city manager know that this is a top priority for the city council and that is urgent and should be treated as an emergency.\nSpeaker 5: That said, those conclude my comments. I would like to hear from my colleagues on what reforms they like to see within this come out of this framework or what types of things we want to evaluate, what are the things that we want to commit to explore and what types of reforms that our intentions are clear at the\nSpeaker 5: very beginning. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Next up is council member Austin.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And first of all, I want to acknowledge Councilmember Rich and his team for putting together a very, very comprehensive item. That I think of the covers most of it. I mean, that's a very good job of doing that.\nSpeaker 4: And so so I salute him in his esteem for doing that. I was happy to sign on to go on sponsor of this item. Obviously also want to acknowledge my colleagues, the rest of the city staff for their acknowledgment and understanding of this very pivotal time that we are in.\nSpeaker 4: I want to thank you all for your collective commitment to change on Long Beach, but also being a catalyst for change for our entire country. We can show people how it's done. We are a special city. And this also I want to acknowledge those who are taking action today and have been taking action over the last ten\nSpeaker 4: or 12 days or so of protesting for change. Outraged by what they have seen. Today we are grieved as a nation of the horrific death of George Floyd. May he rest in peace. Today we began a difficult and we begin a difficult process of preparing for reconciliation, which will frame the pathway to justice, the systemic change.\nSpeaker 4: Today, Long Beach has a responsibility to George Floyd, his family, really every black person in this city in America to acknowledge that his life mattered, that all black lives matter. This tragic event has awakened the world to this country's ugly truth.\nSpeaker 4: Nation. With white supremacy at its foundation, a nation that is not equal to everyone. A nation with great wealth. Where oppressive black people and poor people are. Nor a nation that is and is fatally flawed. And has fatally flawed systems.\nSpeaker 4: Economic systems, health care systems, education systems and policing and in 2020 still do not afford liberty and justice for all. Today in our city, we have a duty to advance equity and opportunity and to create a place where every resident has opportunities and feels respected regardless of their race or socioeconomic status.\nSpeaker 4: As a city council, we have a duty to be smarter and more intentional with our decisions. The resource allocation. My responsibility today is to help lead this city through this moment. Then my life experiences perspective, I believe, has prepared me for very well.\nSpeaker 4: And I feel like our work presence on this council at this time more purposeful than ever with the work before us. And so I don't take this duty casually in any way because I recognize that this is. Arguably the most impactful work they will do.\nSpeaker 4: Together as elected leaders in this city. We've made progress certainly in this city. We have lot to be proud of. But in light of what we are experiencing today, it's put a light sunshine and we still have much work to do to improve conditions for a large percentage of our city.\nSpeaker 4: And to the community. I would like to say I'm accepting this charge. I'm prepared to listen and listen more than I speak. I want to learn. I want to act accordingly. My actions on this council do advocacy with our state and federal partners officials, because that is where a lot of change will come as well.\nSpeaker 4: We won't be able to breathe it as a city until we deliver and deliver on the promise of liberty and justice for all. So we deliver on the promise of racial equity. And we work to truly. Change the systems that have oppressed so many for so long.\nSpeaker 4: And, you know, like I said, this is a a major moment in our city's history. No more wrecks you challenged us to will throw everything at the kitchen sink. And I have an item coming up which I think will be a great first step because we have a civilian oversight process.\nSpeaker 4: That I'm not sure that everybody is aware of. I'm not sure that everybody has full confidence in. But that is one area that I want to see us immediately tackle from an administrative standpoint. And then talk about opportunities to to change potentially change the charter in doing so.\nSpeaker 4: And so I'm going to reserve my comments for now because I want to hear from my colleagues as well. But I'm fully in support of this item, happy to second it and look forward to the discussion and the progress that we will make together collectively as a city, as a city team, but as a community to really\nSpeaker 4: address the ills of the past. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council Member Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Thank you, Mayor. You know, if you were at the city hall today at 9 a.m.. I just want to see Tom. And they said came. It was the beginning of some transformation. Having lived through three rides in the city, the inequities have occurred across the country.\nSpeaker 4: I find it very hard to form words. So I'm just going to talk about the issues that bothers me and the things that I fought for in my community every day. I don't really talk on this subject that much.\nSpeaker 4: I believe that being on the stage is about opening the doors to the community and the respect we have, the privilege and the honor to be voted in. And I want to share the battle and the challenge. I see because this is a listening tour reunion, the stakeholders coming forward.\nSpeaker 4: There are things I would like to see Long Beach do better, and I am committed to doing my part to see the change. I mean, no disrespect to any of my colleagues. If some of these issues seem foreign to you, the kind of issues that affect the success and the community of color and you may have to\nSpeaker 4: do not have to deal with them. But I brought up. Against these issues every day. And I drive in my community and sometimes I feel I'm the only one. How is it that the minorities make up the large part?\nSpeaker 4: The Refuge Team. I'll get. Okay. And it is a career that gets many people with their record in the door to be part of a city team. How can we do more to bring local and diverse hiring practices for permanent positions with the benefit to the community of corporate?\nSpeaker 4: How is it that someone can live in our community but still don't have experience working in certain parts and dealing with that of the community? Yet they continue to accept a supervisor position because they do not have a college degree.\nSpeaker 4: How is it that our Workforce Development Department and Youth Workforce Office is one of the most provincial areas of the city? And we started by saying we can't issue people that live in the inner city bus passes to get there.\nSpeaker 4: How is it that we have a nonprofit that simply asked to help relocate and do work in partnership with workforce partners? And we cannot come up with additional aid. How is it that we. Yes. Now I'm trying to strive for the African American culture in.\nSpeaker 4: How did the city police complaint in Michigan? Does that have an opportunity to have someone who's actually been arrested to serve on it? How? That we can take away community watch programs like Grit. How is it that we do not have a gang unit yet?\nSpeaker 4: We continue to see our black and Latinos get. While under arrest in Japan, getting watches on this list. How is the world going to work with our city prosecutor in city attorney office and talk about expanding the level of the playing field and make it a level playing field?\nSpeaker 4: How would you say we are going to, you know, incorporate all the commissions like the Civil Service Commission to be involved, the change that we're going to do? Are we going to work with the school district to start these conversations about community and policies?\nSpeaker 4: Are we going to diversify our budget so that the rate does not have to do the work? They don't have the current staffing for. I did set up standup outreaches in the Mecca and even go to knock on someone's door because their neighbors has a problem.\nSpeaker 4: There was a time when it came out the police would play basketball with former gang members. And because we wanted to we wanted to brag about this because those conversations and get away from this people that you are we grew up that we did not we do not fight this we we did not.\nSpeaker 4: But just to go ahead. Why are we having these kind of policemen if we need that in our justice? The policy caused this policy cause we look at My Brother's Keeper and what about my sister's keeper? Let's talk about women and about elevating something like that.\nSpeaker 4: I know I've talked a little more than usual, but this is a great item. I want to highlight that even though Rhett and I do not always see eye to eye, our hearts are way in the right place.\nSpeaker 4: Just do up by community and not forget where we came from. We are from three different areas, but we are brothers and it is an honor to serve with them on this diocese. And I want to thank everyone for giving me a chance to speak on this island.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. I wanted to make sure. Of course. I don't think it's lost on anyone. Of course that we have three three amazing council members, of course, three members from the black community that have long histories in the city and and a history of leadership.\nSpeaker 3: So I want to thank the three of you, Councilman Richardson, Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Austin, for all, of course, coauthoring the item and for the leadership that you guys are all displaying in this crisis and in the past as well.\nSpeaker 3: I know we have everyone queued up to speak. Most folks get up to speak. And so I want to before I get to that, I'm going to make some some general comments and then I know we're going to get into more of a discussion.\nSpeaker 3: Just let me just begin by saying that they said also last week, I join the the peaceful protesters in expressing my grief, my outrage over the death of George Floyd. This has been a very, very difficult time for not just Long Beach, for our country and for our community.\nSpeaker 3: What we're seeing in America's streets is a call for action and demands for justice and racial equity. And there's no question we still have a long way to go to achieve Dr. King's dream of equality for all of racial justice for black Americans.\nSpeaker 3: And so it's up to us, I think, first and foremost, to acknowledge that we have a problem. And that's how you begin a fixing are the systemic issues that we have in our institutions by acknowledging that we have a problem.\nSpeaker 3: We know that for far too long. And then really every aspect of American life, black Americans have not experienced equal treatment. I mean, this is the case not just in government institutions, which we run, obviously the city, but it's true in our education system, too, and workforce.\nSpeaker 3: It's true in in the nonprofit world, black Americans have not experienced equal treatment. This is not that Long Beach is not accepted. Accepted by that. We Long Beach is no exception to that and there are no exceptions to that.\nSpeaker 3: We know that the peaceful demonstrations that we've seen are an important part of our local history and the civil rights movement across the country as well. And we also know what is what we're hearing out in the community.\nSpeaker 3: It is demands and action is being asked of us as a city. I want to commend this. This concept of a framework for the city. This framework for reconciliation. I think the most important part of this is that it's been obviously put there's a lot of thought that has gone into this framework.\nSpeaker 3: I know that the key piece of this, of course, is acknowledging the existence of systemic racism in this country, that we all know that to be true. And the listening piece and I think that is something that I think is really important for us.\nSpeaker 3: One thing that I've heard from our black friends, from black organizers and community members is before we get too far ahead of what we think should happen, it's important for us to listen to the community as to what actions need to happen.\nSpeaker 3: And so I respect and honor that. And we started that work. And just I just yesterday I was with a variety of young people and youth that were sharing their stories with me. And I want to thank them.\nSpeaker 3: And, and those young, young people from the YMCA and the youth that really shared their stories of growing up in Long Beach and their challenges and fears. And I want to uplift that and continue to do that. Listening.\nSpeaker 3: And I think what's great about the opportunity to listen is it gives then us an opportunity to really ensure that the entire city is part of that process, including our management team and our staff. And I want to thank I know, Councilman Richardson, you uplifted that and mentioned that, and I support that.\nSpeaker 3: In this process. And in the listening piece, of course, you listen to bring people together and then to to have action. And there needs to, of course, be assurances from the community that we are going to have an action plan out of this.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that's part of this process. I also want to go back to something that Councilmember Richardson was alluding to, which I think and I think he's right. I think, you know, we we we know that the Long Beach Police Department has come a long way in in reforms.\nSpeaker 3: You think about just the last five years there we have every officer that's trained in de-escalation. We know that mental health and racial equity are now trained within the department, and there's a lot more accountability measures in place.\nSpeaker 3: This council has been a leader on body worn cameras, and so has our rank and file officers who've been involved in that process. And if you look at issues just around use of force, for example, use of force incidents just last year, I believe, were the lowest they've probably been in many years, and including the use of\nSpeaker 3: force, which has declined, but also the officer involved shootings have dramatically declined. And so that tells me that at the rank and that there is progress. And like any organization, when you have progress, you still have more and more to do.\nSpeaker 3: All of us, all our institutions have a long way to go to get better and to meet the needs of our community. I want to I wanted to say that and it's important and it's important to note this as this discussion has been going on, that all aspects of American life and our institutions need to be reviewed\nSpeaker 3: . It's something that all of us as a city need to listen to and uplift. We know that we are committed as a community to reforms. We want to strengthen them. And I look forward to the conversations in the weeks ahead with the community, with black organizers, with students to address this crisis facing our nation.\nSpeaker 3: We will listen. We will dialog, and then we will act. And so I know our community and our country are counting on us. And I look forward to discussion ahead this evening. And so thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for and I'm taking a leadership role in the framework.\nSpeaker 3: And to the other members that have put this this agenda item together with the community. So thank you for that. And with that, I want to turn this over to the other members of the council. Next up is council.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman Pryce. Actually, I think you remember that. Senator Pearce, I know you were an agenda agenda item this week next or did you want to wait?\nSpeaker 2: I'd love to be able, sir. I see you. Go ahead also.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Are you sure? I don't mind. I can wait.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Let me go. I thought I was next so I would go.\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead, please. I'll go after you. No problem.\nSpeaker 2: Think about the system as that. You never know where you are in the queue. So you only lie on point like. Can I go to the bathroom? No, not yet. Okay. Thank you, guys. Really, I want to ground us in the words that were said before you and I, Mayor and I really appreciate the leadership and the\nSpeaker 2: big picture vision that Councilmember Richardson has put in front of us. And that really is process. And anybody that knows me, I always talk about process and how important it is to listen. And so to hear each of the areas of deep concern for our African-American council members, it's really important that we root this conversation and that\nSpeaker 2: . And so I want to thank you for that. Of this item. You know, I know it kind of moved fast and so many pieces of it are critical. The acknowledging, which was powerful to hear council council member, powerful to see the work that Tom Modica has done to really make sure that our city employees, possibly for the\nSpeaker 2: first time ever, have been told race matters, you matter. And I'm here to listen to you this morning was very powerful to see all of the words and the thoughts, to hear from our own city employees that have said, my brother was arrested.\nSpeaker 2: My cousin was this I experienced this oppression. And it really is when we talk about the whole city. It is systematic oppression. When we think back to how this country was started, it was formed. In a way that was built on oppression.\nSpeaker 2: Our railroads are built on oppression. A lot of our buildings are built with that. Our roads, our cities, the foundation of them were built on believing that somebody else was less than us. And I, when we ground ourselves in that, I think it gets really emotional because I don't think that anybody on this council or in the\nSpeaker 2: city government believes in that model. We all want to believe that we're not racist. We all want to believe that the system is fair because we've had the 13th Amendment, because we've gotten out of what we would call Jim Crow era.\nSpeaker 2: But we haven't. And the way that we know that we haven't is in our very own numbers. L.A. County alone. Councilmember Richardson spoke to COVID. So the numbers of COVID in L.A. County alone yesterday were blacks are dying 2 to 1 to whites.\nSpeaker 2: 2 to 1. Two to me. In our county. We know that these numbers are real. We know that black women are spending 63% of their income on rent. Can each of you out there listening think about spending 63% of your income on rent and maybe you're a single mom, maybe you have a kid, maybe you have two\nSpeaker 2: . What that means for us and why we've been fighting in this city for so long on some of these issues, we know that in the city of Long Beach, we have a life expectancy difference of 17 years. That's from our own city report.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmembers Richardson, Austin and Dee mentioned, we know we've got the tools in Long Beach to address these issues, whether it's everyone in, whether it's the Office of Equity, whether it's issues around our housing. My Brother's Keeper. My Sister's Keeper.\nSpeaker 2: But it's been it's helped. And I don't want to diminish the work that it's done. But until our entire city says racism exists within our bones, we will not change it. So we realized that in 2014, blacks were arrested four times more than whites.\nSpeaker 2: In 2015, we were the most violent. In 2016. One which had a killing rate of 10.6 persons per year. And I agree, Mayor, that this city, from the time that I got on the council to today, I feel like our numbers are probably really great.\nSpeaker 2: But telling my community members and my neighbors that our block or my neighbors that have had their kids go through some part of the system, hey, guess what? We're better today without any facts in front of me. It's really hard.\nSpeaker 2: And so as we talk about listening, it's taking those stories of our black community with us into every meeting that we take. Even if we think nothing about race in that meeting and I'll lift up health and our climate.\nSpeaker 2: We got a lengthy letter today that was authored by SONA. One of our environmental committee members are Sustainable Commission. And she lifts up these numbers about health, the fact that African-Americans don't have the same level of access to health care, that the number one cause of death for many of them are diseases that are caused by poor\nSpeaker 2: environmental quality. Like heart disease, like asthma. These are the numbers that tell our story, Long Beach. Our story is not, hey, we're doing better in this one department. Our story has to be that we're doing better for everyone because we know whenever the person that is the most oppressed in the city is doing well, that we're all\nSpeaker 2: doing well. We should all all of us in the city of Long Beach be thriving to make sure that the person that is the most oppressed that is on the streets of this city have every access to better health care, housing, education, because we know for them this moment is the moment that's going to matter most for\nSpeaker 2: them. So when we talk about what to throw in the kitchen sink? Councilmember Richardson The first thing that we have to do is we have to get data and it has to be transparent. I have said many emails to many people inside City Hall asking for numbers, and I've been told that we were going to get numbers\nSpeaker 2: and that we would have a report. Over the last ten years. For. I think in my heart that we have done better in Long Beach PD. But I'm a data person and I don't see those numbers. And so the first, I want to make sure that we are building transparency and trust with our police department.\nSpeaker 2: And that's going to take them sharing everything that they can. The numbers of use of force, the demographics of who has been involved in those, both on the officer side and on the public side. We want to know the best practices in the country.\nSpeaker 2: What are the best practices in the city that in cities that have made sure that these numbers have gone down so that our police officers can walk down the street proud? Because I'm sure right now this is probably a really tough time for all of them, but it's been a really tough time for our black community for\nSpeaker 2: 400 years. And so we're going to have to go through an uncomfortable process, and it has to be genuine. I want us to make sure that we're talking about, as mentioned by also by Councilmember Richardson. The four areas of our city where we can really make structural change.\nSpeaker 2: Our budget. There's a lot of words being thrown out there. The first thing I want to say is we need to know what's in our budget. I have personally, I don't have the details of what's in our police budget.\nSpeaker 2: And so I don't know what even to say about that. Right. And I know that we've got youth that we've fought to get $200,000 for youth funding for them, which we got, which was great. We've got a youth strategic plan that needs to make sure it has a race lens on it.\nSpeaker 2: Right. And that we're talking about how do we how do we make sure that crime doesn't happen in the first place to make an excuse to be able to have more officers than we might need? How do we make sure we're investing on the front end in our health department, in our kids and our job program, and\nSpeaker 2: that we're really thinking outside the box. To do that, we need data. And I've said that since I've been on this council. And so I'm very excited about this opportunity to hopefully be really transparent with our city budget.\nSpeaker 2: I know this budget year is tough and it's going to be fast. I'm looking forward to our charter conversations, but I understand that charter changes are going to have to wait because we don't have an election coming up that we can put charter changes on.\nSpeaker 2: So then I'm really going to ask staff to put everything and every thought into it. Whenever we talk about the muni code, what are we doing on the muni code that we can really make sure we have some community oversight because every city is funded by the taxpayers and the taxpayers are undocumented residents.\nSpeaker 2: There are people that come through our city and our tourists, their residents. And I've lived here forever and they're tenants that have lived here. And so what are we making sure that in our muni code that we are creating, if possible, a civilian oversight committee that is free from the city structure that we have.\nSpeaker 2: I want to see what that looks like. I want to see the best practices in the whole country for how we can make sure we do that and have real, clear transparency. Because when we have situations like today, people are speaking up that we never thought would speak up.\nSpeaker 2: We have commissioners and almost every single commission that the city has, it has said something about how they want the city to be moving forward and we have to listen to them. And Tom, I know that sometimes I get a little mushy with you because hiring you was a big deal to me.\nSpeaker 2: It was my what I thought was going to be the last big step that I took as a council member. And one of the biggest things that was an issue for me as a white woman was you being white and being in the city for so long.\nSpeaker 2: But I am so proud of the courage and the dedication that you have made to everybody in the city. And when I say that comment, I hope it doesn't trigger anybody, but it's just diversifying. Our leadership is important so that we can have black stories leading the conversation.\nSpeaker 2: But we also have to recognize that you are extremely skilled. You're extremely thoughtful. I think you've been great for the city, and I think you're going to be wonderful leading us through this process. So I'm so proud. So those four areas being able to look at them and really talk about them is the most important.\nSpeaker 2: We have transparency that we're talking about budget items that we're talking about our use, that we're making sure that our conversation goes outside the city walls and we're talking with educational institutions and business improvement districts. I know one of my birds is so excited about going through this reconciliation process with their own community members.\nSpeaker 2: We have to do this not just for George Floyd, but we have to do it for Tyler Woods, for Hector. Or Dante. I'm sorry for Hector. Moran for Dante. Jordan or for Ross. Moran for Noel Aguilera. For Aerial Smith, Vermonters.\nSpeaker 2: For Martin. Corrado for Berry. Brock for Jason. I know Gibson for Kerry. Michael found some for Louis Ramirez. For Jordan. Michael Griffin for Katherine Gomez. And for Marcella Byrd. For Frederick Tapp, who was killed by a white supremacist.\nSpeaker 2: We owe it to these people to make sure that we root out systematic racism and acknowledge our own racism within ourselves. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, often, Andy, for bringing this item forward.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. I know I've got obviously everyone queued up, so when I get to those, I want to just to clarify something also, I think that I think Councilmember Pearce, you you and I both asked this question on data.\nSpeaker 3: And I think just so that you get one of those answers now, I think that the police department is working on. My understanding is, remember, they've done back now, I think about five years. They're trying to go back ten years.\nSpeaker 3: So, Mr. Modica, I think that's something from I heard earlier today that the request that's being made by the Council is coming to the council pretty soon. Is that right? Yes, Mr..\nSpeaker 6: Mayor. So we see this and we we hear loud and clear that data is important. We couldn't agree more. There is a lot that we have to share, and that data does take some time to get together. We have started already.\nSpeaker 6: We can provide some of the use of force statistics and officer involved shooting statistics. But we do understand and you know, there are some requests from the council, but we're really going to be launching into kind of a review of the data.\nSpeaker 6: We're going to be asking our innovation team to help us with that and to actually help display it and make it understandable and transparent and have have that available for this part of the discussion. So we we are going to be making a commitment on that and and providing a lot of those data.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Modica. Thank you. And I hope that also answers whatever comes your questions. Let me go to the queue and I know some people are queue to back up, so we'll get to everybody first and then we'll go back around.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I want to thank my colleagues who have brought this item forward, especially my African-American colleagues, because no matter how many experiences we share in common, there are many experiences that we don't share in common because of our backgrounds.\nSpeaker 1: They may not ever know the experience of a child who came to America during a revolution in her own country and learned to speak the language with her mother as they made their way in the new world. And I may not ever know the conversations that each of them had at their dinner table with their families and\nSpeaker 1: their children that I may not ever have to have with my own children. And I want to thank our city manager, because he did. Right. Send an email that was just so profound and had a few points in it that really I've thought a lot about over the last few days.\nSpeaker 1: And that was one of those points. I'm grateful for this opportunity to listen and to learn. And I like what Vice Mayor Andrews shared earlier in his comments, which was acknowledging that we may not always agree or see eye to eye on every issue.\nSpeaker 1: But I think having worked with this group of people for six years that I can say whole heartedly with every fiber in my body that every member of this council is a good person and cares about this city.\nSpeaker 1: Even if we don't agree on every issue. But this is an opportunity where I think we are all aligned and we all will be focused as we move forward as a city. The events we have seen locally and throughout the nation require that we be on the right side of history and take this moment seriously and focus\nSpeaker 1: on the important issues of justice, accountability and fairness. These are issues that should be at the heart of everything that we do. That should always be the case. And it's very tragic that it took the life of George George Floyd to remind us of that important value.\nSpeaker 1: We must make significant progress to ensure that our city is at the forefront of responsible and accountable policing, as well as on the focus of residents in the city of Long Beach. Every single one of them knowing that they are protected by our police and can trust in the integrity of our system.\nSpeaker 1: Nationally, we have seen the devastating misuse of power by a minneapolis police officer against George Floyd. The impacts of that officer's actions were, of course, devastating and unconscionable for the Floyd family. But the impact has been so much broader.\nSpeaker 1: And I can tell you that as a prosecutor of 20 years, that is not the type of justice I signed up for. Like most people in this country, I, too, have been able to reflect on the tragic and violent events that we have all seen, highlighting the need for more action.\nSpeaker 1: And as Councilman Richardson said, an opportunity to listen and meaningfully dialog. One of the things I really enjoyed from reading our city manager's email is an ask that he made of the city employees that we have honest dialog without fear of saying the wrong thing or without fear of being judged.\nSpeaker 1: I know that his council members. There are times when we have very passionate people inside the council chambers advocating for something that's very important to them and a simple disagreement, even though it might be stated in the most respectable way, respectful way can be misinterpreted as not caring about an issue of the fundamental heart of a discussion\nSpeaker 1: that we're having. And I'm hoping that this opportunity is one where we allow one another to speak our minds and be heard and ask questions without judgment. I am saddened, deeply saddened by the police officer related tragedy that resulted in George Floyd's death in Minnesota.\nSpeaker 1: I have also spent hours and days and years, decades working with police officers as well as victims and their families. Dedicating my entire career to seeking justice and to ensuring that families who are victims of crimes get closure that they deserve when they are the victim of a gang crime, sexual assault, or a homicide, which are my\nSpeaker 1: personal areas of specialty. My life is devoted to the pursuit of justice. And when we see real acts of injustice perpetrated by those meant to serve and protect, it shines a further light on the vast divides we see throughout America today.\nSpeaker 1: I think most Americans can understand the frustration and sense of anger felt by many protesters as they pursue this nation's goal of a more perfect union. I cannot support riots, vandalism or burglaries at any level while local small businesses are struggling during this pandemic.\nSpeaker 1: But I understand the deep feelings of fatigue and frustration in protesters throughout this country that have not seen the prosperity that's been promised to them in the American dream, and instead may feel a sense of an ongoing injustice.\nSpeaker 1: We have recently seen a significant moment in Long Beach develop into a historic movement around the nation to confront real issues and seize on opportunities to improve our existing systems. We have the opportunity to evaluate our current models and make necessary changes for our system to improve.\nSpeaker 1: But we have to do that as we also continue to run our city. We do want residents to feel trust and not be fearful of officers. And we cannot allow for a system that protects those, misuse their powers as defined under the laws and the protections of this nation.\nSpeaker 1: As the city of Long Beach depends on the trust and faith in our police officers and their commitment to working with the community every day to keep us safe. As a councilmember, I'm committed to help our city every day with justice as my guiding principle.\nSpeaker 1: As the Chair of the Public Safety Committee, I will continue to do my part to shine a light on these issues. And in addition to pushing for body worn cameras with my fellow committee members. Councilman Austin and Councilman Super Doll.\nSpeaker 1: And before that, Councilwoman Mango and other tools such as public outreach and education and community policing, which have been topics we have discussed. Our committee is committed to looking at best practices and helping our police department continue to adopt best practices.\nSpeaker 1: I will say that it's been stated a number of occasions already tonight that our police department has continued to evolve and develop best practices in the six years that I have been here. This is reflected in their current statistics, and in my personal opinion, the improvements in the statistics is a direct result of the investment that we\nSpeaker 1: have made in our police department. The commuting, community, policing and transparency measures that we have employed throughout our department has been significant in terms of budget impacts. But those investments have resulted. And better statistics and improvement all around.\nSpeaker 1: There is still a lot more to do. We are a community of many races, ethnicities, life experiences and beliefs. But from this varied spectrum, we share one community, we share one city. And people often talk about this term.\nSpeaker 1: A Tale of Two Cities. I'll be honest, I don't like that because I think it unnecessarily divides us. We are one city with opportunities and challenges in each area of the city. And areas that we need to help promote, build up and support so that we can continue to be better as a city together.\nSpeaker 1: We share a common desire to see our homes safe. Our families protected and representing the needs of everyone, regardless of what part of town they live in. Everyone should expect basic services and protections from their city. Long Beach is a strong community and the peaceful protests we have seen in every corner.\nSpeaker 0: Of this.\nSpeaker 1: City brings so many residents together to support our city, charting a course towards positive changes in the future. I believe that we are one family. Yes, all nine of us, as well as our mayor on this council. We have served together, many of us, for six years.\nSpeaker 1: And I believe that together we can honor the message of needed and prudent and realistic progress. We must act deliberately and with purpose, while bearing in mind that public safety and protection of every resident in this city remains a core responsibility for our city.\nSpeaker 1: I want to say that we are going to, as a public safety committee, start this conversation, this listening, this educating and this exploration of best practices adopted throughout this nation. On June 23rd, when we have our public safety meeting.\nSpeaker 1: I expect to have a number of proposals that I won't be asking the police department to evaluate and consider in terms of adopting some changes for our own public safety teams. This item read beautifully. Councilman Richardson The item was written beautifully and I appreciated the elephant comments of many of my colleagues.\nSpeaker 1: As I shared with Councilwoman Richardson, I do have some questions about some of the specifics of this item. So I'll put it out there, and I'm sure somewhere it'll come back to Councilman Richardson or perhaps the city attorney to weigh in on what exactly are we voting on tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Because, for example, when it comes to the ballot measure, I really don't have any idea about what the ballot ballot measure. Well, I don't even really know what the subject matter of it would be. So that was discussed and I missed it.\nSpeaker 1: I apologize, but I do want to have a conversation about that because I don't feel comfortable voting on something that I've never seen. And we're going to need to do public outreach and communication. And I know that it was referred to the ballot measure being maybe a placeholder so that we can bring a ballot measure in the\nSpeaker 1: future. But I'm not sure from talking with the city attorney whether that's possible without some substance to the item. So with that, I want to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for giving me the opportunity to talk on this topic.\nSpeaker 1: I look forward to hearing from my colleagues and a little bit more specificity on what exactly we're voting on tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is council member Ringo.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor. And everyone is so eloquent tonight in their comments because it's speaking from the heart, just like I was speaking from the heart, just to put a little bit of our historical perspective on things. Of course, remember, again, Vice Mayor Rudy Andrews somewhat brought it up about being involved and having experienced other.\nSpeaker 4: Riots, if you want to call that disturbances that we've had in the past. We certainly had hours here in Long Beach this time around, but we also had one in back in 92 of the Rodney King situation. And then when I was a kid growing up in East Los Angeles, there were the Watts riots that that I\nSpeaker 4: lived through. So we've all had our experiences. But what I can say about Long Beach is that when we had our disturbances here in 92, there were some positive things that came out of the African-American, Latino, Asian communities came out and work together.\nSpeaker 4: We got together to say that, you know, we have issues here in Long Beach we need to work at. We need to do better. We need to improve on it. We can only do it as one community working together.\nSpeaker 4: Oh. As a result of that, we had a new police chief at the time, Tony Batts, and that was the beginning of community policing back in those days and that was strong. We also established back in those days of Community Advisory Committee to the Chief of Police and fire and to the city manager, where we had people\nSpeaker 4: from the community actually meet with police, with police chief and with the city manager to talk about issues of great concern to our communities. And each one was important and added to that. We're the LGBTQ Advisory Group of Seniors Group and other various stakeholders who also met with the police chief and city manager to determine what is\nSpeaker 4: going on and what is it that we need to change in our community to make it better? And we are at a crucial moment now in this point of our history where what's being put at the table today and what we're going to be looking at is an opportunity.\nSpeaker 4: And the opportunity is to once again visit a lot of the the changes that we're implementing before and see how we can make them better or improve upon them or at this time, things that we weren't able to add before because we're in a different era now.\nSpeaker 4: What I discovered the last couple of well, the last week or so that we've been experiencing all these these. Events is that is different. I know we're in the social media age and what's going on is that this this these protests have been much more peaceful, much more peaceful than we've had in the past.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. We've had our moments of of looting and rioting, that sort of. Goes with with everything else but the protests themselves. The protesters in cells were focused and they and they were they were poignant in what they were bringing about and being very attuned to what changes are out there.\nSpeaker 4: And we've now come to accept the fact that a lot of the biases and prejudices that we meet, that we're confronted with are systemic. They've been around for a long time and they've come to the surface. I was reminded this morning of our issue that I marched on and protested back in 1996, which was a proposition to\nSpeaker 4: name the anti-Affirmative Action Program. Our proposal for Proposition eight was put forward by then Governor Pete Wilson. I marched against that. I fought against it. And I wanted to I wanted to get it down because I knew it was wrong.\nSpeaker 4: And what they tried to do was basically saying that affirmative action programs were were illegal and did not serve any purpose. And and getting rid of those kinds of programs would level the playing field. Well, what have we learned in the 26 years between then and now that the level of the playing field is still not level\nSpeaker 4: ? In fact, it is even more a level now than it was even then. And there's an effort now with another bill that's being is which is legislature is to repeal to only because it's still on the books. And that's part of the systemic issues that we're dealing with, is that there are still items on the books that\nSpeaker 4: are counterproductive to where we need to be, to where we need to get. So I'm saying that in providing the historical perspective in the sense that we still have a lot of growing to do, we still have systemic bills and pieces of the legislature that are in need, dire need of change and repeal and new ones to\nSpeaker 4: go forward. And this is our opportunity to do such. I know Councilwoman Pryce mentioned that it was very unclear as to what specifically we might be looking at. But that's I think that's the whole point, is that we need to have that discussion.\nSpeaker 4: We need to look at what we're going to do in the future to make us better, to make the city a lot stronger. We need we are a strong city and I believe in this. I love this town.\nSpeaker 4: I'm not going anywhere. I love every aspect of my community that I've been here, been able to build lifelong friendships since I came to Long Beach as a freshman and Long Beach State and made many of them. And like I say, one of the other one of the other things that we want to look at and it\nSpeaker 4: wasn't institutionalized then, but perhaps this is an opportunity we can do that now, is to institutionalize these advisory committees or advisory groups that we're looking at, because they seem to come and go with whoever is on the sits on the chief's chair or whoever sits on the city manager's chair.\nSpeaker 4: And they and they and they ebb and flow with something that's more permanent or stable so that these discussions are ongoing from here on out, that we don't have to have these types of services and nobody and nobody has to die in order to bring this to the forefront.\nSpeaker 4: We say their names. And Janine, thank you for mentioning seeing all those names because they're a part of our history. And as sad as it makes me feel and at times angry, to want to go out and do something about it.\nSpeaker 4: But we have to do it with logic. We have to do it with data. We have to do it in a way that's such that we is going to be effective. And I have been as an example of great proponent of institutionalizing our health department, for one.\nSpeaker 4: But we also need to look at institutionalizing these types of committees as well, these types of groups that would be provide a voice and a venue for people to come forward and voice your concerns. And it has the city council or manager or the police chief move on them.\nSpeaker 4: So it's this is a beginning. I see this as a start. And it's and it's also, at the same time, a continuation of where we've been before and what we need to get. So please look at this as a as a way of.\nSpeaker 4: Growing as a way of learning and as a way to also. Go again. To get to a place where we need to be. With that, I guess some. Done here. And if I if I had to come back and say something more might come back to me, I don't know.\nSpeaker 4: But at the same time is let's work together. And one of the most proudest moments that I've had thus far is that we have, if not the most, one of the most diverse city councils around. Basically unique. You name a.\nSpeaker 4: A community and is represented in our city council. We have immigrants, sons of immigrants, daughters of immigrants, African-Americans and LGBTQ. We're all represented here. And we are we ourselves are a reflection of our community. And that's what makes us strong.\nSpeaker 4: And that's what's going to keep us strong as long as we keep that focus that we know we have a large community here where half a million people, you're probably grown a little bit more. And it's going to be again for the people out there who are listening.\nSpeaker 4: Important to fill out the census. It's going to be important for us as a city where we apply for these grants and we apply for federal funds that we need to. To move forward with with. With getting getting the sense is that we account for our son.\nSpeaker 4: So with that, I'll leave it. I'll leave it there. I'm sure there's going to be more discussion. And as we move forward with this, we decided we're going to be having a lot more a lot more discussions. And hopefully when we continue these discussions, there'll be we'll be in a better place than we were last week.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilman and Diaz.\nSpeaker 1: You. May I? Thank you very much. First and foremost, I like every American. In the past weeks, I've been absolutely devastated to see another video of an armed, unarmed black person being killed by a officer who is sworn to protect their community.\nSpeaker 1: This is just one of the small pieces of our country's long and violent history of systemic racism and white supremacy, a legacy that continues today to impact every aspect of our society. The revelation so many people have experienced over the past few days.\nSpeaker 1: I think the black community has known and organized the girls for decades, and I think that it's important that we recognize that some of these steps are going or some of the steps were taken right now are long overdue.\nSpeaker 1: I'm so heartened to see the parts of the items that request concrete action in the face of racism and injustice, as we have seen in our streets and around the country. It's not only time to acknowledge the problem, but also to implement solutions.\nSpeaker 1: I look forward to working with my colleagues and staff to create reform in our city from the way we are governing to the way we are policing, to the way we allocate resources to our community. I am proud to stand with each of you in this first step, but I know that there are many more steps to\nSpeaker 1: come and eager to get started. I want to absolutely thank our my council colleagues, council members Richardson, Austin and Andrews for Vice Mayor Andrews for bringing this item forward and also for their their contribution to our city as African American from the black community.\nSpeaker 1: I think it's very important that we see. Them as role models for other generations, them that were elected into these positions and and are able to make certain changes within our city. This is what we need. And I'm very proud to serve on a very diverse city council.\nSpeaker 1: And I, like it's been said by my colleagues before me at times that we may not see eye to eye with each other. But I do believe in from the bottom of my heart that today we stand here before you all in agreeance that something needs to be done.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm I'm very, very proud to be on the city council. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, councilman and de haas councilmember supernova.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. And I'd like to first thank those who brought this item forward. And I'd also like to thank Councilman Richardson, Councilman Austin and Vice Mayor Andrews for their eloquent and heartfelt remarks. I think they serve as a perfect opening to this discussion.\nSpeaker 5: I'm like Vice Mayor Druse and Councilman, you rank. This, too, is my third episode of Civil Unrest involving Long Beach. Um, and I can say that this. The aftermath of this feels very different to me. Uh, Councilman Franco referenced social media.\nSpeaker 5: Perhaps that's it. But this is the first time I.\nSpeaker 3: See this broad.\nSpeaker 5: Recognition of systematic.\nSpeaker 3: Racism. And obviously.\nSpeaker 5: The killing of George Floyd has served as a catalyst to bring us to this moment. Um, I think we have, um, we should be very hopeful. And again, I don't mean to sound repetitious, but maybe it's because we've lived through it.\nSpeaker 5: Councilman here. You were going to mention how there were many changes made after 92. And I'll go back to 1965 and the Watts riots. And, um, in the aftermath of that civil unrest, money flowed to Los Angeles.\nSpeaker 3: Federal dollars flowed in Sacramento.\nSpeaker 5: Dollars flowed in. I'm not sure how many of those dollars made it to what. But I think we can improve upon that. Now, as Councilman Frank said, so many improvements after 92. And maybe this is it. Maybe this is the time where we see everything, the discussions happen, the plans in place.\nSpeaker 5: And as I referenced, we just need systems in place on an ongoing basis to make sure that the changes we enact are sustainable. I don't think it is. Just from my background, I know the coffee of the the chair of the Sustainable City Commission was mentioned.\nSpeaker 5: Having served on that commission for seven years and also served as chair, I think the topic that was brought up generally is environmental justice. So to concentrate just on the things that we're going to throw in the mix here.\nSpeaker 5: Not that that's the only thing, but I feel an obligation to bring that forward. With my background also, I currently serve on the Public Safety Committee and we will be working on that.\nSpeaker 3: As well as Chair Price.\nSpeaker 5: Mentioned on the 23rd. So those are some of the things we'll be bringing forward. For those of you who don't hear me, normally my my signature is brevity. I just didn't want anyone to think that because of my style, that reflects at all on on my position on that.\nSpeaker 5: I choose. This is one of the. Critical moments for our council. One of the most important things that has ever come before us, and I look forward to helping shape these changes for the future. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I want to start by thanking both Mary Andrews, Councilman Austin and Councilman Richardson for your continued leadership in our city. I appreciate the heartfelt comments of all my colleagues. So much has already been said and I won't repeat what has been said.\nSpeaker 1: But I will say that over the last few weeks I continue to listen. I believe that true wisdom comes from listening and that we as a council need to continue to keep listening at the forefront of the policies that we will work towards and develop over the next several months.\nSpeaker 1: The only thing that I have to add is in reading the items and in listening to what? Government agencies and community partners are doing across the country. I see some significant value in coordination and I think that institutionalizing that coordination would be imperative.\nSpeaker 1: We can't do it without our partners. And so if there was a way to ensure that we. As we work through this process, make presentations to our partners, the school boards, the trustees, and for them to make presentations to us on where they're headed so that we can ensure that where our agencies progress crosses, that we institutionalize\nSpeaker 1: the solutions across all of the groups together so that the investment goes the farthest by ensuring it. That we build on each other and their successes and the listening. So with that, I want to thank everyone for their peaceful demonstrations over the last several days.\nSpeaker 1: And. I think that it is poignant that our city is on the forefront of this as we have been on so many things. And it would not be possible without the community leaders that have supported this and so many other equity and equality issues.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, I have I'm going to go back to I think everyone has. Has made their comments. Let me go back to Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Thanks. Mayor, I wanted to just I realize that I left out a part that I wanted to talk about as far as the city's thinking about process. And when we acknowledge structural racism, we acknowledge that so often the black community has not felt like spaces were safe for them, that they were not safe for them to speak\nSpeaker 2: up, that they're not safe for them to participate in. And I reflect back to the land use element and what those spaces were like and also what those spaces were like for our African-American staff. And so I am not sure that Thomas spent a lot of time thinking about what the process will look like in dealing with\nSpeaker 2: this this health emergency. But it is so important that black voices are heard. I would say first that if organizations, even if they seem like organizations that the city has never worked for before, like Black Lives Matter or anybody else says, Hey, City, we're ready.\nSpeaker 2: We're ready to talk and we want to listen that we go to them and that we make sure we engage them in a space that is safe and that they can and work in and that we do that with our youth.\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that you visited our youth yesterday, but really recognizing that for so many this the city isn't the same across the whole city and that we really have to get ourselves out of our comfort zone to hear these these black voices so that we can, you know, change where where we put our priorities.\nSpeaker 2: And we do that with our resources. And that includes city staff time and how we function as a city. So really wanting to make sure that the black community that is diverse is the one leading on this reconciliation.\nSpeaker 2: Otherwise we will not have the trust of our diverse black community and all of this will be just a process. So that's my thoughts. Thanks, guys.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 5: Sorry. It's muted. Okay. So I want to take a minute and just so earlier, I needed to kind of just make sure that I presented the framework correctly. And now I want to just take this opportunity to kind of refocus on what we're trying to do here.\nSpeaker 5: So so one, the reason we put acknowledgment out there first is because what we do and what we say from this moment forward, we can either acknowledge or we cannot acknowledge. And we have to be a model and be an example of how we do that.\nSpeaker 5: So we yes, we are one city and name, but the reality is our systems perpetuate two realities and two different commitments from our city to a race. That experience is not the way to start this process. Ignoring that point means we're not grappling with real issues, which is what this moment demands and is what Long Beach is\nSpeaker 5: clearly demanding. We need to focus on inequities in order to bring equity. If we are truly one city and we and we do not want to be divided. Then we have to look at the disparities and data that divide us and put in strategies to close gaps and bring us closer together.\nSpeaker 5: So yes, we are one city, but this conversation is not about that. This conversation is about the differences so that we can truly be one city. Secondly, in terms of acknowledging history, I think it's important to acknowledge on the front end that we haven't even in the last last five years, we haven't truly acknowledged this stuff.\nSpeaker 5: You know, we're a city that like, it's okay to acknowledge our history and acknowledge that the KKK marched down Ocean Boulevard and Long Beach three years ago. We commissioned a report on economic equity in Long Beach. I commissioned this report.\nSpeaker 5: It acknowledged that history, that language was removed from the report by our city staff. That simple action in and of itself is an example of institutional racism. Therefore, it needs to be called out in that process so that in this process there is integrity.\nSpeaker 5: I want to say that as professionals, we should not be neutral on certain things. Embracing racial equity should be a professional standard, just like acknowledging sexual harassment is a passive professional standard. That standard has evolved over time. Acknowledging sexual harassment in the nineties 1870s looks different than it looks today with MeToo and Time's Up.\nSpeaker 5: This is one of those moments we need to, as professionals, acknowledge that we cannot advance in our organization. You cannot be advancing your career. We can't advance moving forward from this moment without mastering it. And mastering it takes training and acknowledgment.\nSpeaker 5: Acknowledge that institutional racism needs to be named and called out. This is our chance as leaders to change the direction structurally and meaningfully. Also, we should acknowledge that we have. Due to COVID 19, we haven't been able to take public comment.\nSpeaker 5: There are people and voices that want to be heard right now. So we are I know we are taking steps to get back open, but it is important that this listening process is public and on the record. It was mentioned earlier the land use element, when there were a lot of anger around the land use element, the\nSpeaker 5: city stepped forward. The city put up tents and listened to people and let them vent. And that process in and of itself was stand up. And that process had its own integrity. Separate from the speeches that we give as politicians.\nSpeaker 5: The staff owned that process and they listened and they created the work plan from that. Next, we need to clarify the integrity of this process. There are a lot of separate process taking on and off the state legislatures doing things.\nSpeaker 5: I know the federal government is doing things and we are going to watch and track all of those efforts. And that means sometimes our committees, state ledge, fat ledge, public safety committee, all of those have individual committee work directed by individuals, directed by committee members and elected officials.\nSpeaker 5: And those are important and they are relevant to the discussion. But it's important to note that the framework in this motion is directing city staff to have a process separately from all the other processes that are happening. And that process needs to maintain its integrity all the way through and be centered on input from the public listening\nSpeaker 5: process on the record and the convening process that is important to clarify next. I think just, you know, this is a moment where we are redefining what resiliency means is no longer just about preparing for an earthquake. When I walk through Artesia Boulevard, if I look down on Pine Avenue, I see businesses closed due to a pandemic\nSpeaker 5: . When I walk down pineapple today and see board businesses boarded up and murals on there, it tells me that this is is a public health issue, that public health and racial equity, if not addressed, can be as dangerous to our community as an earthquake.\nSpeaker 5: So this is a moment for us to redefine and be an example for our region on how to redefine resiliency and prioritize. Public health, economic inclusion and racial equity is a process that we're setting forward today. It's about translating the voices, the demands of the protests in our community into a strategy for local action.\nSpeaker 5: And that's why public comment on the record is important, that we capture this moment in our city's history, that we acknowledge this moment, we acknowledge our past, and we move forward together. That is incredibly important in this process.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. The last thing I want to say is I want it reflected in this motion. I want it reflected in this motion that this is the city council making a statement that this is considered a public health emergency.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I'm Tom Richardson, and thank you to the entire council for the comments. And it certainly is a a public health emergency. With that, we've concluded our council comments. We have, of course, some other items that are related.\nSpeaker 3: And so if I can, please go ahead and get a roll call. Actually, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 1: So I just want some clarification either from Councilman Richardson or or the city attorney in regards to the ballot measure. Are we voting? Is there anything we're doing tonight in regards to a ballot measure?\nSpeaker 5: I can clarify intent, if that's okay.\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Perfect.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So, as I mentioned in my comments, all of this should be able to land in systems change. And system change to me is defined as changes to charter, changes to the municipal code, changes to city manager pilot policies as well as budget.\nSpeaker 5: All of those are the systems in which guide our government. And so whatever recommendations may come out of that, the instruments to train, change, those all have different requirements, for example, charter change. So we know that the PCC requires a change to the charter.\nSpeaker 5: If you want to eliminate it, if you want to reform it, it requires those things. And so they would have to be preparation for an election if if that is something the city council chooses to do separately. We know that there are certain things, some things that require changes to the municipal code by ballot.\nSpeaker 5: For example, some of our cannabis laws, you know, we don't have a reputation of having a cannabis equity law that is as progressive as it should be due to the limitations placed on us by the voters and how they did that.\nSpeaker 5: That is one example of something we can place on to truly ensure that of the cannabis businesses reinvesting in communities have been impacted by that industry for many, many years. Those are the types of things, types of strategies that may come out of this process, looking at reinvestment of cannabis equity and and looking at barriers in our\nSpeaker 5: system that stop that from happening. And so this motion says, look what the city council in a position based on whatever comes out of this process to take action, don't let the deadlines of ballot measures and all of those things.\nSpeaker 5: Don't let this process stop any of those opportunities for reform. And so we know we have two immediate opportunities in front of us. One is our budget. Two is the upcoming election. And we also know that some things we can just enact outright as a city council, we have the power in some ways to do that.\nSpeaker 5: So that's the the reason I mentioned ballot measure, because that may be a requirement in order to change some systems.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, I get it. That seems pretty clear to me and I thank you for clarifying that. So we're going to do this listening process. We're going to engage in meetings and we're going to talk. And if there are some best practices that we think we want to employ, then we might propose some specific ballot measure, but we\nSpeaker 1: don't know yet what that's going to look like.\nSpeaker 5: We don't know what to make of it. We don't think that's going to be of the process. True.\nSpeaker 2: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Mayor. I wanted to just reflect, Councilmember Richardson, when you asked that your motion be clear that this is a health priority in crisis, that there's also the resolution attached. And I'm not sure when that's going to come back, but I think that it was included in there.\nSpeaker 2: But more importantly, my my question is for staff, there's one piece, you know. Councilmember Supernormal mentioned it. I mentioned it. The health inequities around our environmental piece, the city has done an excellent job of preparing our plan. It has sat on a shelf now for a year.\nSpeaker 2: I know part of that debate because the cap basically says that in order to reach our environmental goals, we have to have a CPA in place. And so it's it's been sitting there for a little bit. When is the timeline coming back on the two from four on the CAP plan?\nSpeaker 2: Because it has a you know, it directly impacts our black community and communities of color. A question for Tom on the Climate Adaptation Action Plan.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, looking to see if Linda Tatum, she was here just a second ago. Linda, there's a question about the cap plan and when that might be coming back. So Linda Tatum will answer that question.\nSpeaker 1: All right. We are preparing a24 from. That'll go out. It'll be sent up to the city manager's office. I have a draft now. We're looking to get that out either this week or next week. And in that, it will outline the the remaining schedule to complete the cap and bring it back to the city council.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thanks. Didn't want to get us too far off topic, but just recognizing that we have some tools and toolbox. Thank you guys. Very excited to take this vote.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilmember Pearce, before we go to a vote, I know that the the city attorney, I think had a had a clarification. I think I know the answer. I know that as far as the city attorney think, you're you're you're you're wondering about the the declaration of emergency.\nSpeaker 3: And I understand that that's not a formal action that the council can take tonight. But I think that Councilman Richardson, correct me if I'm wrong, is talking about this in general terms, that that's what the moment that we're in.\nSpeaker 3: Is that correct? Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. There's a few things. One, it mentions the priority and urgency of the moment. Two, we're already in a COVID 19 pandemic. We know that we're operating under a state of emergency. We have we're connecting based on data.\nSpeaker 5: We know it has a disproportionately disproportionate impact on from the health standpoint in African-Americans, as well as the economic fallout is disproportionately impacting African-Americans and many, many people. So there is a direct connection to the emergency we have.\nSpeaker 5: Those are important in local government to declare and to and to define. So that's what we're doing. So we're not saying declare a new emergency, to be clear. This is directly connected to the emergency you're in and it should be received with the same level of urgency.\nSpeaker 5: That is my point.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, I hope that I hope that I'm interested in turning to that. Clarify it for you.\nSpeaker 6: I believe so. I think that the way I understand the motion is it is not an actual declaration of a health emergency. The council member is saying it could be and some of these actions taken could help assist in the current emergency.\nSpeaker 6: But those emergencies have to be declared by the health officer. And so if if the health officer makes that declaration, then it would come back to council for approval of that declaration. So there's not a formal process that would come back to you unless the health officer declares it a formal emergency.\nSpeaker 6: So as I understand it, the motion tonight are your four items, and there's definitely several items that will be coming back to the council as staff progresses through these phases of the resolution articulating it. The public statement, I think, has already been made the formal listening and then convening the stakeholders and out of that then there'll be\nSpeaker 6: items maybe separately or all at once, depending on how the city manager does it comes back to you for further action. And this is time just to add to that. I think that's right. The way I'm understanding the sense of the council and the motion is you want us to consider this to be one of our absolute\nSpeaker 6: top priorities that we were working on that was loud and clear today. We are committed. We're ready. I do want to point out that that comes with a price. When we put this ahead, we put other things behind.\nSpeaker 6: And so we are going to be taking that action. We will move things around. We will treat this with urgency. You're asking a lot in this motion. I think it's very good. I think it gives us some good structure.\nSpeaker 6: And it's an it is a very aggressive timeline. So we will be putting together structures to to treat it with the importance with which you have all spoken so eloquently tonight. And it is our job then to let you know what the other things that we will have to manage around and we will ask for the council's\nSpeaker 6: patients on that as we prioritize really this our COVID response and our budget, those are our three main things. And I think the point that Councilmember Richardson was making is that there are shared themes in all three of those that can be interwoven together, and we will be looking for those.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Modica. And then as we as we turn to the vote, I would also add this is something that Councilmember Richardson and I have talked about, and I and I agree, and I think we've mentioned this as well.\nSpeaker 3: Mr. Murdoch, I think as you begin to put together this plan, and I think you've acknowledged the importance and the urgency of the plan by the Council, we have incredible talent in this organization. We have incredible our rank and file employees in every single department in the city and managers and leaders that that love this community, that\nSpeaker 3: are part of this community and that and feel the same pain that we talked about tonight. We have a members in our public works crews. We have librarians. We have firefighters. We have all types of employees that really can help lead on this issue.\nSpeaker 3: I'm thinking about our our black or black employees or black managers that really have, I think, a unique perspective. So as we move forward in this process and we move forward to to really put together this framework. I'm also hopeful that we can tap into their immense talent and commitment to our city, because they're going to have\nSpeaker 3: a very unique perspective on the work ahead of us. And so I thank you, Mr. City Manager and the council and to Councilmember Richardson kind of for spearheading this and certainly to Vice Mayor de Andrews, to Councilmember Al Austin for your leadership and Councilmember Pierce for helping also in the coauthoring this item.\nSpeaker 3: We know this was a lot of work and we look forward to getting to work after that. After listening. So thank you all. And with that, we're now going to have the clerk do the roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 0: District one. I district to district three. I strict for. I District.\nSpeaker 1: Five. I.\nSpeaker 0: District six. By District seven.\nSpeaker 7: I.\nSpeaker 0: District eight.\nSpeaker 4: All right.\nSpeaker 0: District nine. District nine.\nSpeaker 3: I got some a record.\nSpeaker 5: This thing is muted. Sorry, I.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Great. Thank you. Much information carries you counsel. We do have a couple of items are still a part of this broader discussion. And thank you all for that conversation on the on the general framework. So now we're going to take up item 26.\n",
        "summary": "Recommendation to request City Attorney to work with City Manager and Long Beach Office of Equity to draft a resolution that articulates the City's commitment to adopting the \"Framework for Reconciliation in Long Beach,\u201d recognizing the need to engage in a public reconciliation process, internal policy review, and local action plan committing to the following four steps: \r\n\r\nRequest City Manager to issue a public statement condemning the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN, acknowledging the existence and longstanding impacts of systemic racism in our America and in Long Beach; \r\n\r\nRequest City Manager to conduct a formal listening process to hear accounts and experiences of racial injustice, inequity, or harm of community members; \r\n\r\nRequest City Manager to convene stakeholders to evaluate the feedback from the listening process and shape policy, budgetary, charter, and programmatic reform ideas; and\r\n\r\nRequest City Manager catalyze action, presenting immediate, short-term, medium-term, and long-term present recommendations for the City Council to consider.",

        "source": "Speaker 2: 11 eyes. 11 eyes. Constable 752 has passed. Councilman. Clerk, will you please put up Council Bill 750 on the floor?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Mr. President. I move that council bills 715 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.\nSpeaker 2: It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill 750 is open. We have the staff report. Teresa Lucero.\nSpeaker 7: So seriously. Sarah With community planning and development, this is a rezoning of 1208 North Quitman Street. The request is to rezone from general urban multi-unit three storey to general urban residential mixed use five storeys. So the property is located in District three in the West Colfax neighborhood.\nSpeaker 7: It is adjacent to the Perry Street Light Rail Station and Lakewood Dry Gulch Park, four blocks south of Saint Anthony redevelopment and Sloan's Lake Park, three blocks west of Colfax Avenue and four blocks north of West Sixth Avenue.\nSpeaker 7: Property is about 10,000, almost 10,500 square feet or about a quarter of an acre. There is a single family structure on the property. The applicant is requesting rezoning to redevelop the property. And again, the request is to go from a multi-unit three storey to a residential mixed use.\nSpeaker 7: Five storey. General Urban is one of our more intense zone districts or sorry not doing districts contexts characterized by multi-unit residential variety of building forms. Low scale commercial imbedded in the area. Commercial uses can be a variety of building forms.\nSpeaker 7: And then the generics five zone district is primarily residential, but there can be a mixture of uses if the mix, if the nonresidential uses are on the first level. Otherwise the structure has to be residential. And if the structure is solely commercial, then the size of the structure is limited to 10,000 square feet and the allowed building\nSpeaker 7: height would be 70 feet. So again, existing zoning is multi-unit. Three land use in the area is a mixture of single and multi-unit residential one, two, three stories. Zoning North gm u three South e t u c which is two unit and open space for the City Park East rx5 and West Open space for the park that's\nSpeaker 7: there, the Liquid Dry Gulch Park. These pictures give you kind of a flavor of the building form and scale. The existing site is the top one. The vacant districts five site to the east is top right. Station itself is bottom right.\nSpeaker 7: Park is bottom left. And then the series of single family homes adjacent to the site are north of the site is top left. Land use in the area mixed between low scale multi-unit and single family. Informational notice on this application went out on April 9th, a planning board hearing and on June 21st.\nSpeaker 7: There, of course, all of the electronic notification and signs were posted correctly for that hearing, and there was a vote of 6 to 3 in favor of recommending approval on this application. This application was also at Land Use Committee on July 11th.\nSpeaker 7: And then, of course, we're here tonight. There are. Three or four local arenas in the area you have in your packet with your staff report 27 postcards and letters in opposition to this and 26 letters in support. And one of the letters of support is from the Sloan's Lake Citizens Group.\nSpeaker 7: So the criteria consistency with adopted plans. We have current plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and the West Colfax Plan, which is a 2006 plan, can't plan, protect and improve air quality by reducing vehicular pollution, by expanding the land use, the use of transit encourage redevelopment of housing that meets the increasing diverse needs of our residents.\nSpeaker 7: Encourage mixed use transit oriented development. And in three different ways. Strategies encourage mixed use and transit oriented development blueprint. Denver The land use concept is urban residential, a higher density primarily residential land use concept with a noteworthy number of commercial uses.\nSpeaker 7: And the subject property isn't within an area of change, which is, of course, where we want to direct growth. Future street classification for equipment is an undesignated local basically tailored to local access. The West Colfax Plan consists of two parts a framework plan and then as district plans.\nSpeaker 7: The framework plan is the part of the plan that tells that the plan tells and should be used for guiding our zoning decisions. The district plan is. Says it does not imply zoning changes but is included to provide guidance for appropriate character and scale in an area.\nSpeaker 7: So within the framework plan. This site is designated an urban neighborhood station, so single family and multi-family residential with development pattern that's variable and compact highest intensity focused around the station platform with a scale of 1 to 5 stories within the plan are also.\nSpeaker 7: Residential growth opportunity areas where existing housing stock is dated and declining and may be appropriate for redevelopment. Land use recommendations include establishing zoning tools that provide for a mix of building types and uses, promoting a range of housing types, supporting infill development and mixed use projects, particularly at the station areas.\nSpeaker 7: And to the greatest extent possible, focus both structural and use intensity at Main Streets, transit stations and town centers. So this is a picture of the plan in the the future land use concept in the West Colfax Plan, urban neighborhood station.\nSpeaker 7: As you can see residential growth opportunity area on there urban design concept map. So within the district plan, the plan tells us to establish appropriate regulatory conditions and incentives to facilitate the redevelopment of the Villa Park and West Colfax neighborhoods near rail facilities, and talks about the pace of development in the area.\nSpeaker 7: And again, this is a 2006 plan. Light rail started in 2013, so it pre-dates light rail, but talks about how development in this area might be gradual because there are not large assemblages of property. So staff believes that this request is consistent with the area plans that by using our standard zone district we are furthering the uniformity\nSpeaker 7: of district regulations and by establishing more development at our transit stations, we're contributing to hopefully helping our air quality and contributing to further furthering public health, safety and welfare. And by implementing our plans, we're doing the same. Justifying circumstances is changed.\nSpeaker 7: Conditions, the land or surrounding environments has changed or is changing to a degree that it's in the public interest to encourage redevelopment. Of course, where you have the light rail that opened in 2013, the redevelopment of the Saint Anthony site, also within this area in just the last three years, we have eight new multi units built in\nSpeaker 7: just the blocks adjacent to this block and this block. And we have four more under review. So we're seeing rather rapid redevelopment of the area based on the MMU three zoning. So staff believes this is an appropriate changed condition and an appropriate justifying circumstance.\nSpeaker 7: We didn't already talk a little bit about the general urban context, promoting safe, active, pedestrian oriented, diverse areas, enhancing convenience and enjoyment of transit, walking shopping, ensuring new development contributes positively to excuse me, to establish neighborhoods and other our five zone district primarily intended for residential uses and with that staff recommends approval of this application.\nSpeaker 7: And of course, I'm here for questions.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Miss Lucero. All right. We have seven speakers for this council. Bill. Two are identified as speaking for 6 minutes because someone else gave their time. So I'm going to call all I'm going to call the first five.\nSpeaker 2: When I call your name, please come to the first bench to save a little time. Bruce O'Donnell. Brandon Gill. Justin Herman. John Buckner. The second and Laurie Smith. Bruce O'Donnell, you first.\nSpeaker 13: Good evening again, Mr. President, of members of council. And unlike the eclipse, I'm coming around again more, more quickly, I guess, this evening. Thank you for your time tonight. This site, 12 Quitman is immediately adjacent to and in fact abuts the RTD W Line rail platform at the Perry Street Station.\nSpeaker 13: And so it's a tremendous total opportunity. In fact, nine months ago, the city of Denver rezone the adjacent property to the east. 1209 Perry Street to the same gr x five zone district in the fact pattern is identical here the it's adjacent to rail.\nSpeaker 13: There is significant plan support and in fact the West Colfax Plan from 2006 is explicit and unambiguous and it says it wants to see buildings one, two, five stories in height at this exact location. So we have had numerous meetings with two RINO's we can the West Colfax, R.A. and also the Sloan's Lake Citizen Group.\nSpeaker 13: This site is embedded wholly in both of those no boundaries. And the Sloan's Lake Citizens Group took action in support of this rezoning request. We can does not do that. In any event, in his is knowledgeable about this but does not take a position.\nSpeaker 13: In addition to that, we have 25 letters of support, most of those from property owners in the neighborhood. As Teresa Lucero from CPD explained. There's been tremendous change going on in this neighborhood in in fact, right today there are 21 site development plans that have either been approved or are under review, transforming this neighborhood primarily in multi-story\nSpeaker 13: buildings north of here between 12th Avenue and 13th Avenue. As was stated, there has been some some opposition from neighbors as well in this opposition is primarily been over heights, allowed of five stories in this group's five zone district.\nSpeaker 13: And we've listened to those neighbors and considered their input. And in response to that, last week recorded a protective covenant and deed restriction on this property that should this zoning pass this evening, the deed restriction would limit building heights to four storeys at this site.\nSpeaker 13: And so while x five would allow five, we've committed that we would only be able to go to four with this protective covenant. So we hope that that's a good balance between the two D objectives and the plan support and the justifying circumstances.\nSpeaker 13: And that compromising on four storeys makes sense in the neighborhood. That also allows us to take advantage of the total opportunity and implement the city's comprehensive plan. I want to reiterate that this rezoning application meets every review criteria that Council is asked to consider.\nSpeaker 13: It has plan support and it has justifying circumstances. It has a recommendation of approval from the Planning Department and also from the Planning Board. And so, in summary, I ask that you weigh that criteria and consider the covenants reducing it to four storeys and vote to approve this rezoning this evening.\nSpeaker 13: Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell. Brant and Gil. You have 3 minutes. Oh, actually, yeah. Come to the mike. Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. I'm Brandon Gayle. I'm the property owner. I actually didn't.\nSpeaker 2: Elect to speak. I was just here to answer any questions. Thank you. Justin Herman, you have 3 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I live just to the.\nSpeaker 11: North of the property.\nSpeaker 1: The one thing that was kind of stressed in the planning.\nSpeaker 2: Can you introduce yourself for the record, please?\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\nSpeaker 11: Justin Herman, I live at 1246 equipment.\nSpeaker 1: One thing that was stressed in the.\nSpeaker 0: Planning development meeting was.\nSpeaker 1: That this.\nSpeaker 12: Would keep the character of the neighborhood. There's no five story buildings within 200 feet of this property or even.\nSpeaker 1: Really visible from this property unless you go to Colfax.\nSpeaker 0: You know, just because the property of the East was rezone doesn't mean that it's right for the neighborhood. Yes, there's development going on.\nSpeaker 1: The.\nSpeaker 0: Immediate area. But again, five story zoning is not consistent with the rest of the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 11: Three stories, kind of.\nSpeaker 1: The max that you see there. And you know that I think it would just kind of look.\nSpeaker 0: Out of place. To be honest with you.\nSpeaker 11: The compromise.\nSpeaker 13: That they talked about.\nSpeaker 0: Would only.\nSpeaker 1: Limit the height restriction for 20 years. So it doesn't talk about anything. What what would happen with after that? You know, if they built a building that.\nSpeaker 12: You could add on top of that would increase then.\nSpeaker 1: In height and.\nSpeaker 0: Support the commercial aspect of the property.\nSpeaker 1: But again, the height is kind of more of the main issue here.\nSpeaker 11: I would increase parking.\nSpeaker 0: There's already kind of an issue with parking on the street just with the way that the properties are designed. And now they have garage garages that face equipment. So parking, that street parking is already kind of limited with higher density, but also increase to this issue that you already have on the street.\nSpeaker 12: People park on the street, walk to the light rail.\nSpeaker 1: Station and, you know, it's kind of an issue. So again.\nSpeaker 0: I would recommend the applicant amend their request.\nSpeaker 13: To grx3.\nSpeaker 11: Zoning. I know that.\nSpeaker 0: It wasn't available when they made the initial application, but it is available now. And so that that would be my recommend recommendation to the Council.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Miss Herman. John Buckner.\nSpeaker 11: Good evening, Council members. Mr. President. My name is John W Buckner, the second I'm the homeowner at 1267 Equipment Street. I appreciate the opportunity today to speak on behalf of my fellow neighbors and opposition to the proposed rezoning of 12 away equipment three property.\nSpeaker 11: My property is just outside the 200 feet radius to sign the official protest. However, I trust my concerns will be heard by this council if I believe this proposed development will negatively affect the lives of those within the radius and its surrounding area.\nSpeaker 11: I've been a homeowner on Quitman since 2013, just before the light rail came in. At this time there were a total of 22 homes on the cul de sac, plus or minus two, and we're calling from memory some duplexes.\nSpeaker 11: For reference, the 1200 block of women dead ends on the south side of the street into the Perry Street light rail station has been mentioned since 2013. Three single family homes on our block have been scraped and in their place, an eight unit condominium development has already been completed on one lot.\nSpeaker 11: And construction is underway for another 12 units on the other two lots. Likewise, the home directly next to mine has been sold to the same developer I just mentioned who erected the new eight unit condominium development with plans to build an identical eight unit condominium structure where a single family home once stood.\nSpeaker 11: In total, the development on our block has added 25, I should say, had and will add 25 new homes to our cul de sac, raising the total to 47 homes on a block that once held 22. This is not including the proposed unit in the building we are here to oppose.\nSpeaker 11: And it is important to note that all of the new proposed development at 12 away Equipment Street, all of them except for the proposed development equip the street have conform to the.\nSpeaker 1: Existing GMU.\nSpeaker 11: Three zoning. My fellow my fellow residents who are opposed to the proposed zoning will speak to the inconsistency with the character of the neighborhood that agr5 development will create, as well as this gentleman speaking to the infrastructure challenges.\nSpeaker 11: I echo their sentiment as neighborhood elders can barely recognize their community as it is. And although one could contend that development is a benefit resulting in a higher property value for each of us, and that development in our neighborhood was inevitable outcome due to the Denver's sustained growth in our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 11: Proximity to downtown, however development have we, as we have experienced it, is both a benefit and a curse. Thus, in addition to the character issues this proposed structure will cause. I'd like to raise the topic of infrastructure as it pertains to the proposed rezoning and the challenges and frustrations of this proposed development will create for current residents\nSpeaker 11: as well as their new neighbors. I know personally of neighbors who can no longer grow gardens due to the height of GMU three buildings, let alone five casting shadows or four in this case casting shadows over the dwarfed one storey homes.\nSpeaker 11: Parking on our block is increasingly challenging as more residents occupiers, street developers build largely one car garages for multiple occupancy homes like real commuters who do not live on equipment, treat the street like a park and right already occupying vital spaces on an already cramped street and making some simple activities like unloading groceries or putting trash on\nSpeaker 11: the curb. A hassle for homeowners that least structure.\nSpeaker 2: Your time is up.\nSpeaker 11: In 3 minutes goes quick. If I may just conclude in saying that I appreciate you sharing my considerations and I appreciate your consideration in weighing these options.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Buckner. Laurie Smith, you have 6 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah.\nSpeaker 8: Oh, no, you don't.\nSpeaker 2: Perhaps someone with you can put it together while you're getting going. Here we go. Yeah, we can see that. I wanted to fight. You want to go to the mic right here and then introduce yourself for the record?\nSpeaker 4: Okay. My name is Laurie Smith. You've probably all received emails from me in some form. I have an I'm an owner at 1275 Tennyson and have a contract under a house under contract on Perry Street, all within four blocks of this property.\nSpeaker 4: Which is why I'm interested party. I want to do two things. First of all, I want to set the context of what we're looking at within that 200 feet boundaries of the property zone of the property. I'm going to walk over here and I'm going to speak.\nSpeaker 2: We you know, we actually need you in the mike. And so if someone can just can hold that for her as be great. Excellent. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: All right. So within this 200 feet, the yellow represents the parts that the city owns. The slashed green represents the part that developers own. And this the slash, the purple horizontal slash represent the part that are owned. But nobody that people don't live there.\nSpeaker 4: They're being rented out. The owners don't live there. They're being rented out. The red represents the part that are owner residents, and those are the people that signed the petition against this rezoning. So within 200 feet. Every owner except to sign the petition.\nSpeaker 4: One has a conflict of interest. In the other two, we could just never contact. We could never get a hold of. So I want that. I want that to be. I want you to see how many people within that area are against this free zone.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. The second thing I would like to do is talk about finding that balance between increasing density around, particularly around light rail stations. Balancing that with preserving the look and character of our community and our neighbor neighborhood. I'm pro-development, but it's got to be wise and thoughtful, not patchwork.\nSpeaker 4: We've got to have a plan. It has to make sense. So if you look through all those city of Denver plans, comprehensive plan, blueprint plan, West Colfax Plan, Todd Plan and the Denver zoning zoning of 2010 and reviewed and revised in 2017, you see a push pull between achieving greater density, especially around light rail stations or transit\nSpeaker 4: stations and preserving the character of the neighborhood. So our our neighbors are the group of us are trying to strike that balance as you are and as the city is. That's important. Okay. So we feel that the gr3 is striking that balance, that particular property is going from a single unit to if it goes to three stories\nSpeaker 4: , it will end with the shop front. Our X is the shop front on the first floor and then the next two floors are residential. If it goes to that, that will change the zoning density from one to up to 20 units, which is a dramatic increase in density.\nSpeaker 4: The three story. We believe part of it will still be able to preserve that character of the neighborhood, which is one, one, two, three. And we acknowledge that the applicant has made an offer. We feel like that has no teeth.\nSpeaker 4: I've talked with city council staff and I've talked with our R.A. and both said, unfortunately, it's a gesture that would be very difficult to enforce if the eventual developer, which we understand the owner, is not the eventual developer, if that eventual developer does not abide by this attached covenant.\nSpeaker 4: Um, again, we are we it is really important to us to preserve the character of that, of that neighborhood character. And look, the neighborhood, which is all 1 to 3 stories. Lots of those homes have been redone, including the for the for next to this property.\nSpeaker 4: And then there, you know, other other properties as well that have been remodeled. I want to quote Mayor Hancock from a July 10th speech. Begin, quote, Development shouldn't happen to us. It should conform to our values. Here's how we're making it happen.\nSpeaker 4: Residents are partnering with the city to preserve the look and character of their neighborhoods. The city's partnering with the neighborhoods to determine their futures through neighborhood plans, which we need to update our Colfax plan. And neighborhoods are partnering with the city and developers to find ways to build projects that provide the stores and services that residents need\nSpeaker 4: . Again, development shouldn't happen to us. It should conform to our values. And here's how we're making it happen. Residents are partnering with the city to preserve the look and character of their neighborhoods. So again, I would ask that you would oppose the request of g, rx5 and that you would recommend that the applicant reapply for grx3.\nSpeaker 4: I did it. I got it.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So much. I really appreciate.\nSpeaker 2: It. Okay. I'm going to ask the the five that are up here to grab your seats. And we have two more, Stephanie Wickman and Mr. Siku and Stephanie Wickman. You are first. You have 3 minutes.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. Thank you for allowing me to speak. My name is Stephanie Wickman. I live at 1218 Quitman Street. This is the property directly adjacent to the north of the property in question. I am the homeowner and resident at 1218 Quitman.\nSpeaker 3: I've lived at 1218 equipment for ten years. At the time of my purchase in 2007, the light rail, I knew about it. It was underway. I've I've weathered the construction and enjoyed the, the perks of the new station.\nSpeaker 3: But when I purchased in this neighborhood, it was in large part due to the charm and character of the existing structures, mostly single family, Victorian or bungalow type homes. Mine being a Victorian built in 1892. There are four currently Victorians in a row directly to the north of this property and we're all one, one and a half\nSpeaker 3: storeys. My concern. Somewhat selfish is the shadow or lack of sunlight that my property will receive. With the development of a five storey up to 75 foot tall structure that with the GM x five, if I understand correctly, can build completely to the lot lines.\nSpeaker 3: So this would block not only sunlight, but also views to to the south for my property and my neighbors to the north. I support the recommended GM x three. Request of some of my fellow neighbors. And I am also the person, the person who gathered the petition of protest signatures, four of six resident owners within 200 feet\nSpeaker 3: , and that represents 12 of the properties within 200 feet of the subject. Property. So I'm here also speaking on their behalf because I spoke to each of these property owners, my neighbors directly, and we all have share the same concerns.\nSpeaker 3: Not only the term and character of the existing neighborhood, but the parking as that has been mentioned before. Parking is a large issue on our street. It is a cul de sac with a large area turn around for fire department vehicles at the bottom.\nSpeaker 3: That allows no street parking for a majority of of that. And I've already seen. Oh, my time is up. Well, thank you.\nSpeaker 2: That 5 seconds when.\nSpeaker 3: I use it. Thank you. And I just want to say, I. To me, quality of life is more important to the than the property value.\nSpeaker 2: Now, your times are Miss Workman. Thank me. Thank you. Yeah. Mr. Psycho messed up.\nSpeaker 8: Time starts when I start talking, right?\nSpeaker 2: I'm talking now.\nSpeaker 8: I just want to set it up properly. Okay. Everybody knows who I am.\nSpeaker 2: For the record.\nSpeaker 8: For the record, my name is Chairman Sekou, not Sekou. Chairman Sekou. And I am the founder organizer for the Black Star Action Movement, which is a public advocacy group for poor, working, poor, homeless and senior citizens. Okay. Baseball.\nSpeaker 8: Two strikes. I got one more strike. We're going to try this one more time, only we're going to make it basic. Paul, I need your help with this. We have a test for city council. It is to see if you are paying attention to us.\nSpeaker 8: And I believe there's a president. BROOKS If I'm not correct, there's a 160 rule that city councilman tells about in terms of you got to pay attention. Otherwise, this stuff can be overthrown and thrown out of court. Every decision you make is a 160 rule.\nSpeaker 8: And we used to bust Charlie Brown up in here. You remember Charlie Brown. You almost had a heart attack. We caught him reading sports page. Well, there was public hearing. And then Charlie had this issue, medical issue with his feet where he had neuropathy and he had these cowboy boots and he would not wash his socks.\nSpeaker 8: And when he took off his shoes to spread his feet, it would be so funky up in here. We could smell it all the way to the back of the room. And so we had to go get this spray to be scary.\nSpeaker 8: And he would call who peo potpourri before you go to the toilet?\nSpeaker 2: 750 We want to talk to the bill.\nSpeaker 8: 750 spoke to it. So we're getting it. So here we go. Help me pour five words. Repeat after me. Help me. Just so I know, you pay the rent.\nSpeaker 2: It was a cycle.\nSpeaker 8: Wait, wait. Speak to the bill. This is the bill. This is a bill.\nSpeaker 2: You're speaking to a council person.\nSpeaker 8: Work with me. The rent is too high. You said. No, this is the one. I'm going to give you a heart attack. The rent is too high. The rent is too high. The rent is too high. The rents too high.\nSpeaker 8: The risk too high. The rent is too high. We cannot afford it. Poor people. Now, this is a solution. And this called them for help because they're getting ready to have a heart attack up here because they pro-development rent control.\nSpeaker 8: What they tell you best. Rent control is the solution to the problem of development because it has to be planned according to recent not 2000 to not 2014. Whatever that I'm talking about right now with the influx of the marijuana, people are coming in.\nSpeaker 8: You've got to have 10,000 people every month where you put them and then you replaced mistakes. Thank you. Those who can afford it. Thank you. The rate is too high. Thank you. Rent control is the only. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Laker. All right. Rent control is illegal in the state of Colorado. Just for just justice, for fact. Just tell the tell you right amendment. I have I have a question.\nSpeaker 2: This is we're in question time now. And I have a question, Nate Lucero, because this has come up a couple of times around the legal protest. Where are we in this bill with the legal protest?\nSpeaker 12: So the manager of CPD has made a determination that the protest petition that was filed didn't meet the requirements.\nSpeaker 2: And what's the threshold? Just for folks.\nSpeaker 12: So it's I believe in Theresa may knows better than me. So if I'm wrong, she could correct me. But I believe it's 20% of the owners within the area to be re zoned or 20% of the owners within 200 feet of the property to be resolved.\nSpeaker 7: That correct owners of 20% of the area.\nSpeaker 2: 20% of the area. Okay. And so I just wanted to state it for the record, because we did get some communication that it was legal practice and it wasn't. And so just for the record, it's not a legal protest, but if it was, it would had to have met 20% of the area.\nSpeaker 7: Correct?\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. All right, Councilman Black.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. I have a long list of short questions. The neighbors. If anyone wants to answer my question, did you all oppose the rezoning of the lot next door that is now rezoning x five?\nSpeaker 1: Across the street.\nSpeaker 2: Is there a.\nSpeaker 3: Answer that.\nSpeaker 7: You have.\nSpeaker 2: To go you've got to come to the mike. Mike and maybe a neighbor representative. Yeah. Come on up to the mike. Thank you. Introduce yourself again.\nSpeaker 4: I'm Laurie Smith. And had we known, had we been aware of that, we would have protested. Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: So. All right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: And and I would say that some labor should probably stay here, and you're probably gonna get a lot of questions.\nSpeaker 3: So the rest of your neighborhood is zoned GMU three. And so I know Mr. Buckner was talking about the kinds of density development that is going in that does comply with that, that zone district. So I heard from you that you're not happy with that, but it's already zoned that way.\nSpeaker 3: So you know this. Whatever happens tonight, the rest of that can still happen. So I just want. Are you aware of that?\nSpeaker 11: We are not.\nSpeaker 1: Opposing the.\nSpeaker 11: Current model of redevelopment. It does fit within our region. Although I did cite some instances of the gee, the three story units at this point causing some conflicts for people as far as overshadowing their own homes. We recognize that in the spirit of Denver and where it's heading, this is consistent with what's happening in Denver.\nSpeaker 11: Five stories in our neighborhood is unheard of. And then we think we'd also present the other problems that we recommended that are on this street, in particular with the cul de sac. The number of units that would be included in a five story building versus a three story building will add significantly more numbers of cars on the\nSpeaker 11: street without any parking for them. Not to mention the challenges that we have with the light rail itself. The last plan for our area was ten years ago, prior to the light rail coming in, and I don't think anyone foresaw Quitman Street after the Perry Street Station named for Perry.\nSpeaker 11: But the train actually pulls in on Quitman being as heavily trafficked as it is right now for parking people, leaving their cars, not paying a fee and driving into the city excusing, taking the train into the city. So it's not the three story structures that we are opposed to.\nSpeaker 11: It is changing that everyone that has come into our area thus far has stayed within that range of three. Five would be unheard of in our neighborhood.\nSpeaker 3: So is is your primary concern the parking? Is that your biggest.\nSpeaker 0: No.\nSpeaker 11: I would say parking is second to the character of the neighborhood. My home was built in 1890 as well. So the many of us bought in this neighborhood for the sheer fact that it was single family homes, traditional homes, bungalows and Victorians.\nSpeaker 11: People take great care in restoring these homes. And what's happening is that a lot of these people are then being forced out of these homes based on the the cost of taxes as they go up and other things.\nSpeaker 11: And those are all subsidiary factors here. But ultimately, it is the character of the neighborhood that we think is at cost most. But I won't say that that's.\nSpeaker 1: Not the only.\nSpeaker 11: Factor, because the parking is also becoming a huge problem as a result of people going outside of what is traditionally accustomed to in this common in these in this neighborhood.\nSpeaker 3: So one final question. So the GMU three. Really is what I'm hearing from you. This is a question is is that's really inconsistent with your neighborhood of single family homes.\nSpeaker 11: It is. And it is inconsistent. But we all recognize that in a three story home that does bring retail to our neighborhood, which could very much change the dynamics of our neighborhood and does stay consistent with what we see happening along the light rail line.\nSpeaker 11: It is also consistent to our partners in the north at Saint Anthony and I will say the St Anthony's a very different community around Sloan's Lake than what we have in our sleepy neighborhood just south of Colfax. So some similarities there.\nSpeaker 11: So, yes, we do see that it is inconsistent with the neighborhood, but is really the height that is dramatically inconsistent. It's not the effort to bring in retail in addition to homes.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So what I was referring to, though, is the GMU three, that the current zoning of your neighborhood is inconsistent with the character of your neighborhood because you're talking about the single family homes and the Victorian homes. And so the current zoning you have really.\nSpeaker 11: It is extremely inconsistent, however, consistent with Denver as far as what Denver is doing around the entire city, as far as where properties are going, we're all getting the shipping container look in our properties. I think we all recognize shipping containers with third stories.\nSpeaker 11: Yeah, it's not that the we're opposing, it's the five story 70 feet and a neighborhood that traditionally had single family, one and a half storey bungalows now going five stories 70 feet and right along Lakewood Gulch. So, yes, we do think that is very inconsistent.\nSpeaker 11: I understand your point. The Jimmy three is also inconsistent with the neighborhood, but not to that extent.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. All right. You have more. You want to come back? Okay. Councilman Ortega.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. Let me first ask Andrew Webb. Are you still here or that was you. Okay, sorry about that. So the. There was reference made to the Greeks zoning category that it's now available. So originally there was no gr3 and in the last bundle we created the Greeks three zone district.\nSpeaker 7: I think that's the. What, though, was that available when this application was filed? Uh. Where's Bruce? Mr. O'Donnell, can you answer that question? I'm not sure you're next on my list anyway, so.\nSpeaker 13: Grace three was not available at the time we filed the application. It was made available more recently.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. So let me ask you my other questions. So the this is a 10,480 square foot lot, correct? 0.024.\nSpeaker 13: Yes.\nSpeaker 7: Point two. Four acres. So first of all, on the 20 year covenant that would be placed on the property. Has that been filed or at what point would that be filed?\nSpeaker 13: Yes, I personally filed in the clerk in recorder's office last Thursday.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And that is for 20 years, correct?\nSpeaker 13: It might be 25. I'll double check, but it's not in perpetuity.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 7: Councilman Lopez is saying he's reading something that says it's 25. Right. Okay. So that that goes with the land for the next 25 years, regardless of who owns it, correct?\nSpeaker 13: Correct.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. And then in terms of the number of units that could be on this site. So we're talking about four stories. So people keep saying it's five stories, but your covenant caps it at four.\nSpeaker 13: Yes, that's correct.\nSpeaker 7: Does that include your age back and all of that stuff on top?\nSpeaker 13: So the the way the covenant reads is that it's four stories and also 55 feet, and that would cover all of parapets, age, HVAC, mechanical, all that type of thing would be within that limit.\nSpeaker 7: Does that include like rooftop patios, everything? Yes. Okay. And then how many how many units can you get into that? That amount of.\nSpeaker 0: Properly.\nSpeaker 13: We haven't studied that yet, but it's anticipated that the ground floor would be all parking, likely with three floors of residential units above. And so maybe in the 15 to 18 range of total.\nSpeaker 7: In. So I know that oftentimes a a lender will not provide financing if you don't have some parking on your development. I'm just saying, you're looking at 15 units. What what is the anticipated number of parking spaces per unit?\nSpeaker 13: Most likely one per unit.\nSpeaker 7: And are we talking about predominantly one bedroom, two bedroom.\nSpeaker 13: So some mix of that there. I want to be cautious in this discussion. There is no development plan today.\nSpeaker 7: I understand. I understand that. But schematically, I mean, you can we're trying to figure out what you can actually fit on the site. Right.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Um. I think those are all the questions I have right now.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman do.\nSpeaker 1: Theresa, a couple questions, please. On the planning board. Three members voted against this rezoning. What were the reasons or the issues they talked about?\nSpeaker 7: It was the tension between the framework plan and the West Colfax Plan and the District Plan in the back that talks about the character in the framework plan. Is the urban residential station or urban? I can't remember the exact term, but the station 1 to 5 stories.\nSpeaker 7: But in the district plan in the back talks about gradual change in the neighborhood, discrete changes. And it was that tension. Some members believed that. This was too intense of a change.\nSpeaker 1: Do they, do they have a discussion about the height of this project or.\nSpeaker 7: Well, yes. Whether the discussion was because the plan talks about discrete changes in that I want to talk about, say, the back part of the plan. And so what's discrete the discussion was, is five 3 to 5 discrete.\nSpeaker 1: So the property adjacent Councilman Black was talking about that was done. There was reason ten months ago that I hear this.\nSpeaker 7: Unanimously.\nSpeaker 1: And I hear Rose's word. Did not know about it. Was there no notification of that?\nSpeaker 7: There's always notification if some.\nSpeaker 1: And here we did you Hamlet?\nSpeaker 7: Yes, I did.\nSpeaker 1: Was there any opposition to that?\nSpeaker 7: No.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. How did council vote on that?\nSpeaker 7: Unanimously.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, the. But that the summer questions. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman and Councilman Castro.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. First questions for Attorney Lucero. The covenant that we're hearing about, is it in? Does it in fact. Limit development on this parcel to four stories for 25 years.\nSpeaker 12: KELLERMAN Katherine, I have not reviewed that deed restriction. So I can't say whether or not it does. It's a private covenant that was inflicted upon the property by the developer. It's not something that's required by the zoning.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Mr. O'Donnell, please. Do you refresh my memory? Are you involved with the partial to the East? That was recent?\nSpeaker 13: Yes, I was the owners rep for that rezoning.\nSpeaker 6: And is there a development planned for that parcel at this point?\nSpeaker 13: It has been in to the city for a concept review.\nSpeaker 6: I'm wondering if there would be a possibility of a covenant on that parcel as well. Have you considered that at all?\nSpeaker 13: Well, I have nothing to do with it.\nSpeaker 6: It's okay. It's out of your hands at this, correct? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. See if I have. Anything else? No, that's all I have. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Counselor Flynn.\nSpeaker 9: Thanks, Mr. President. Teresa on the. The 200 foot radius and the. The requirements for legal protest. As I'm looking at the the document that we were given in the staff, the new staff report. In the calculation of total land area of which you need 20%.\nSpeaker 9: Do we include the park? We do. And the RTD light rail?\nSpeaker 7: We do.\nSpeaker 9: So in other words, to get 20%, we in many cases, we might have to get the city to sign off on a legal protest. Do we include the streets?\nSpeaker 7: We do include streets.\nSpeaker 9: So when we count the square footage of the folks who signed the protest, do we count the square footage just of the parcel they own, or do we count out to the middle of the street?\nSpeaker 7: We count the parcel they own?\nSpeaker 9: Okay, so the streets always count against a protest. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 12: Councilman Flynn, I'm glad you brought that up because that was one of the I've stressed that before. When the when the community is successful, I will have questions for you, Theresa. But after first, actually for you, actually. But that 20% is very, very difficult to achieve because particularly when you're adjacent to right of way big right away\nSpeaker 12: and public entities that own property. If we were to actually do the numbers here, there are 21. If you look at that map, there are 21 parcels, seven have complete. So a third of them had satisfactory signatures. One had a split, four had rejected signatures.\nSpeaker 12: So between a third and half of the actual property owners that weren't public entities or streets did in fact sign. But that threshold of 20%, I mean, I would be happy to for us to reconsider how we we define that.\nSpeaker 12: So questions for that was just follow up to Councilman Flynn. Are you aware that sounds like citizens group like we can does not take positions.\nSpeaker 7: No. Because they didn't take a position on this rezoning.\nSpeaker 12: No. Their letter only gave the results of a straw poll. Okay. But it's really frustrating for me personally, because I wish they did take positions because because because of the fact that the city has put us in this situation and we have a tool to codify these sorts of tweaks through the waivers and conditions process.\nSpeaker 12: But since we don't use them in this situation, we enter into these public, private I mean, these private party agreements. And when you have an R.A. that doesn't take a position, it makes it very, very difficult. We've been successful, but only because we have bids in our nose that take positions, so to speak.\nSpeaker 12: So I do have other questions. Perry, are Perry equipment in the same street classification? No. What is Perry?\nSpeaker 7: Perry is a collector.\nSpeaker 12: And equipment is a local. So those are very, very different in the eyes of the zoning code, are they not?\nSpeaker 7: In some cases, yes.\nSpeaker 12: No. But are X is something is a new sort of is a sort of different animal. The but so in looking at the adopted plan justification, the AMAX has a storefront and we've talked a lot about the sort of mixed use, but all the plans point to urban residential where there is no mention that's single-family and multifamily\nSpeaker 12: . How did CPD come to this idea that a mixed use zone district with storefront and nonresidential uses was a was consistent with an urban residential use?\nSpeaker 7: I'm not getting your question. I think.\nSpeaker 12: Specifically on your slide deck.\nSpeaker 7: Which one?\nSpeaker 12: They're not numbers. It's the one said review criteria, consistency with adopted plans.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. That might be. Well, okay.\nSpeaker 12: Actually. Let's go to the next slide first.\nSpeaker 7: Justifying circumstances.\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, it says urban station. Urban neighborhood station, single family and multi-family residential. It doesn't say, oh.\nSpeaker 7: I don't think I'm on the same slide as you.\nSpeaker 12: Further earlier in the presentation, we're talking about consistency with adopted class. Still further.\nSpeaker 8: Well, it's.\nSpeaker 2: Perhaps you can just just outline it there.\nSpeaker 12: One more right there. So the very first thing we're talking about, the West Colfax framework plan and it talks there's there's really. All the other plans roll up into this urban, residential, urban, urban neighborhood station. Urban, residential. There is some talk about.\nSpeaker 12: Mixed use projects, but our mixed use zoning is specific for those collectors, not for the local residential streets, are they not?\nSpeaker 7: Well, I'd have to pull out my code. But some of our mixed use is, as you know, from the last time I was here on the church or on local streets, like two X in particular.\nSpeaker 12: So that would be a two storey zone district is sort of far less intensive. I mean, by design that is what are zoned it district is for an s sort of context a suburban, you know, a single unit context.\nSpeaker 7: Well, that was an urban context. Yes.\nSpeaker 12: I mean, yeah, I'm sorry, but a single unit context or a t you context, we would go into it in a two zone district. Does that mean we don't use it to vaccinate in a in a in downtown Denver pharmacy?\nSpeaker 12: So I'm just trying to understand how CPD came to me to equate a local. I mean, treat Quitman the same as it did Perry, which are two dramatically different streets when these two plans this slide in the slide before talk about how these new zone districts is since clearly in the slide before this.\nSpeaker 12: It says the district plans quote do not imply zoning changes. So we're in a situation where we have a Jim U3, which is an urban residential zone district, and we're electing to go into a mixed use zone district.\nSpeaker 12: It's mixed use lite. Granted. Granted. But the plans don't say mixed use on local streets. So how did CPD come to the conclusion that this was appropriate?\nSpeaker 7: I think because of the adjacency to the transit station.\nSpeaker 12: But this is not oriented to the transit station. It is oriented to equipment going.\nSpeaker 7: To be oriented.\nSpeaker 12: Can you orient a building to the adjacent properties owned by RTD? Mm hmm. Can you orient your building towards the adjacent property?\nSpeaker 7: You could you a storefront? It depends on what you build. As you know, we've been seeing.\nSpeaker 12: The zoning provisions.\nSpeaker 7: Mandate form, but are several multi-unit next to each other.\nSpeaker 12: But this is the our zone district. So it has a storefront requirement. Is that storefront requirement on an interior side side sideline or is.\nSpeaker 7: It on the primary street, which is Quitman? Yes.\nSpeaker 12: So I'm still trying to because trust me, I've been promoting that we orient these buildings to the right away. Mm hmm. But this is a situation where we're not oriented right away. We're orienting to a slice of property that is clearly owned by RTD.\nSpeaker 12: Mm hmm. And so that's a side interior lot, not a primary street or some other thing. So I'm just trying to grapple with how CPD felt like what was appropriate and I supported for Perry is deemed appropriate for Quitman when they're two completely different street characters classifications.\nSpeaker 7: Again, I think it was the proximity to the transit station that swayed us. Sweet.\nSpeaker 12: So I so we have a new criteria in CPD that says transit station in proximity trumps sort of all or other. No. Okay.\nSpeaker 7: Council them all.\nSpeaker 12: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: But our plan recommendations.\nSpeaker 7: And other our.\nSpeaker 12: Plan recommendations do not say on local streets where we designate where we call for urban, residential, single family and multi-family, that we should be entering into sort of a mixed use zone district. So if we if that is our new idea, we should update our plans to sort of reflect that.\nSpeaker 12: That is the new criteria that overrides our small area plans.\nSpeaker 7: No. When you look at Blueprint Denver, the Land Use Council, that's.\nSpeaker 12: Not a small area plan, though. No, these are small area plans, which I would think.\nSpeaker 7: Both of them are what we look at.\nSpeaker 12: But it doesn't do in our small area plans that are newer and more recently adopted. Trump are sort of prior thinking that predate this.\nSpeaker 7: Well, we have a 2003 plan in Blueprint. We have a 2006 plan in the West Colfax plan. And so I would say generally, we think that the West Colfax plan would trump the blueprint plan. However, I think that with all that's been happening in this neighborhood, staff believes that the West Colfax plan is fairly outdated as well\nSpeaker 12: . Yeah, I wish you've heard me before, because I actually think that you guys are trying to get to the right thing. But I wish we would empower you with more ability to use our waivers and conditions policies to actually shape and work with the developer and the community to slim down.\nSpeaker 7: That in the past. Yeah, it didn't work.\nSpeaker 0: Let's do it again.\nSpeaker 7: We tried that.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, Councilman, can I. Can I get to some other folks and I'll put you down the list?\nSpeaker 12: That's the fine.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you. Councilwoman Black, can I get to Councilman Lopez? Councilor Lopez?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Thank you. Just a couple quick questions. I don't know if this is. For you or for for Laureen. Then I wanted to ask Lorene a question as well. To the property. Behind it was the one that was resolved.\nSpeaker 1: Right? That's if I look. Closely at 1209, Perry. And that was a reason to cheer. Now watch your.\nSpeaker 7: X53rx5.\nSpeaker 1: What's on the other side. So what? What faces this property?\nSpeaker 7: Are you talking about zoning?\nSpeaker 11: Yeah.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. Let me get to a zoning map.\nSpeaker 1: There you are. Is that always a.\nSpeaker 7: Oh, it's a city park.\nSpeaker 1: So it's a park. And the property north to it.\nSpeaker 7: Jim. Jim, you three.\nSpeaker 1: Also faces the park.\nSpeaker 7: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you, Teresa. If I may ask Laurie to come up, please. I just have a couple of questions. Or do you own the property?\nSpeaker 4: Excuse me?\nSpeaker 1: You own the property?\nSpeaker 4: I am an owner of 1275 Tennyson. And I have a contract.\nSpeaker 1: I'm talking about the property of question in question right now. Oh, you're the owner.\nSpeaker 7: Oh, yes. No, we have no.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Remind me what your position was on this. You're a yes. Yeah. You encouraged us to vote yes, right? Yes. In Laureen.\nSpeaker 4: My my position. Hmm.\nSpeaker 1: So you you own part. You don't own property. You don't own that property. You own property in the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 4: I own property four blocks over on Tennyson, the 1200 block of Tennyson.\nSpeaker 1: That where you live?\nSpeaker 4: No, I do not live there. We are we have a townhome under contract on Perry Street, the 1500 block of Perry Street.\nSpeaker 1: Just north of Colfax.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, it's yes, exactly.\nSpeaker 1: So you're by the new development with the slums like area.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 1: You're so. You're. Were you owned properties in the Stones Lake area?\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. I just I wasn't sure many of you actually lived in the neighborhood or own property right there in West Colfax, so.\nSpeaker 4: I own property. I do not live there.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. That counts for right now.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And okay. Councilman. Councilman Black, back up.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. Teresa. Can you tell me what can be built in G three and how tall they can be.\nSpeaker 7: In a moment?\nSpeaker 12: Apartment forms four stories, three stories, up to 45 feet.\nSpeaker 7: So it is a three story. So industry which I wanted to get. What? Here is my old cheat sheet. So urban house in 80 you duplex garden court rowhouse house and apartment and then in the grs5, by contrast, just a shopfront building form.\nSpeaker 7: And as the councilman said, 35 feet is the height limit versus the 70 that we're talking about with the. Or five.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. And, Mr. O'Donnell, your covenant would limit it to 55 feet.\nSpeaker 13: Yes, that's correct. And also for stories.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I know people are asking about the covenant and I think Miss Smith had a concern about it. I will say in my own district, there is a covenant, a piece of property by the South Moor Station that.\nSpeaker 3: The property owner and the neighborhood association agreed upon in 1997. And it's a 50 year agreement and it is attached to the property and there have been multiple property owners and it is still attached to that property, which is why there's nothing there.\nSpeaker 3: So I do know that they they are legally binding, so. All right. That was my only question. Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 7: I've asked my questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Well. Carl's menu. Did you have something else or you didn't care? Bruce, the just want to follow up on the property adjacent there. Do you know what the what they're planning on building there on that property.\nSpeaker 13: On the 1209 Perry? Yes. They're hoping to build for sale condominiums there.\nSpeaker 1: Do you know what the size of that building is going to be? Four stories. For some reason, it would be similar to yours. What you're with there?\nSpeaker 13: That's my understanding, yes.\nSpeaker 1: 55 feet.\nSpeaker 13: I believe it. Four stories is what I've been told. I don't know.\nSpeaker 1: The feed requirement for stories is for the.\nSpeaker 7: We don't have a four stories owned district, so I don't know if.\nSpeaker 1: It is it normally 55 feet.\nSpeaker 7: I a story.\nSpeaker 1: What's five? What's five stories? 73. 73 stories is what?\nSpeaker 7: 40 or 35.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So it's about 55 feet. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Gilmore.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, President Pro tem. I had a question. I believe it would be directed to the city attorney. Some of the residents had mentioned concerns about a shadow that could be created by, I guess, what will be in a covenant four storey building with 55 additional feet.\nSpeaker 5: And and I remember us talking a little bit about, you know, the requirements that that we need to look at to approve or not approve a zoning. And I wanted to make sure, you know, the shadow question. Are we able to consider anything around shadows that a building might create as criteria to not approve a rezoning?\nSpeaker 12: Kels, when Gilmore, Councilwoman Gilmore for this particular zone district. It's going to depend on what the setbacks require. And since we're completely within the Denver zoning code in this area. I don't think it takes into consideration like the protected zone district when you have a transition from old zoning code to the new zoning code.\nSpeaker 12: So I don't think that there's any entitlements to sunlight.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you. Councilwoman Gilmore and Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 12: So quickly, Mr. O'Donnell is the property owner, the sole parcel party on the covenant.\nSpeaker 13: I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch the question.\nSpeaker 12: Is the property owner the sole party on the covenant?\nSpeaker 13: Yes. The the property and or signed in. There's no memo you or agreement or anything with anybody. It was done voluntarily.\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, that's an important thing that I wanted to bring up, simply because when we've done this in the past, it has been with similar to what Councilwoman Black had mentioned, it's a two party covenant where an R.A. or a bid with the owner because you to amend or remove the covenant, you only need the parties that are\nSpeaker 12: involved. And so well it's well intended. The owner could change at any point I mean, remove the mean on record that that covenant at their discretion.\nSpeaker 13: So we approached we can last week in and I attended their board meeting and asked if they would please be a counterparty to an agreement and they'd said no.\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. And so that's what's driving it.\nSpeaker 13: And in the. The those who have expressed concern over five stories are individuals. In in so we we attempted to but we could not identify a counterparty in. So since Denver does not have a four story zone district, we decided the right thing to do in response to this input was to go ahead and record the covenant\nSpeaker 13: on our own.\nSpeaker 12: So let me ask you this, and I don't know if you have owner the owner here, but and maybe Miss missed that one one way we've addressed this in the past I think it was on the on the Saint Dominic's is actually Saint Dominic's was willing to in their covenant or in an M.O., I forget which mechanism\nSpeaker 12: they used but to cover the legal expenses, if the other party, I mean, sort of the other party pursued a judgment on a violation of the covenant. It's pretty easy to count four stories versus more than four stories.\nSpeaker 12: You know, would you guys be willing to do add that language or create that sort of protection if one of the concerned members of the neighborhood would be a party to that covenant?\nSpeaker 13: So because we couldn't find another party, I think we've taken the best and kind of only step we could to memorialize our intent and commitment to only build four stories. And the fact is, is that if anyone were to pull title work even today, this would show up as an exception to title.\nSpeaker 13: And so when this site is up for development and they try to get financing or design, get in step started anything this will appear in and I don't think it can be violated because they won't get financing.\nSpeaker 12: But that would just during your title work you could simply cure that. And but to do that, you'd simply go to the owner and say, look, I need to remove this. There's this covenant because this is preventing me from maximizing my ARX five zoning that I have on the property.\nSpeaker 13: I the, the owner is here tonight and is available to answer questions. I would say that if we've clearly expressed our intent and commitment to this four story issue, and it may be that we could explore a more solid way to to make it bulletproof.\nSpeaker 13: But we've we've done what we could do alone and with the tools available to us that I'm aware of now.\nSpeaker 12: Well, I appreciate that. And I would just encourage any of my colleagues that are supporting this rezoning on the basis of that risk, voluntary restriction that you press the applicant and the owner to sort of a more robust measure.\nSpeaker 12: Do I have any other questions? I don't think.\nSpeaker 2: So. All right. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. This concludes the question portion and closes the public hearing for Council Bill 750. We're now on to comments. Kamal Lopez, this is your district.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. This is the real district three.\nSpeaker 2: Legendary.\nSpeaker 1: House of the legendary. That's right. So I am I want first, I want to thank everybody for for being here and these kind of rezonings often, you know, they're head scratchers, especially when they are along light rail lines and especially when they split neighborhoods right on right across the street is Villa Park with a plan that's 1992\nSpeaker 1: . West Colfax has been behind me, the more nuanced plan, a lot more involvement, and is consistently being tinkered with. So I totally was was very careful not to engage in any of the conversations, any of the meetings, anything like that.\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to be absolutely removed from the process so I can make have with a clear head, take a look at this and then hear from folks in the hearing. And although, you know, I absolutely I absolutely respect and really want to see a lot of the folks who are here.\nSpeaker 1: And thank you for being here. There's a lot of folks who are here. Right. And so we have to really think about this in context in terms of, okay, this is a big neighborhood, big neighborhood to the north and in the south.\nSpeaker 1: You know, for me, I'm thinking of thinking about context. And I think of. How it came in the Council with support from planning board. Yes, there were some no votes and I paid attention to those no no votes, took a look at those, dived into some of the reasoning.\nSpeaker 1: But when you look at the criteria that we have and you look at the criteria that we have in terms of rezoning. This meets the criteria from CPD. It's in compliance with with our plans. It's in compliance with the West Colfax Neighborhood Plan.\nSpeaker 1: And it's not the only development in the neighborhood. Just to the north. You have stones like. And it's growing like crazy. Yes, you do. I'm from the neighborhood. I've been there. A heck of a lot longer than you guys have.\nSpeaker 1: All right. So the second is on Perry. Perry is growing. You see development on Perry happening like nobody's business. I haven't seen any any opposition to that. Right. Third, when you look at 12 or nine, I'm asking why hasn't there why was there opposition to that?\nSpeaker 1: If you're looking at one property on Perry and this is where I disagree with my colleague here, you're looking at the property that faces Perry adjacent to the light rail station. Right. And you look at the property right behind it and the property in question doesn't face anything else but a park.\nSpeaker 1: It's different when you're talking about a neighborhood or units or lots on a neighborhood that face each other. Right. It's absolutely different. It really makes no sense. To restrict height and to restrict density, especially at a light rail station on Perry.\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, we can't consider affordability, but affordability doesn't equate to less units. And so that, you know, what was spoken here earlier in that testimony is kind of out the window. It doesn't make sense. I actually was looking for opposition.\nSpeaker 1: We can did not oppose it that I'm kind of frustrated as well to the organized neighborhood association in the neighborhood isn't isn't present the an issue that Villa Park neighborhood which is right across the street within 200 feet.\nSpeaker 1: They didn't submit any kind of opposition. And then also I don't see the outcry in the room. Where is the outcry? If it was such a big issue, you think this would be filled. And I'm sorry I called you up.\nSpeaker 1: I had. That's that's just the thing. If I see the property owner here who's supporting it. And then I hear testimony from folks that don't even live in that neighborhood. And they live in a neighborhood that's even denser.\nSpeaker 1: So for me. You know, I don't think that there was a necessity for a restriction, but the restriction exists. So that that deed restriction is limited in height for 25 years. As much as I understand it, if this rezoning is approved.\nSpeaker 1: The other thing is this yes the area cost of 20% for for a protest but. What we saw and what we saw in front of us is 16 signatures, 16 signatures, eight of which were valid. To have a real protest to give us the the legal justification to oppose it.\nSpeaker 1: There has to be more than eight signatures. And so and that for me. That's a big deal. I can. It's hard for us to oppose something if the opposition is not in the room. It's big. That's that violates any one of those criteria that we have or that we'd only have a legal protest for.\nSpeaker 1: I've been in this room. When we had rezonings on any matter where we've been here till 3 a.m.. Because it's packed, because there is a legal protest filed over one or two properties. I've been here long enough to know the difference.\nSpeaker 1: And I would I would really encourage that if if there is that activity, if there is that groundswell of folks that don't want to see the density or don't want to see this kind of zoning in the neighborhood around light rail stations, folks.\nSpeaker 1: Then you need to be able to have it in the chambers or in a legal protest. So that. That's where I'm at with this. I you know, I have remained as far away from the intermingling conversations that have had.\nSpeaker 1: Take a look at this objectively. And that's what we do in zoning, is that you have to take a look at this absolutely objective objectively. And I just don't see any reason to oppose it. Any legal reason to oppose it?\nSpeaker 1: And you can laugh and snicker here. But, you know, this is my neighborhood as well, too.\nSpeaker 11: May I speak to why we're snickering?\nSpeaker 1: What is this?\nSpeaker 2: This is. This is the comment period.\nSpeaker 1: Sorry, buddy. You had your.\nSpeaker 2: You had a.\nSpeaker 1: Chance. I had my 3 minutes. But I think it's very.\nSpeaker 11: Interesting that you give developers more time to talk.\nSpeaker 1: But no, no, no, no.\nSpeaker 11: I can. I can. Categorically. Sir, sir, everything that Mr. Lopez just said. Okay. Excuse me for breaking decorum, sir.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. All right. Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Are there?\nSpeaker 11: You can call us.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Are there any other members of council? One of my coming calls for an well.\nSpeaker 12: Is what it is. I just want to explain my vote in that. I'm trying to look back. I'm trying to compare old zoning versus new zoning. I mean, there was a woman, Stephanie Wickman, who lives who signed that protest petition, lives immediately adjacent to this parcel, who will definitely be impacted in a way by this.\nSpeaker 12: The amount of zone lot coverage and the drastic changes in parking versus, you know, anybody who owned in that area prior to 2010. And that's just going to give you three, which is the the culprit of transformation in Jefferson Park that everyone sort of recognizes as like, you know, this is this is this is a foreign thing\nSpeaker 12: . So, Jim, you three is no great shakes. And that's what that's what this area is is is plagued with, in my opinion, in going to this Joan district. This is a good zone district. And philosophically, I'm all for density at our rail stations.\nSpeaker 12: But how we got here isn't how we should get here to density. It is very clear to me that this is a real stretch of old adopted plans in that flies in the face of recent adopted plans and with very, very, very detrimental impact to a local street.\nSpeaker 12: And so, again, philosophically, my heart's in this sort of zone district, but I cannot support it because I don't think it has the valid plan support that it needs in order to for us to sort of grossly say that the criteria has been met.\nSpeaker 12: But I so I just I'm not saying that you guys can't see it, but I don't see it. And I wanted people, Bruce, particularly, because he he knows that I feel that we should have density here. And I work with other developers time and time again, but I try to work in, you know, in a way that\nSpeaker 12: we're actually recognizing the needs of the community, recognizing the needs of developer and trying to find a middle ground. And I think that was what the tool that I've mentioned before is the covenant. That's how we've used it in the past.\nSpeaker 12: I wish we didn't. We can do it through zoning, particularly when we had our and it was a lack of our know strength or willingness or bid. And it's really, really difficult when we don't have the ability to sort of use our tools or use third parties to get to that compromise.\nSpeaker 12: Because I do think there's a compromise to be made here, one that orients a new development towards the towards the Lakewood Gulch, one that satisfies parking and architectural concerns and street lighting concerns, permitting, you know, future residential permits, which you can't do unless he brings a mixed use on that ground floor.\nSpeaker 12: And there's a real way to sort of get to grapple with our station areas in a way that is constructive and not destructive. But our M.O. is to zone to something that is. That is just so. So I don't know.\nSpeaker 12: So. I don't know the loss for words of how pathetic our zoning code is on adapting to the real world contexts of our neighborhoods because they're so applicable citywide that they don't recognize that a Lakewood Gulch and a Jefferson Park are different than an MLK and Central, you know, just completely different animals, but same zoning tool.\nSpeaker 12: And we should be able to sort of reach that compromise. And I and I think Bruce has proven time and time again that he's capable of doing that and willing to do that. But he doesn't have to go any further than where the city takes him or demands and.\nSpeaker 12: And that's really unfortunate. Right. So I've been on that on that on that soapbox for a long time now. Thanks.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Black.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. This is a very interesting rezoning. And as my earlier questioning sort of alluded to, I think. The issues in the neighborhood are really the GMU three rezoning. And I know a lot of the west side of town is is getting some really awful buildings built in residential neighborhoods and and.\nSpeaker 3: That that zone district is is. Is going to hurt your single-family residential neighborhood. And I feel like that's more of a problem than this building that is adjacent to the light rail station. And as we do our work, we really are trying to encourage density at the light rail stations.\nSpeaker 3: To get people to use that the train. And I feel like the adjacent lot that is grx5 makes this appropriate in the fact that nobody came to oppose that. I think it's a legitimate transition to the GM, you three.\nSpeaker 3: Parking is not how we should plan our city. We spend a lot of time talking about parking. You guys can work with. With our parking department on maybe some residential permits. I don't know. But I appreciate the developer considering a covenant.\nSpeaker 3: I think that they would be willing to work with the neighbors on other things. I am going to support it. It does meet the legal criteria that we are required to look at. And so I will be supporting you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman Black.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. I think that the all of the criteria we heard in the staff report would also support the the new generics three. And it does bother me listening to Councilman Espinosa and talking about Equipment Street being a dead end and being completely different from the collector nature of Paris Street that this might be the\nSpeaker 9: even with the restriction in the covenant to force storeys puts significantly more traffic on a dead end street than would occur on that lot that's on Perry. And so I am struggling with that because I think the very same arguments that are made and the criteria that fit the Greeks five also fit the generics.\nSpeaker 9: Three And I know Mr. O'Donnell said that that came along after the application had begun, but I wish that that had been explored more fully, because I think that might be the more appropriate song for this and would be very justifiable.\nSpeaker 9: So thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: Well, actually, I'm sorry, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman can each popped in at that time? She hasn't spoke yet?\nSpeaker 1: No.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 5: I want to thank the folks who spoke today and also a number of you wrote letters and emails. Laurie, I think I got your letters, so I appreciate you communicating with us in advance to share your concerns. I just wanted to speak for a moment about one of the criteria that's been in dispute a little bit, which\nSpeaker 5: is about the adopted plans in terms of the West Colfax plan and its age. I know 26 feels like a long time ago to us, but it is more up to date. That is a more recent plan than we have in many areas of the city.\nSpeaker 5: And I also don't have any reason to believe that we wouldn't come up with similar recommendations because the stuff that went into that plan is so similar to that which is coming out in other plans with other station areas like this.\nSpeaker 5: And so it is it is definitely, in my mind, still a criteria that has been met because I you know, it was still planning for transit. It was still planning for some of the things that the open space was there.\nSpeaker 5: So none of those things that went into that plan have changed. So there's not a lot of belief that I have that the plan would come out necessarily differently. The other thing I wanted to just distinguish, because I know folks are bringing out transportation concerns, is this is a little different than what we talked about a couple\nSpeaker 5: zoning ago. Go with the street and the whole area in that and you have a dead end into an entire development. In this case, you have a dead end into a park. It's not like the development is extending beyond.\nSpeaker 5: And so I think that there's not a lot of purpose, there's no other destination there. So when we when we think about what's going to happen with traffic and a dead end, it's now people are going to the grocery store and then have to get back out again.\nSpeaker 5: The only people who are going to go out, the dead under, the people who are going to be parking there so it doesn't have the same traffic implications as is the earlier one. So. And so, you know, I just you know, I appreciate the concerns and it's always hardest for the folks who live closest in terms of\nSpeaker 5: the impacts of change. And so really sensitive to that. I think there should be a lot of conversation here about step backs on the backside of that building. If it if it doesn't have a protected district element to it.\nSpeaker 5: And owner, I hope that you will be really sensitive in thinking about that. But I to see that the criteria are met and just wanted to speak for a moment about distinguishing why in particular, I think the plan has been met in spite of the fact that folks are concerned about the plan being from 2006.\nSpeaker 5: So with that, I will be supporting it today. But I do hope that you all will stay in dialog and I appreciate your constructive approach tonight. You've been very respectful and communicative and it's very much appreciated. Your your concerns are heard even even if they don't necessarily change the weighing of the legal criteria.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Lopez. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I just I know that the comments have been made on parking, but we can't consider anything when it comes to parking and parking's an issue. Parking from the stadium is becoming an issue all the way that far south.\nSpeaker 1: And we have to consider tags, literally tags that you hang on your car to keep people from parking on your spot. And that's not even your spot. Public Streets, Public Street. But that's a whole nother issue. We can't consider parking as part of a zoning, especially a zoning application space, especially here.\nSpeaker 1: It's just not part of the criteria. And I really, really want to underscore that. And the other point is exactly the brilliance that my calling it was. Just displaying was. That isn't. To other development. It's a dead end, but it's a dead end to a light rail station.\nSpeaker 1: And if we really, really want to be able to increase access and just looking at that, increase access to light rail and stepping down from using vehicles, these are the locations in the way we do it. This is where you have density and it's not fair for folks to live on a light rail station and not even\nSpeaker 1: be able to have access to it or just to limit that access to a few. To a few. What good is a light rail station around bunch of single family homes? With cars. There you have it. So I just want to make that extra point.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. See no other comments. I'll just say this. Number one, everyone who's still here at 9:00, it's an early night for us. But for you, it's a late night. You've come through security, you paid for parking.\nSpeaker 2: And so I just want to thank you for voice, in your opinion, I think is incredibly important. I think this makes our city much, much better. I went on I went on a ride with Councilman Espinosa in his district of Jefferson Park, and I got a chance to see the the development that was happening.\nSpeaker 2: And it is a bit ridiculous and overwhelming for the community. And so we began to have this conversation about what do you what do you do? Where do you what do you kind of go from here? And I have a a proposal coming in my district.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm glad you brought up the the the three story. The the what was I think it was a game, you three that's around here. We have the same issue in a part of five points in San Rafael and the neighbors and they have 80% of the neighborhood on board too downs on the neighborhood because of this\nSpeaker 2: fear. And and although we're talking about this one spot here, I think there's a larger conversation for your entire neighborhood to be had. The thing and Councilman Flynn touched on it that I'm really upset and kind of bothered on is is the Greeks three from CPD.\nSpeaker 2: I don't understand how later in a process that becomes it comes up as a possibility and not in the beginning of the process. And so I wasn't in on those. I I'm sitting here as, you know, an objective, you know, councilperson now.\nSpeaker 2: But. This is the third or fourth time we've had a conversation where this could have been taken care of on the front end between the neighborhood and the community. And now we're dealing with it on the back end.\nSpeaker 2: And so at. I don't I don't get that. And I don't understand that. And it's very frustrating. I. This is a tough one because, you know, obviously, I think the neighborhood has a lot of concerns and they're their right concerns.\nSpeaker 2: And at the same time, we have a criteria. And at the same time, this is a light rail station. And and so this is tough. But I guess my message is twofold. One, I want to have a conversation with CPD on on these enlightenment moments that happen.\nSpeaker 2: As the conversation is going with the proposer and then something changes 6 to 12 weeks down the road. I just I don't get that. You've done this study. Why is it changing? So I just need an explanation on that.\nSpeaker 2: And then to if the neighbors are really wanting to take this to the next level, what does it look like to look at the entire context of the community? So with that, Madam Secretary, Rocco.\nSpeaker 4: Lopez. I knew Ortega.\nSpeaker 7: I.\nSpeaker 3: Black eye.\nSpeaker 4: Clark.\nSpeaker 0: Right.\nSpeaker 4: Espinosa.\nSpeaker 12: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Flynn No.\nSpeaker 4: Gilmore I caution. Can each.\nSpeaker 12: ESPINOZA No.\nSpeaker 4: Mr. President?\nSpeaker 2: No. Please consider bringing us the results.\nSpeaker 4: Sorry. 1/2.\nSpeaker 3: Not everyone's.\nSpeaker 12: Felt sorry.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Can you.\nSpeaker 4: Just.\nSpeaker 2: Change that screen? Eight eyes, three nays. Council Bill 715 passes on Monday, August 28th.

Many evictions are a blow against children who are forced to move away from schools and friends and against the adults who are forced away from community and social support systems.\nSpeaker 3: Every eviction adds to our community's misery and suffering, and it accelerates racist gentrification. This bill would guarantee the right to counsel. That is a right to a lawyer, to any renter in Seattle facing eviction. In other words, if your landlord attempts to evict you, you have the right to a lawyer being with you, defending you in court\nSpeaker 3: , just like people have the right to an attorney if they are accused of a crime. This bill commits the city of Seattle to contract for all the legal representation needed so that eviction defense attorneys can defend every renter without exception facing eviction.\nSpeaker 3: Who needs the help? Before the pandemic, about 1200 renters in Seattle faced eviction every year, even during the pandemic, with the moratorium in place. Landlords have filed more than 300 eviction cases with the court as they are exploiting loopholes in the moratorium.\nSpeaker 3: Many more tenants than can be officially measured on top of that are constantly evicted from their homes when landlords try to evict because tenants are understandably intimidated when they get an eviction notice because they know that the eviction system in Seattle is completely stacked against them and they just move out and undertake greater precariousness in housing in\nSpeaker 3: order to avoid the whole experience of going to court or not going to court and getting evicted. This is especially true for black community members who are given eviction notices at three times the rates for other tenants. Without this right to counsel legislation, we can expect a tsunami of elections once the city and state moratoriums expire as\nSpeaker 3: renters will still be struggling under the double blows of the recession and the global health crisis and will be burdened with debt. And this legislation will not be enough by itself. We will need a lot more. We know that eviction destroys communities, wrecks households, and even kills the 2018 report Losing Home.\nSpeaker 3: The Human Cost of Eviction in Seattle found that 87.5% nearly nine out of ten renters who are evicted end up homeless in their study of 2017 evictions. The authors of the report, the Seattle Women's Commission and the King County Bar Association, found that some tenants even died shortly after being evicted, according to the eviction lab at Princeton\nSpeaker 3: University. Despite the pandemic and the eviction moratoriums, landlords have filed 272,612 evictions since March last year in just 27 cities that the eviction lab has been tracking. Growing evidence, they say, shows that more and more evictions are not driven by so-called mom and pop landlords struggling to balance their personal checkbooks.\nSpeaker 3: Since the CDC eviction moratoriums took effect last September, evictions by corporate landlords have actually been steadily increasing. Research by the Private Equity Stakeholders Project, a research and advocacy organization, has tracked nearly 50,000 evictions by corporate landlords in select counties and six states since the beginning of September last year and found that corporate landlords are responsible for the\nSpeaker 3: majority and sometimes the overwhelming majority of evictions. Seattle is no exception to this. Major corporate landlords are the main actors in our city. The most evicting landlord in 2019 was Goodman Real Estate, a corporation with $2.5 billion. That is billion with a B worth of property holdings in the US and Canada.\nSpeaker 3: Other major victors include regional giant Epic Asset Management and National Landlord Corner Management Corp. The American Civil Liberties Union found that nationally, 90% of landlords are represented in eviction gold, while only 10% of tenants are. Can you imagine, as a struggling tenant facing eviction, perhaps because you just lost your low wage job?\nSpeaker 3: Going up against the likes of attorneys from Goodman real estate. Our right to counsel legislation will give these tenants at least a fighting chance in court when they have to go up against these greedy corporate landlords and their greedy lawyers and the impact on the right to counsel, as we have seen in cities around the country that\nSpeaker 3: have passed similar legislation, is absolutely astounding. With a lawyer, far fewer people are evicted. This is because unjust evictions are overturned in court, and it is because eviction defense attorneys can and do help connect people with social services when they are needed.\nSpeaker 3: The Housing Justice Project in Seattle, for example, works closely with Homebase, which administers rental assistance funds so that they can help people pay their back rent and then present that to a judge to prevent the eviction. Statistically, even for people who are ultimately evicted, having an attorney still improves the outcomes, with renters sites saddled with less crushing\nSpeaker 3: debts. But all of this is not the end of the story. It is also because when there is a universal right to work volunteers to have a trained attorney with them in court, that gives corporate landlords pause from issuing eviction notices in the first place.\nSpeaker 3: In New York, the rate of eviction filings dropped by a stunning 30% since their right to counsel legislation passed. Because landlords now know that they can no longer use the courts to bully renters who have no legal help.\nSpeaker 3: They are going to go up against a trained attorney. These are all the primary reasons to support the right to counsel because of the human impact of evictions on renters and the progressive outcome overall for our society by reducing housing instability and homelessness.\nSpeaker 3: Not to mention the racial component of this giving universal right to counsel is a Black Lives Matter issue. But even through the narrow lens of the city's finances, the right to counsel is sensible. The Housing Justice Project, for example, has estimated that guaranteeing the right to counsel will cost approximately $750,000 in a normal year.\nSpeaker 3: And by a normal year, I mean a year without an eviction moratorium. Compare that to the cost of the courts and the sheriff carrying out an eviction and the cost of homeless services because nine out of ten evicted people become homeless.\nSpeaker 3: It is orders of magnitude more expensive not to pass universal right to counsel. I appreciate the co-sponsorship of councilmembers Lewis and Morales, and I urge all councilmembers to support this legislation without watering it down with one loophole or another loophole.\nSpeaker 3: It is essential to defend the rights of renters in Seattle by offering universal right to counsel for all renters who need legal assistance. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. Silence. Okay, so we are going to go ahead and consider several amendments. My suggestion is that we debate and vote on each amendment before we make comments on the legislation as a whole. If that's acceptable to folks, I'd like to go ahead and proceed in that manner.\nSpeaker 0: And then Councilor Salant as sponsor of the bill, you will have last the last word as is required under the council rules. You'll have the last word on the bill before we close out or in closing out debate.\nSpeaker 0: You'll have the last word on on the bill. So just let us sort of say that out front, as is customary. So let's go ahead and deal with the amendments if that's if that's okay with you councilors want.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm getting ahead. Not so. I'm going to go ahead and go first. Let's go ahead and do them in order of the number of amendments listed on the agenda. So that means the First Amendment is Amendment One, which is being advanced by Council Member Herbold.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Councilmember Herbold to make her motion for consideration and debate of Amendment One.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I move to amend Council Bill 12 007 as presented on Amendment one on the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Is there a second and moved. And thank you so much, Councilor, whereas it's been moved and seconded to amend the bill is presented on Amendment one. Councilmember Herbold, you are recognized in order to address amendment.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you so much. So this amendment would specify that an attorney organization with that the the Department of constructions and inspections would contract with that. That organization should have experience providing legal representation to tenants. This amendment was suggested by an advocate who has deep experience working with tenants in the city of Seattle.\nSpeaker 4: In this individual's experience, they wrote that there are many legal aid organizations that might just provide advice about notices or on the other hand, might only represent tenants in some very narrow circumstances. This bill isn't a funding mechanism, but it is important, I think, that the Council include in our intention that this bill for future funding that\nSpeaker 4: would support this policy be made available only to those organizations willing to represent tenants in a courtroom in the broad circumstances that this this bill contemplates. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, councilmember rebels. Any comments or questions on Amendment one? Councilmember Salom, please.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Herbal This amendment provides clarifying language that is consistent with the intent of the legislation that I will be voting. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you so much. Any other comments or questions on Amendment One? Hearing no additional comments on Amendment one. Will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of Amendment One?\nSpeaker 1: Mosquito I. Petersen. I saw one. Yes. Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Herbold. Yes. Suarez. Yes. Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales. Yes. President Gonzalez. High nine, in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. The motion carries, the amendment is adopted, and the amended bill is now before the council. Councilmember Herbold, I understand you are the sponsor of Amendment two, so I'm going to hand it back over to you to make that motion and to solicit a second and haptic.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I move to amend Council Bill 12 007 as presented on Amendment two on the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Their second.\nSpeaker 2: Second.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Councilmember Peterson. For the second, it's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment two. Councilmember Herbold, back to you to describe the amend.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you so much. This is an amendment regarding future reporting obligations. And as I said this morning in council briefings, meeting the amendment would require that the organization with whom the city contracts will provide reporting on numbers of cases for representation that occurs outside of the initial appearance or show cause hearing.\nSpeaker 4: Most cases, the vast majority of cases are resolved at the initial appearance or show cause hearing. In fact, the last year for which we have data in 2018, only 11 cases of a total of nearly 9000 cases actually went to trial.\nSpeaker 4: But we know that we had some really important and transformational statewide and local eviction law reforms. And it's quite possible, given that those reforms inherently give tenants and largely tenants who are subject to eviction for nonpayment of rent, get them out, give them a basis to to oppose their eviction in court for the first time.\nSpeaker 4: And so it's possible that there have been larger numbers of cases that are actually going to trial rather than being resolved in this initial show. Cause hearing in cases that go to trial are going to take more resources in order in order to continue the the funding of this really important right to counsel policy.\nSpeaker 4: And so this amendment would require that the providers providing the service include this information as report, as required by the contract, and inform the Council in the future about whether further legislative changes need to be made to address any issues that could be brought on by a future increase in the need for representation throughout the period of\nSpeaker 4: a longer trial. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Herbals, are there any additional comments on Amendment two? Seeing and hearing no additional comments on Amendment two. Will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment two?\nSpeaker 1: Mesquita. I. Peterson.\nSpeaker 2: All right.\nSpeaker 1: So what?\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Herbold Yes. Suarez Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Lewis Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales Yes. President Gonzalez. High nine, in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. The motion carries, the amendment is adopted, and the bill has now includes Amendment two as well. So I'm going to go ahead and move now to Amendment three, which is my amendment. Which is my amendment. I move to amend the Council Bill 1 to 0 007 as presented on Amendment three on the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Is there a second? Second. Thank you so much. It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment three. I will, as sponsor of the amendment, address it and then we will open the floor for additional comments and discussion of the amendment.\nSpeaker 0: Colleagues, as I mentioned this morning during council briefing, I was interested in pursuing a amendment that accomplished two things one that made the bill legally defensible and a more workable bill that would actually bring to fruition the right to counsel to those tenants who need it the most.\nSpeaker 0: And secondarily, I have a strong interest in supporting this policy and ensuring access to legal aid for those tenants who who need it the most. And so my office pursued this particular amendment, which accomplishes a few simple things.\nSpeaker 0: So first of all, this bill adds a recital to acknowledge that the council's intent to minimize that the council has an intent to minimize as many barriers as possible to accessing counsel for those who need it. Second Amendment three establishes that any tenant residing in Seattle has the right to legal counsel free of charge if the tenant\nSpeaker 0: meets a simple indigency standard. This indigency standard is modeled on the same standard utilized in the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund, which was unanimously adopted by the City Council in 2006. The definition of indigency focuses on the inability to afford an attorney at any point during an unlawful detainer lawsuit.\nSpeaker 0: Third, this amendment allows the contracted legal service providers to establish the process and manner by which to verify indigency. This is a common practice that is similar to the steps taken by service providers in other circumstances, such as the self-certification process that was approved in the COVID 19 eviction defense bill last year.\nSpeaker 0: In that example, the tenant simply needs to sign a form at their appearance in eviction court. That could be as simple as saying, I cannot afford an attorney and then signing that form and being therefore immediately eligible for receiving free legal aid.\nSpeaker 0: So we are not talking about a process by which by which a tenant is going to have to present a mountain full of paperwork in order to prove that they're indigent. It is as simple as the process that we currently have in place for the Legal Defense Fund, which is a self attestation or certification that you indeed\nSpeaker 0: cannot pay for your own attorney in this unlawful detainer action. I believe this is very simple. I believe that most individuals who need the access to legal aid are going to be able to easily simply and in collaboration with legal service providers who have a strong interest in providing legal services to those individuals is going to be\nSpeaker 0: able to accomplish the council's underlying policy goals here of making sure that we have access to legal aid for those who need it the most. So again, I believe that this language is is going to minimize the risks of having this law survive a legal challenge, which, again, I believe is almost going to certainly happen while also\nSpeaker 0: providing access to a right to counsel to those that need it. This amendment, again, as a reminder, is modeled after the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund that the city council unanimously passed in 2016. In that case, we also included an indigent standard.\nSpeaker 0: And again, in the three years of existence, the deportation defense fund has helped hundreds of immigrants and refugees fighting deportation proceedings while have. No administrative burden or chilling effect on those seeking services as a result of the indigence standard and the self-certification process.\nSpeaker 0: In that context, again, this was unanimously supported by the City Council at the time in the Legal Defense Fund. So I would today ask for your support in voting in favor of Amendment three. All right. We have some comments here.\nSpeaker 0: So we're going to open up the floor. First up is Councilmember Herbold, followed by Councilmember Morales. Because my hurdle.\nSpeaker 4: You're not.\nSpeaker 0: Actually.\nSpeaker 5: Ready to.\nSpeaker 4: Go that win. All right. Well, thank you, Counsel President Gonzales, for bringing forward this amendment to make this bill stronger. This amendment is not an example of means testing. Legal services providers can simply ask renters to sign a statement that they are eligible for this service, and after doing so, they are immediately entitled to representation.\nSpeaker 4: There is no test for anyone to have to produce documents and wait for the test to be graded. It is not means testing. Means testing is a method for determining whether someone qualifies for financial assistance to obtain a service or good.\nSpeaker 4: And it looks at the means or monetary resources that that individual has available to them to pay for a particular service or good. Then it determines that the person's access to financial assistance is based on their ability to pay for it.\nSpeaker 4: Again, this amendment does not require means testing. This amendment will make the right for stronger, for eligible renters stronger to resist legal challenge from those who do not want anyone to have the right. Just one person receiving a free attorney when they have sufficient funds to pay for an attorney could bring the hard earned right to counsel\nSpeaker 4: law down. I do not want to take that risk. This amendment ensures that the greatest number and those most in need are eligible to receive assistance when facing eviction with the most minimal of requirements. I've seen data that means testing can be a barrier to services.\nSpeaker 4: I have not seen any data that a self attestation of poverty is a barrier to services. No one is caving to big landlords or creating loopholes to reduce the number of people who have access to the right to counsel that this policy serves.\nSpeaker 4: Nor are we watering anything down. We are trying to pass a bill to ensure that tenants can remain housed when they are unaware of their rights or don't have the resources to stand up for their rights. And that's why it's so important that we ensure that this legislation can stand up to legal challenges.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. Councilmember Morales is next and then Councilmember Salaam.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I don't have much more to add than what Councilmember Herbert just said. It is basically the case that right now legal service providers already ask a simple question about one's.\nSpeaker 3: Ability to pay.\nSpeaker 4: And this amendment doesn't add requirements for detailed income information. It is simply codifying what is actually happening in practice and leaves to the providers decisions about how to set parameters for how to determine that. So I don't think that it creates any additional barrier.\nSpeaker 4: It just clarify some of the things that are already happening, and I intend to.\nSpeaker 2: Support this amendment. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Customer. Customers.\nSpeaker 3: I opposed this amendment to insert means testing or any other kind of requirement for people to have to qualify for the right to counsel. I believe the right to counsel should be universally available for those who need it.\nSpeaker 3: Just because it has been a standard used in a previous legislation is not a good enough reason to reproduce it in this legislation. Council members may not want to call it means testing. You can call it happy joy testing if you want, but it is still means testing.\nSpeaker 3: In reality, it is asking people to go through us as a, you know, some kind of hoop jump through some kind of hoop before they qualify. People should be able to have universal rights. I also do not agree with the idea that this amendment makes the legislation, quote unquote, legally defensible.\nSpeaker 3: Eviction. Defense attorneys themselves have made it very clear that such amendments are not needed to make this legislation legally defensible. At the end of the day, what makes any law passed strong progressive law passed strong against legal challenges by corporations, by the wealthy, by corporate landlords, is a fighting united movement of working people, renters and everyone who\nSpeaker 3: wants to have and live in an affordable and just city. The right to have a lawyer to prevent eviction should be available for every renter facing eviction. Just like all the best public services. There is no means test to use the public roads.\nSpeaker 3: They are available for everyone. There is no means test for public education or for the fire department. There is no means test to use the lights on the street lights federally. Social Security is available to everyone, rich and poor.\nSpeaker 3: And because of that, it has endured for 86 years, almost a century, despite repeated attempts to dismantle it by the ruling class. Both Republican and Democratic administrations. And because these crucial public services are not means tested, nobody is shamed or humiliated for using them across the spectrum of social services.\nSpeaker 3: Any means testing, even the least invasive aspects or types, has the effect of preventing some of the most vulnerable people from using the service. Let's be clear. The reason this means testing amendments from city council Democrats is not as bad or invasive or onerous as it could have been is because the renters rights and socialist activist movement\nSpeaker 3: who organized to win this legislation said loudly that we oppose means testing and we waste our position in a unified manner which made our collective voice so powerful. Order to say thank you to Seattle Tenants Union Socialist Alternative, the ACLU, The Housing Justice Project, Real Change, Transit Riders Union and many others for speaking out against any kind\nSpeaker 3: of means testing. We saw that organizing in public comment today, which has made it very clear the harm that means testing can do and is exposed to the light of day attempts by Democrats to bring far worse amendments.\nSpeaker 3: However, even when the process of applying is not onerous, people are hesitant about using any kind of means tested services because they feel humiliated or they're not sure they are eligible, or they have missed assumptions about how difficult the application will be.\nSpeaker 3: The Reality of Eviction. Gordon in town in King County, as 13 organizations have pointed out in their letter, shows that the eviction process in Washington makes the use of any kind of test unworkable. Unlike criminal proceedings, this is designed to be very quick and occur in as little as three weeks from the time it misses a rental\nSpeaker 3: payment. Unlike a criminal proceeding, which is much longer and involves multiple court dates, most have only one court date for that one court date. We should not, as a legislature, be putting any barriers, however less onerous. However, less invasive means testing has always been used politically by pro-business politicians, both Republican and Democrat, for over 40 years to\nSpeaker 3: divide and conquer and make it easy to dismantle the programs, or at least gut them in the future. One reason why Democratic former President Bill Clinton was able to destroy wealth vote in 1996 was because when it was set up in the first place, decades before then, it was set up with means testing in the first place\nSpeaker 3: . Throughout the existence of these means tested programs, there have been wildly false rumors about people abusing them. These complete fabrications were used by Clinton, along with legislators of both political parties to guard the welfare programs. The most important reason to reject this means testing amendment is because of the missed opportunity to set a better precedent that has\nSpeaker 3: been set in the past. Council President Gonzalez referred to other means tested services in Seattle and the state. And we've seen this before, but we've heard this before. But the city council is populated by self-described progressive Democrats. There is one socialist rather than Seattle, watering down local renter protections to match the concessions that are being made elsewhere\nSpeaker 3: or were made in the past. My question is why aren't progressive Democrats supporting the legislation without any watering down, without any means testing? However, less invasive it may be, and then use that precedent to demand that legislators in Olympia, for example, follow through and pass a strong law.\nSpeaker 3: Finally, I want to also emphasize that all these allusions to legal concerns are not acceptable, because, as I said and I wanted to reiterate, renters rights attorneys themselves have roundly rejected it. Renters rights attorneys want a bill that stands up in court.\nSpeaker 3: They are not in the business of wanting the legislature, like the city council, to pass laws that won't stand up in court. They absolutely want a bill to stand up in court. It is not in their interest to create any legal vulnerabilities and they are strongly supported this legislation without any watering down the idea that means testing\nSpeaker 3: is necessary is an idea that is only ever foisted on the most vulnerable people in our society. Over the past couple of weeks, we have heard from community members many examples of programs to give handouts to the rich and powerful that have no means testing whatsoever.\nSpeaker 3: Whether onerous or not, there is none. There was no means test required for the Seattle Mariners to prove they needed financial support for their stadium. There was no means test for landlords to get compensation from the city through other legislation.\nSpeaker 3: There was no means test when the city paid tens of millions to the wealthy waterfront businesses to compensate the interruption of their sidewalk access during the seawall construction. There was no means test when the city invested almost half a billion rebuilding the streets around Mercer to accommodate Amazon's campus.\nSpeaker 3: There was no means testing when Washington State gave Boeing executives and major shareholders a $9 billion corporate tax handout in 2013. There is no means test for elected officials in Seattle to pay themselves exorbitant six six digit salaries.\nSpeaker 3: Means testing is not needed in this legislation because people in election code are already at the absolute end of their resources. If they had any money for attorneys. They would have paid their rent in the first place and not got.\nSpeaker 3: Eviction notices. Means testing is not legally necessary. Means testing can do real harm by creating obstacles for people in desperate need for help. And it opens the door to further weakening of the legislation in the future. And we have the opportunity to set a strong precedent against this today.\nSpeaker 3: So I urge council members to vote no on this amendment.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. So once again. Next up is Councilmember Suarez and then Councilmember Tina Awards.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you very much. I want to, first of all, thank Councilman Harold and President Gonzalez for their comments. You've been hearing me say some of this since March 4th. So this ordinance, as originally written without eligibility criteria, is arguably a gift of public funds and therefore violates state law.\nSpeaker 4: So in order to remedy this legal flaw and this vulnerability, because we already know that preventing homelessness is a fundamental governmental purpose, which we all agree on today. We have eligibility criteria where someone can self attest that they are in fact indeed indigent, indigent, indigenous.\nSpeaker 4: So what we do is we looked at other programs where we have a right to counsel in the civil arena, not the criminal arena. And we looked at the Northwest Justice Project and the Tenant Law Center and Council President as she shared proposal, which we all voted on in 2016, the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund, which was passed\nSpeaker 4: the simple. Eligibility requirement. I'm kind of tired of going back and forth about means testing and eligibility, but I will state this just for the record. Everything customers want said about means testing is true. But that's not what we have in front of us.\nSpeaker 4: Means testing is a requirement that applicants for any type of government public assistance submit to an investigation of their funds and resources that they actually have to provide documentation to show that they're indigent. The means test originated as a method of limiting.\nSpeaker 5: Payment of public.\nSpeaker 4: Assistance to those truly in need in order to reduce the cost of such programs to taxpayers. Means testing was used as to limit payment of public assistance to those truly in need. More often than not, it is weaponized.\nSpeaker 4: As a former public defender and as a former person at Evergreen Legal Services that represented people in court for unlawful detainer, that is what we looked at. We did not have means testing. We made sure that you had legal counsel for unlawful detainer and for the issues that were in front of us today, the eligibility criteria.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Council president which she brought forward talks about are actually is very succinct and it addresses the issue of what anyone may qualify for by simply saying that they're indigent. They choose that they want to participate. And by choosing that they want to participate, they show that they're in fact.\nSpeaker 4: And then in saying that poor. So the eligibility criteria allows and permits government to provide a benefit that promotes the public good and determines that such criteria, such as indigency, is why we would move forward to make sure and I want to make another point that I agree with, Councilmember Rubio had raised my main concern about allowing\nSpeaker 4: everybody, anybody like the Oprah show to have a lawyer all the time, every time. Is that then those truly in need that don't have money, that are truly indigent are not going to get legal counsel because there's only so much money.\nSpeaker 4: And the last three years we have put in the budget and we have all passed which council like has always voted no on, I'd say almost to the tune of $1,000,000 in the last three years. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nSpeaker 4: For people to have legal counsel during eviction, when we have put forward money in the budget to ensure that there's money there for people who are being wrongfully evicted, have legal counsel. So what I'm trying to say is that we are moving forward on an important piece of legislation that is going to be permanent in which people\nSpeaker 4: must just say that they are indeed in need of legal assistance and they can choose to participate in the program. You know, it's just kind of disheartening that sometimes when you just try to do good things, I don't think I'm in the back pocket of slumlords or big corporations.\nSpeaker 4: I still don't know what a progressive Democrat is to some degree. I'm not against the homelessness. I'm certainly not against the poor. As a former public defender as well and as a attorney for 35 years, I can say this is pretty straightforward.\nSpeaker 4: And what we're just trying to do a good thing.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you.\nSpeaker 2: I'll leave it at that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Consumer Awareness Council Member Mosquito. Thank you very much. Council President I just want to thank councilmembers a lot for bringing this forward. This is the first time I've had a chance to sort of talk about this legislation.\nSpeaker 0: Was looking forward to voting on it a few weeks ago, and I'm glad that this is moving forward today. So thank you for bringing this forward. I know cities across the country are also looking to do similar things, so I appreciate the work that's gone into this legislation.\nSpeaker 0: I think the outrage that has been expressed about means testing is absolutely right. I think the ire that we all feel that I've expressed before when we talked about this legislation about means testing and income testing is 100% accurate.\nSpeaker 0: And I have spent a long time fighting against means testing in the state legislature, especially when I worked to implement Apple Health, especially Apple health for kids about a dozen years ago. At that point means testing, as Councilmember Morales just said, was being weaponized to try to prevent immigrant kiddos from being added to the rolls for eligibility\nSpeaker 0: for Apple health at the time. And that is why I have and continue to fight against means testing. I think that it's important to me to have understood the discussion today and that the briefing from the Council President on this amendment in the context of the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund ordinance that it was based off of.\nSpeaker 0: As I understand, this amendment in front of us, the legal organizational well except self attestation simply saying an individual can simply say they don't have the means to form an attorney. I know a lot of folks who are struggling right now, working month to month, many people out of work or, you know, still trying to pay their\nSpeaker 0: own rent and childcare and the concept of having to pay an attorney. On top of that, a lot of people are going to say that they can't afford an attorney. So basically someone self-testing that they can't afford an attorney meets the criteria here that the organization, the Legal Assistance Organization, is not going to ask for income verification\nSpeaker 0: . I'm not going to look at any monetary resources. And as I think Councilmember Herbold said, not comply with a test of any kind. So I think that this is a big distinction from the types of means testing that I have fought in the past.\nSpeaker 0: Self attestation is what we've actually fought for and many cases as an alternative to means testing so that people can get the services that they're eligible for. And in this case and this case that we determined a right to appreciate that there is clarification that there's no documentation required at the time of application or later.\nSpeaker 0: And as I checked in with a handful of legal assistance folks across the city who are currently helping and have previously helped, they noted that this is really important because it's been a long standing approval process by including federal entities like the Legal Services Corporation to avoid undermining attorney client privilege and that relationship.\nSpeaker 4: To.\nSpeaker 0: Make sure that they just accept from the client at the point of service that they are not able to pay for an attorney, that any additional type of barrier would be a barrier to the intake and could not be a functional process.\nSpeaker 0: So they are very much opposed to means testing but have been working under this existing model of self attestation and believe that it is the you know, that this is not an additional barrier. I understand that the standard is not a test now or an application later, and that's a very important clarification that I wanted to put\nSpeaker 0: out there because just like I think means testing can have a chilling effect on whether or not someone applies for services. I also don't want there to be any confusion out there when this bill passes the knock on way.\nSpeaker 0: When this bill passes, I don't want there to be any confusion out there about folks coming and signing up. There is no test. At the very least, it sounds like there's going to be a piece of paper that sign, and we want to make sure folks get access to those services.\nSpeaker 0: And I don't want there to be a chilling effect from any debate we can debate. But ultimately, this legislation is going to pass and I look forward to supporting the final legislation. And we'll be supporting this amendment to the.\nSpeaker 0: And you can smear a mosquito. Are there any other comments on Amendment three, Councilor Lewis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Madam President, I couldn't figure out how to do the little digital raise hand today for some reason, so I did it the old fashioned way. So thank you for recognizing to me here for a moment. I will be supporting your amendment today.\nSpeaker 2: My colleagues have already made a lot of the comments that I would have, but I do want to emphasize a few more that I think are instructive and important. I do want to add that another distinction between the self attestation and means testing is that this will not incur procedural costs since we are not doing financial screenings\nSpeaker 2: and investigations into people's financial background to do a self attestation, which I think is a critical thing to note, that means testing. And one of the big arguments, in addition to what we've already discussed here today on the the the impact it can have on people seeking services, the deterrence effect you can have on people seeking services\nSpeaker 2: it also incurred would have incurred real cost to the city in buying the software for half million dollars, hiring an FTE at a cost of over $100,000. Our model of self attestation does not do that and also can kick in procedurally at the point when people will need this legal assistance and will not require a delay or\nSpeaker 2: a rescheduling of these Tenet related eviction proceedings. So it doesn't come with those logistical and financial costs. That means testing would have come with in addition to all the other horrible things about means testing that we have already discussed extensively in this session.\nSpeaker 2: I do also just want to acknowledge that my appreciation for the Council, President Gonzales, and bringing forward a proposal that is structured to to provide the very minimum of potential hurdle while addressing the very real substantive impacts. I don't want to violate the fight fight club rules of executive session, but I will just say all of us\nSpeaker 2: were in that executive session. You know, I think that it is important that we center the guidance and advice of the team that successfully defeated vigorous legal actions against just cause eviction, against first in time protections, against the various eviction moratoriums this council has enacted.\nSpeaker 2: And I believe that it was. I appreciate Council President's diligence in working with that team, working with us on the council to craft something that will still provide this vital service to everyone who will need it, while at the same time strengthening this law against the challenges that we know will come from deep pocketed and very well-resourced\nSpeaker 2: landlord interests that will sue to try to get rid of it. So with that, Madam President, I don't have any additional comments, and I appreciate your leadership in bringing this forward as well as the comments of my colleagues similarly speaking to this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilor Lewis. Are there any additional comments on Amendment three? Okay. Councilmember Salant.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I just wanted to specifically address the question of self attestation. I do not agree that self attestation will not be a barrier because that's not what the data indicates at all. For example, according to Seattle City Light, the official enrollment number for the utility discount program, which is for low income people who cannot afford to\nSpeaker 3: pay their full utility bills as of the enrollment numbers as of the end of February is 42,094 and customers and they are currently estimating the department is currently estimating the number of eligible households that 90,000. So that means that Seattle's utility discount program has enrolled less than 50% of the estimated eligible households.\nSpeaker 3: It used to be even worse than that. It used to be under 20% when I first took office and became the chair of the Energy Committee, and we fought to improve it. And the city now, although endorse people who live in Seattle Housing Authority and other low income housing, this was part of our effort from our movement\nSpeaker 3: to make it an opt out and rather an opt in program. But that was not enough. Also, now the application process has been made simpler, which, of course, I support any, you know, making any obstacles simpler. But now there's a simple self-certification so that people can self-certify their income.\nSpeaker 3: But still, the enrollment remains at less than 50% years later. And there are many other examples. But I chose this one because it is close to ours. You know, it's right here in the city of Seattle. And so when the evidence does not show that the station will not be a barrier, I don't know how councilmembers can\nSpeaker 3: claim that it won't be a barrier because it will. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Hey, are there any additional comments or questions on Amendment three otherwise? Because I'm the sponsor, I get the last word on it. So just last call on Amendment three. Okay. I'm going to make some closing remarks here. I do want to thank you all for the conversation and the debate around Amendment three and your consideration of adopting\nSpeaker 0: Amendment three. There's a few things I want to clarify in response to some of Councilmember Silence comments on Amendment three that I do think are are not entirely accurate. One, I do not believe that lawyers representing tenants are going to humiliate tenants as a result of the passage of Amendment three.\nSpeaker 0: There were some comments made that somehow a sales attestation was going to result in humiliation. But let's remember that the people who are asking the questions about eligibility and about accessing legal services are the very the very people we're relying to represent those individuals.\nSpeaker 0: And I believe that they are going to put forward, consistent with their current processes, something that is compassionate, that is not embarrassing, and that will fulfill their mission of making sure that as many tenants as possible have access to free legal services when needed during eviction proceedings.\nSpeaker 0: Second, there has been a there has been a creation of comparisons between access to water, light and roadways, to legal aid services that pay for a lawyer. And I believe this is a false equivalency and should be rejected for that reason.\nSpeaker 0: Third, this is not a means test. We have a constitutional obligation to not engage in the gift of public funds. This applies to every single action and determination and decision we make as a city council. That obligation flows again from the Washington State Constitution.\nSpeaker 0: I believe that Amendment three focuses our limited resources on those who most need access to free legal services and eviction proceedings. And I believe that even with the inclusion of Amendment three, those individuals who need representation for free in eviction proceedings will in fact be able to receive those services.\nSpeaker 0: Fourth, there's been a lot of remarks by Councilmember Salant about this setting a precedent that would not otherwise be set if we pass the base bill without Amendment three. However, only an amendment to the Washington to the Washington states Constitution would allow for the state legislature to avoid the realities of the duties related to the gift of\nSpeaker 0: public funds. In other words, this obligation related to public to avoiding the gift of public funds applies equally to the Washington state legislature, as it does to us. There is no such effort at the state to amend the Constitution to allow for a different standard related to how we allocate and appropriate taxpayer dollars at the local, regional\nSpeaker 0: or state effort. That is exactly why Senate Bill 5160, which is specifically designed to address the eviction cliff that we are all facing, includes an emergency requirement to create a statewide right to counsel. And lastly, fifth, there has been an analogy created between the indigency standard that we're about to consider adopting an Amendment three to the provisions\nSpeaker 0: provided for in the utility discount program, a simple Google of utility discount program. Seattle request enrollment brings up the enrollment form that an individual would have to fill out in order to determine whether or not they're eligible. Unlike the UDP program, my amendment does not, for example, include the disclosure of what is the expected or estimated monthly\nSpeaker 0: income for your household before taxes. In fact, if you look at the UDP eligibility enrollment form, there is a question that requires disclosure of the expected or estimated monthly income for your household before taxes. That requirement is not included in Amendment three, only a self attestation that you cannot afford.\nSpeaker 0: An attorney will be asked in order to determine legal eligibility under this particular program. So, again, I think that there is there is not a clean comparison between the UDP. The UDP certainly requires much more than a self-certification and attestation of not being able to afford, for example, in that case, paying your bill.\nSpeaker 0: So I will close out debate there and appreciate again y'all's consideration of adopting Amendment three and am excited about voting on this bill to finally, once and for all, create a right to counsel for tenants in the city of Seattle and look forward to doing that, doing that very soon here.\nSpeaker 0: So without. Further ado, while the piece called a role on the adoption of Amendment three.\nSpeaker 1: Macheda I Pietersen.\nSpeaker 2: II.\nSpeaker 1: So what?\nSpeaker 3: No.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: HERBOLD. Yes. Suarez, I.\nSpeaker 2: Lewis Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales Yes. President Gonzalez. I. Eight in favor one opposed.\nSpeaker 0: The motion carries, the amendment is adopted, and the amended bill is now before the council. Councilmember Peterson, I'm going to hand it over to you to make your motion for, I believe, it's Amendment four.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President I move to amend Council Bill 1 to 0 007 as presented as Amendment four on today's agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Saddam is there. Okay. There's been a it's been moved and seconded. Thank you, Councilmember Juarez. It's been seconded to amend. The bill is presented on Amendment four. Councilmember Peters, I'm going to hand it back over to you to walk us through your remit.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President. I'll be brief. This amendment number four on today's agenda, as I mentioned in council briefing, would advise one of the recitals in the bill to clarify that the executive department should conduct an open request for proposals process for awarding these tax dollars rather than making a direct award to a single attorney organization without\nSpeaker 2: an open process. This amendment will provide a grace period of a year and a half to continue with the existing contract and the request for proposals. Process would occur and that comports with best practices in awarding ongoing contracts to provide additional opportunities to attorney organizations, which could include the existing one as well as others that would like\nSpeaker 2: consideration for providing these important legal services. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much, Casmir Peterson. Any comments or questions on Amendment four? Councilmember Mosqueda, please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilmember Peterson. I always try to make sure that no one is surprised by my votes. And so I want to give a chance to let other folks know.\nSpeaker 0: I did have a chance to check in on Cosmo Peterson. And I apologize that I didn't ask some of the questions during morning briefing this morning. I am not in favor of this amendment simply because I think it might be more in the weeds than necessary for us.\nSpeaker 0: See, I think that while it's advisory, they certainly can take it under advisement, but it's not directing them. I feel like it is not necessary, given what I understand is that they go through a process for their hour of peace on a fairly regular basis.\nSpeaker 0: And I also think that there's a level of urgency around the relation, the trust relation that hopefully a contracting entity would have with referral entities or with folks who work with those who might need services. So I appreciate where you're coming from with this, because I do think it's important for those court contracts to go out.\nSpeaker 0: But I understand that CCI already has something similar in the works, and I'm going to be voting no on this today. But I appreciate the intent from where you came from. It seems they were silent.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I will be voting no on this amendment. As was explained, it is just an amendment to whereas clause does not change the substance of the legislation. However, I am voting no because it is overly prescriptive of how the department, the Department of Construction Inspections contracts out these services and does not reflect the reality of eviction\nSpeaker 3: . In the bill that my office has proposed, the base bill, it says that the Seattle Department of Construction Inspection, or as DCI, which is the city department responsible for enforcing renters rights, is responsible for contracting with an organization to defend renters facing eviction.\nSpeaker 3: Our bill then gives parameters for what makes an organization a good choice to provide these services. We want attorneys with experience defending renters in court against eviction. We want an organization that works out of the King County Courthouse so that renters in eviction court can be met by an attorney when they show up.\nSpeaker 3: The reality is there is the the the the Housing Justice Project is the only organization like that right now in Seattle. And as they will themselves tell you, there aren't many private firms or any at all, perhaps, and very few around the country that provide this kind of service, which is defending renters against eviction.\nSpeaker 3: The Housing Justice Project attorneys are dedicated, and they do their best they can to support renters. That is why the various laws we propose states that as DCA should continue contracting with OJP unless another organization becomes better qualified.\nSpeaker 3: The legislation currently includes that language unless another organization becomes better qualified. We recognize that we do not know who will be defending Rangers in ten years. 20 years, maybe it will be. Maybe it will be some organization that doesn't exist.\nSpeaker 3: Right now, the department is empowered by the legislation to make that decision. We do not require that the department contractors be, but we do acknowledge the role that they are playing right now. Whether as ECI uses an RFP or an IQ are few or renews existing contracts.\nSpeaker 3: None of this needs to be prescribed in the legislation. I do want to stress again that because this amendment changes only awareness clause, it does not change any functional part of the legislation. However, I do think it's unnecessary and overly.\nSpeaker 2: Prescriptive, so I would be, you know.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Herbold.\nSpeaker 4: You know, so I think the language in the existing recital about a future organization potentially becoming better qualified, that that determination could be made by an RFP. I don't know what other way a department would have to make that determination if it was not for an open, competitive process to determine who is most qualified.\nSpeaker 4: Given that this is only a recital, it's only providing the council's policy preference. I mean, given that it's important to Councilmember Peterson and given that, I would hope that with this amendment, we could get his support for for the bill.\nSpeaker 4: And I think that's important that the council speak with unanimity when there is unanimity and when there's disagreement about small recitals. I would say that let's let's let's not focus on where our differences are. Let's try to focus on where, where, where we have agreement.\nSpeaker 4: And I for all those reasons, I would definitely support the recital as proposed. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, any other comments on Amendment four? Okay. I'm going to hand it back to Councilmember Peterson in a minute. But I do want to signal that I intend to support this amendment as well. For many of the reasons stated by Councilmember Herbold, I don't think it creates a different rubric.\nSpeaker 0: It's a recital. It's not part of the law. I appreciate the intent with which it's brought forward, and I intend to support it for that reason. So. Peterson Anything else to add?\nSpeaker 2: No, thank you. I appreciate the ability to bring this forward and further down the road. Robust discussion.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. All right. We're closing out debates now that the sponsor of the amendment has had the last word. So will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment four MACHEDA?\nSpeaker 1: No. Paterson.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Sir. What?\nSpeaker 3: No.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: HERBOLD Yes.\nSpeaker 1: SUAREZ Yep.\nSpeaker 2: LEWIS Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales No. President Gonzalez, I. Six in favor, three opposed.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. The motion carries, the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the council. Okay, folks, that exhausts our amendments as we know them. And now we have a bill is in front of us and is amended again as a result.\nSpeaker 0: We'll have the last word on the bill as the prime sponsor of the bill. But I am asking for folks who might want to speak on the bill now. PETERSON Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President. I want to I want to thank the council president for her leadership on this, to help us to give us more time and to her substantive amendment that passed today to enact laws strong enough to survive scrutiny so that we can actually help our most vulnerable neighbors.\nSpeaker 2: Policymakers sometimes need the time to think through the various ramifications. And because we took the time in this case, we were able to consider and approve sensible amendments to make this legislation better. So I am able to update my vote to a yes.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Councilmember Morales.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, thank you. Sorry. Technology. Thanks, colleagues. I just want to reiterate, I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of this legislation to bring all tenants representation and eviction cases and really appreciate today's discussion. It's true that any renter can face eviction and a tenant should know that they have support during one of the hardest times in their life\nSpeaker 4: . And that support shouldn't be contingent on a public health emergency or any other limitations. We know that prior to the pandemic, tenants were already facing tough odds in eviction court if they didn't have legal representation. And as eviction moratorium are lifted across the region and the public emergency is in our rearview mirror, we know that many of\nSpeaker 4: our neighbors will be in tough situations again. So at the moment, those lucky enough to know about programs like the Housing Justice Project or the Tenant Law Center know that legal representation can be the difference between remaining housed and creating a plan to have to live in your car.\nSpeaker 4: And folks shouldn't have to feel lucky to access limited, free legal representation. So as I said before, the landlord tenant relationship is unbalanced and the right to counsel goes a long way toward providing tenants with some protection and putting them on equal footing with landlords.\nSpeaker 4: And I'm proud to sponsor this legislation. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Morales. Are there any other comments? Councilman Moschino, please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilmember Peterson, again for bringing forward your amendment. I am very happy to hear your comments as well. And along with what Councilmember Herbold said, always do want to strive for where we can highlight the unanimous unanimity and the collaborative work\nSpeaker 0: on council. And I am very excited to be able to support this legislation today, including with the amendments that were passed today. I think that it puts us on more solid legal ground. I think that there's a tremendous amount to celebrate as Seattle, again, is going to be looked at as a national leader in this issue.\nSpeaker 0: I was trying to look up the statistic just to remind myself, but on this morning's news, I believe it's on Democracy Now! I heard that around 20% of renters are still struggling to be able to pay rent. And the cliff for when those eviction moratoriums go away is very real and threatening.\nSpeaker 0: We are working very hard to make sure that renters have dollars in hand. And I want to reiterate rental assistance bill that we're considering next week is also a small landlord assistance bill. Right, because it passes through and it's part of that support network that goes to our smallest landlords who are also being impacted by the consequences\nSpeaker 0: of COVID. So I see it as a both and conversation. Today's bill is truly something to be celebrated and for us to continue to reiterate to people that if you are facing eviction, you now have a right to counsel.\nSpeaker 0: And we can say that with incredible pride in the city of Seattle. Thank you all for all of your amendments that you brought forward today to make this legislation stronger. And thanks to customers a lot, and Morales and Lewis, who are the original co-sponsors as well, this legislation.\nSpeaker 0: I am looking forward to passing it and to showing that unanimity unanimously across council for our united support. And to do that not just for renters who are facing eviction, but truly to provide a more stable local economy as we recover.\nSpeaker 0: We cannot create a more equitable or stable economy if people continue to fall into homelessness. And this is this is quite literally at the foundation, a economic stimulus for our local economy, as well as a humanitarian piece of legislation to make sure that people have access to housing and prevent them from falling into homelessness.\nSpeaker 0: So very excited to support this and thank you all for your work on it. Coulson humbled.\nSpeaker 4: I just went to ground. I'll say that we're making today and some quick facts from the losing home report that was commissioned out of my office in collaboration with the Seattle Women's Commission, the Northwest Justice Project, and Washington can.\nSpeaker 4: And some of the findings include the fact that nearly 52% of tenants in eviction filings were people of color of 31.2% were black tenants. And this is an eviction rate of 4.5 times what would be expected based on their demographics.\nSpeaker 4: In Seattle, women were more likely to be evicted over small amounts of money of single tenant households where a tenant owed $100 or less. 81% of those being evicted were women. Tenants faced steep financial costs resulting from an eviction.\nSpeaker 4: The median court judgment was over $3,000, including rent owed non rent charges and legal costs. And nearly 86% of eviction filings were for nonpayment of rent. And of these, 52% were for one month or less in rent. Tenants were required to pay attorney's fees 91% of cases, with a median charge of about $416.\nSpeaker 4: And court costs 92% of cases with a medium charge, median charge of about $360. So, you know, this is this is really those stats are really focused, I think, on not just the basis for why we made changes to the eviction law, both in state law and in in our own local law, in eviction cases that are\nSpeaker 4: related to nonpayment of rent. Now, tenants have more of a right to make an argument about the conditions that lead to nonpayment of rent cases. But in order to make these arguments to address these these really heartbreaking findings from the losing home report, tenants need to have eviction prevention, legal advice from trained attorneys in order to make\nSpeaker 4: make the arguments that that that that for the for the for the application of the new rights that they have since since 2019 changes in the state legislature and in city law as well. So again, just really want to bring it back to the inequities that we see in our in our eviction court system.\nSpeaker 4: And, you know, we can't just always work on improving the the the laws and the rights, but we have to also address people's ability to stand up for them. And I want to thank Councilmember Sawant and all of the tenant advocacy groups who have made that loud that that call loud and clear.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, are there any other comments on the bill as amended elsewhere in the. Lewis, please.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. I will just make a couple of additional remarks to build on what my colleagues have already said. And for me, a big thing that was instructive early on to sign on as a co-sponsor to this critical legislation was the statistic out of New York, which has a robust right to counsel law and has\nSpeaker 2: for some time that 86% of the people. Who were represented in an eviction proceeding, avoided an eviction, which suggests to me in the way that our eviction system is set up and the law around evictions and the courts and how these hearings are conducted and the traditional expectation of who does and does not have representation in those\nSpeaker 2: proceedings has led to thousands, hundreds of thousands nationally of illegal evictions. That when you have counsel in the courtroom and an advocate that can stand with you to address the merits of the case that your landlord is bringing.\nSpeaker 2: Tenants overwhelmingly have been able to stand up and hopefully this will have a deterrent effect as that countervailing power in the courtroom for tenants becomes well known that unmeritorious evictions will no longer be tolerated in Seattle and King County.\nSpeaker 2: And this legislation could end up having a really profound impact and certainly has in other parts of the country. And I really look forward to the impact that we're going to see in our neighbors who are tenants being able to live with a sense of security in reducing the number of our neighbors who fall into a state\nSpeaker 2: of homelessness and end up living in encampments and in vehicles. And I really look forward to the next phase here in making sure we have sufficient appropriation to sustain and build on this right going forward in a city that is majority renter and make sure that this right is vigorously well enforced.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilor Lewis. Any other comments on the bill? Key opens first trust, please.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council President. Thank you to the sponsor of this bill. I'm very excited to vote yes. This is going to have incredible benefits to many people who need legal representation in eviction process proceedings. We're going to see a cascading impact of net benefits because when people are able to be legally represented in legal proceedings, their rights\nSpeaker 2: and they are able to receive the advice that they need to make the decisions to their benefit. So just want to thank the sponsor and thank you, colleagues. I'm excited to vote yes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. I don't see any other hands raised. I also wanted to say thanks for an opportunity to consider this legislation in spite of our disagreement as it relates to Amendment three. I still think that this is the right policy for the city.\nSpeaker 0: I have long advocated for expansion and establishing legal aid programs in a lot of other areas and have in fact been very supportive at the prime sponsors and others efforts to add additional resources for the express purpose of legal aid and prevention of other addictions in our community.\nSpeaker 0: And I think that that and that need related to evictions and the need to have access to a lawyer is that much more important in this period of time where we know that we are facing a tsunami of evictions after the moratoriums are lifted, but before people are able to get back on on foot, on good footing\nSpeaker 0: economically, to be able to catch up on their rent. This council has taken really important steps on other tenant protections that I think we are all proud of and appreciate the opportunity to have a bill that will be able to be implemented quickly and that will be legally defensible in a court of law.\nSpeaker 0: So with that being said, I'm going to hand it over to Councilmember Salant for closing remarks, and then we will call the roll on this bill.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I'm very happy from the comments that councilmembers have made that this bill is likely to pass unanimously. With this legislation, Seattle is about to become the first city in Washington state that guarantees the right to counsel for renters facing eviction.\nSpeaker 3: This victory belongs to the renters light and socialist movement, which my council office is proud to be a part of, and which understands that it takes a fighting strategy to overcome corporate landlords and politicians. Seattle now joined New York, San Francisco, Boulder, Colorado.\nSpeaker 3: Newark, New Jersey. Baltimore, Maryland, among others, in prescribing legal rights for renters facing eviction. Hundreds of community members and many community organizations deserve credit for this victory, particularly the Seattle Tenants Union of Washington State. UAW 4121 Socialist Alternative, the Book Workers Union.\nSpeaker 3: The Housing Justice Project, the American Civil Liberties Union. Both the Washington State affiliate and the National ACLU. Real Change, Transit Riders Union, Faith Action Network, and many others, including the dozens of activists, specifically socialist alternative members, virtually all of whom are struggling workers and renters who collected 468 signatures from working people in our city who strongly support\nSpeaker 3: this legislation. For the last seven years, our Council office has served as a center of organizing for the renters rights movement. We've built powerful movements, fought for and won breakthrough renters rights legislation like the law that bans rent increases in buildings where code violations exist, the ban on winter evictions, a cap on movement fees.\nSpeaker 3: We did all of this through collaboration and unity. Collaboration and unity among ordinary people, workers, rank and file members, community organizations, and individual community members who have no power or influenced by themselves but become strong when we organize together and fight back.\nSpeaker 3: We have won unanimous votes repeatedly by fighting back. As a movement, we celebrate this victory. But we also cannot become complacent because we know that the status quo is still heavily stacked against renters and in favor of corporate landlords.\nSpeaker 3: Landlords are immense power and in many cases power over whether people can afford to remain housed. That is why we still need a huge expansion of social housing by public revenues, that big business. So we need to increase the Amazon tax.\nSpeaker 3: We need to make sure that renters rights themselves are continue to be strengthened. That's why my office and our growing renters rights movement will not rest after today's passage of Labor Council. Our movement will claim today's win as a win for the grassroots movement and will go forward to advance legislation to protect renters from default evictions.\nSpeaker 3: Half of all evictions in Seattle happen by default, meaning the court automatically evict the renter because they did not fill out the paperwork to request a hearing or did not attend the hearing. And often it is the most vulnerable renters who are affected by default, the renters most in need of legal support.\nSpeaker 3: We have heard horror stories of people who are bedridden, who are in a coma or who have dementia being evicted by default without even knowing it is happening. My office is already also working on a moratorium on evictions of schoolchildren and their families during the months of the school year, as was suggested importantly by school board member\nSpeaker 3: , we have also been working on legislation requiring landlords to have to meet a just standard for all evictions by closing the current loophole that allows landlords and tenants without cause. We are also preparing to develop legislation creating standardized dance for rental leases.\nSpeaker 3: The reality is the average renter in Seattle has no opportunity to negotiate or alter even the smallest part of their lives when they move into a house or apartment. As a result, many leases have outrageous terms, so we do need to continue to strengthen renters rights to have a full bill of renters rights.\nSpeaker 3: And even that will not be enough. We will need to fight for rent control. We will need to fight to cancel rent and mortgage and utility debt for those who are struggling because of income or job losses, because of the pandemic and the recession.\nSpeaker 3: I congratulate everybody who fought to win this. Let's keep going. When we fight, we want.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, colleagues, we're going to go ahead and call this vote now. Debate is officially closed and I'm going to ask that the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the amended bill.\nSpeaker 1: Most Jetta I.\nSpeaker 2: Peterson I.\nSpeaker 1: So want.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Strauss Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Herbold Yes. Suarez, I.\nSpeaker 2: Lewis Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Morales Yes. President Gonzalez. I line in favor. None opposed.\nSpeaker 0: The bill passes as amended and the chair will sign it.

And I think we have had many iterations. I think this might be my fourth time in front of you to discuss how since March to discuss how to help the tenants.\nSpeaker 4: What can we do? I think we all can agree that this situation has gone on longer than any of us could have imagined. Initially in March, we had talked about doing a 60 day program for our tenants, and then we added another 30 days for 90 days.\nSpeaker 4: And it's October. And there's sort of I mean, we can't we cannot see the horizon, I think. And so I think we are back here seeking some concrete action, some steps from the council. And I'm just going to walk you through where we are, how we got I mean I mean, you guys, you know how we got\nSpeaker 4: here, but I'm just going to walk you through where we are, what our thoughts are, and then just let you guys kind of continue to grapple with this. And hopefully by the end of your grappling, we will have a clear path of what we can offer to our tenants, because really that's what we want to do, is\nSpeaker 4: that it's it is October. And so far all we've been able to offer our tenants definitively is the 90 day deferral. And we have offered that to our tenants with a repayment to start in October and it is October.\nSpeaker 4: And and that may not have been enough for some of them. So let me just walk you through the three things that we're discussing tonight. So the first thing I think we should talk about is the loan conversion program, which you approved in May and April May, which to remind you, is the program where the tenants can\nSpeaker 4: apply for a six month deferral. And then we would meet with the tenants and negotiate some benchmarks, performance measures that that would potentially turn a portion or all of that loan into a grant. The program was fashioned after the Federal Government PGP program, and at the time when we when the Council approved it, we we we feel\nSpeaker 4: we don't we feel that there was not a lot of clarity about the magnitude of what you guys were were thinking about. And so when we introduced the program to our tenants and the numbers came back very large.\nSpeaker 4: And so rather than rather than than granting large grants or programs to our tenants, we are asking the council to give us a large fund that we can then negotiate and figure out how to help the tenants. Some of you received some information about some of the specifics that some of the tenants requested.\nSpeaker 4: We are asking for $1.5 million to have that, give the city manager some flexibility to negotiate with some of the tenants and offer relief. In the staff report, you'll note that some of the tenants pay up to $60,000 a month in rent.\nSpeaker 4: And so some of the the citywide program that offered $10,000, 70 $500, would not have made a dent in the operating obligations of some of these tenants, which is why we're asking you to consider this this fund. In addition, some of our tenants lease over 100,000 square feet and so their rents are large.\nSpeaker 4: And also of note is that the city offered about $1,000,000 for citywide programs for those smaller grants and and for assistance. So the 1.5 is for Alameda point is on par with what was offered citywide. So we feel like if you gave if you allotted that 1.5, we could have it go a long way between it with\nSpeaker 4: our tenants. In addition, the loan conversion program that you put forward was specifically designed for your larger employers. The council said you wanted them to have more than 25 employees or to have a significant impact on the sales tax revenue.\nSpeaker 4: And so there were some applicants that we received that we turned away because they did not meet that benchmark. And so we are hoping that the council will give us that fund to be able to then negotiate with the tenants and figure out a way out.\nSpeaker 4: And so when after the council approved that program and we saw that it didn't quite meet the needs of everyone. More specifically, I received several calls from our Spirits Alley tenants. And, you know, they were hard hit and we knew that they were going to be hard hit because they're they're like they're sort of like the wine\nSpeaker 4: tasting facilities in Sonoma that they can't open up. And there are many of them. As you know, our big hole in Spirits Alley is food service. So many of them don't serve food, so they couldn't get around that obligation.\nSpeaker 4: So they were just closed and they were creative doing, you know, the drive by pick up of growlers of beer and and your wine club pickup. So they were being creative. However, it just wasn't enough. And then when the county opened up and the fires impacted them so they couldn't have the outdoor activity.\nSpeaker 4: And so the Spirits Alley tenants were, they were being hammered every which way. So I received many calls from them and it became clear that they needed a little something extra. So the city manager and I, we kind of we created this this other program that specifically designed for our nonprofits and our Spirit Alley tenants.\nSpeaker 4: And it is not a grant conversion. So the 1.5 that we're asking for is separate from this. And this is a deferral program where the tenants can get up to nine months of deferred rent. So really what this does in reality for our tenants is it takes them to the end of the year.\nSpeaker 4: Some of the tenants have them paying, but they do need like meeting breathing room. And so it gives them nine months of deferred rent, but then they have to pay it back over a three year period of time.\nSpeaker 4: So so what happens is in the first year, they'll pay they'll pay their regular rent plus three months of the rent that they that was deferred. This is similar to your rent deferral program that you offered to your other tenants because we gave the other tenants one year to pay back three months of rent.\nSpeaker 4: So what we're doing is we're giving Spirit's Alley and your nonprofits three years to pay back three years of rent. Now we know that we're not going to be and this well, we hope that we're not going to be in this pandemic forever.\nSpeaker 4: And so we miss McCord.\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry, interrupt. You were saying we're giving them three years to pay back. Three years of rent.\nSpeaker 4: They owe three years of pay back nine months. And there.\nSpeaker 1: You go. My blood pressure went back down.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, great. So we we hope that this this pandemic doesn't last forever, and some of our tenants may bounce back more quickly. And so we're giving an incentive that if they bounce back more quickly and they pay off that nine months rent, let's say that.\nSpeaker 4: So for every year early that they pay it off, we will defer one month, we will abate one month rent so that tenants could get up to three months of abated rent. And that is just an incentive just to try to help them if if the money's coming in, that they'll pay us and so we can be\nSpeaker 4: closer to becoming whole. We feel very confident, by the way, about both of these programs because even with the pandemic and you've seen this in the staff report, even when the Bananas hit the fan in March, we closed our fiscal year with a $2 million excess.\nSpeaker 4: And so we think that we have a lot of wiggle room. Our fund balance is healthy. And I know that the other thing in the back of you guys is mine is development, development, development, that we have to not just rely on this interim stage, that we need to get the infrastructure in the ground.\nSpeaker 4: But we do feel that we need to stand alongside of our tenants who have been with us in the difficult times. So it is sort of an investment. One thing that I want to remind you guys is this is not money going from us to the tenant.\nSpeaker 4: It is money coming from our fund balance to go into our operating budget. So it is it is us loaning the money to us to continue our operations and then the tenants will pay us back. So it is not like money just out the door.\nSpeaker 4: I just want to remind you of that. The last thing the last part of this action is for the Alameda Theater. Way back in April, you guys, we received a proposal from the Alameda Theater. And you might remember there were four components of that proposal.\nSpeaker 4: And we we addressed all four except one of them. We were not able to completely address. And that was the tenant's request to to just roll let me let me make sure I say this correctly without misspeaking. So it was the tenants request to roll back the rent to 2010 until a vaccine was widely available in California\nSpeaker 4: . So the council wasn't too enamored with making a financial decision based on a vaccine. So what we came up with was we were we said this tenant is eligible for all of our like a loan conversion program that we just approved.\nSpeaker 4: And and they could they could that could happen. But then we hit a roadblock because deferring rent on the theater impacts an obligation that we have for paying back our Section 108 loan. The Section 108 loan, which we took out when we were building the theater and parking garage, is backed by the Reds from the theater complex\nSpeaker 4: . And so we are unable to just completely defer rent for the theater because we have this other obligation that needs to be paid. And so what we had come up with, the recommendation that we came up with at the time was that we would grant we would loan the money to the theater.\nSpeaker 4: And again, this is a money transfer from one fund into our operating fund or into the debt service fund for the Section 108 loan, basically. So we would loan we would loan the money to the theater. They wouldn't have to pay rent.\nSpeaker 4: And that debt won't become payable until they exercised their option for a longer term, which is in 2037. Or if we negotiate that they want to buy the building and we negotiate a price. There's a price already set in the DDA or in the lease, by the way, but we might want to change that or something.\nSpeaker 4: We would put the dollar amount that we're loaning the theater on top of that purchase price so that this obligation will come due 17 years from now or or whenever they decide to buy the the theater. It is not something that's imminent or heavy on the theater operations.\nSpeaker 4: We thought that that was a gentle transition. Now, I know that you guys were contacted by by the theater operator about where did where did that come up with that $315,000 number? Well, what was missing from my staff report was the complex, because all the rents from a theater complex are go are pledged to the Section 108\nSpeaker 4: loan. And so that is about $315,000 for that nine month period. We may not need to use it all. We may need to use it all. I just wanted to put that dollar amount there in case we needed to use it.\nSpeaker 4: So it is and it would not be the sole obligate obligation of the theater owner. Each individual business would have the obligation on their own. But I approached the project as one project, the theater complex. So tonight what we're asking you guys to do is number one.\nSpeaker 4: Set aside the $1.5 million for the city manager and staff to administer their loan conversion program. Finally, I want you to know that we approved that program in April and May, and we have not made a decision on any of those applications.\nSpeaker 4: So so the tenants have been waiting and they provided us with a lot of information. We've gone through their financials. We've asked a lot of follow up questions. But and but we want to make sure that we're on the same magnitude that you guys are on.\nSpeaker 4: Number two, what we're asking for is, would you guys entertain this other program that's specific to Spirit's Alley and nonprofits? Now, the nine month repayment, nine month over a three year repayment program. I would like to offer that to anybody who did a loan conversion grant in case they want to do that, so that our loan conversion\nSpeaker 4: application, so that we would not be in the grant situation with some of those tenants, but instead they could get the nine months and repay over the three year period. I'd like to extend that to them just because they've been waiting a long time and there's lots of uncertainty.\nSpeaker 4: And then finally, we're just asking you to appropriate the $315,000. It may not be that much. It may be a little less from the general fund reserves to help the theater complex, and mostly it is to help the city meet its obligations for the Section 108 loan.\nSpeaker 4: Finally, I just want to say one thing to you guys is that I know you have been grappling with this since March about how to help our tenants, but I want you to feel encouraged about some of the things that our tenants are doing to help themselves.\nSpeaker 4: One of the tenants who is an applicant for the loan conversion program is a business that would be done because of COVID. They there that their core business would not allow them to operate at all. But what they did was they immediately changed their their operations and they instead of manufacturing the thing that they did that would\nSpeaker 4: not be allowed or would not be marketable under COVID. They started making prefab panels for multifamily housing. They just completely changed their business model. And they are now becoming very competitive and selling these that these panels for prefab housing.\nSpeaker 4: And that was something they did quickly. And we think that we would acknowledge that innovation of our tenant and being able to keep the jobs, keep the operations and be at Alameda Point, we think that they should be acknowledged.\nSpeaker 4: We have another tenant who, you know, they could ask for the six months they've asked for three because that's all they really need to get by. And we think that that that is the candidate for the loan conversion program.\nSpeaker 4: And we just think that there have been a lot of there's been a lot of innovation. You guys know one tenant who who was, you know, their their business model. It was not compatible with, you know, the shut down, the shelter in place.\nSpeaker 4: And they started using their their facility to make hand sanitizer and to distribute it throughout the city. One of our tenants offered up their property, their driveway, for nonprofits to do certain events in their driveways to help people.\nSpeaker 4: And so I think that the people who are applying for this and asking for help are tenants who are committed to our city and who have shown some leadership. They responded to the things that you guys said you want it, which was, you know, people who are going to step up.\nSpeaker 4: And so I think that the applicants that we have on hand that you would be very pleased to stand alongside of them. And and basically, I want to just say that we feel that tonight we are addressing our two big anchors in Alameda, Spirit Valley and the theater.\nSpeaker 4: Both of them have become part of the Alameda identity. And we think that we need to assist and helping them continue. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. McConnell. That was an inspiring presentation by the man. Do we have public speakers?\nSpeaker 2: We do not have any public comment.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So then, counsel, you can do a combination of your. I see your hand up. Give me a sec. We can do a combination of questions you may have for staff and your comments. Why don't we start with Councilmember Vela?\nSpeaker 5: So I want to start with some questions that I had. And obviously, we've given some direction previously, and Mr. McCarney touched on that. But I just want to clarify a couple points. So I know this comes out of this isn't necessarily money out of our pocket, but does this impact other our ability to pay for other things\nSpeaker 5: at Alameda Point. Because potentially this money is getting put into a fund and that fund is supposed to be paying for certain things. So have we calculated the impact on that?\nSpeaker 4: Now what is it? Okay, sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt. So this money is coming out of a fine balance. And so right now we have many we have about $16 million in our fund balance. So it's very healthy.\nSpeaker 4: That is enough to operate alameda point. If no money came in for a year. Our operating budget is about $14 million. So we have a very healthy fund balance and we're lucky. And so in the past, I would just tell you that in the past, the council felt that $2 million fine balance was really good, and that\nSpeaker 4: was our rainy day fund. So right now we're in a very good place and it's mostly because of the really competitive deals that you guys have approved in the last few years. And I mean, I just want to compliment you that even in the reduction of the Mirage ships, which is one of our largest tenants, we managed\nSpeaker 4: to continue to be, you know, pretty, pretty competitive and have a great revenue generation at the base. So.\nSpeaker 5: So I think my question is, if everybody defaults. Worst case scenario, if everybody defaults, right.\nSpeaker 4: We would be okay.\nSpeaker 5: And then. But are there any be.\nSpeaker 1: Okay for a time? Right.\nSpeaker 4: For a time. For a. I mean, I think she's asking of everybody who got the loan defaulted on.\nSpeaker 1: And couldn't pay back.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, that's 1.5 million. We're talking about 1.5 million in a $14 million portfolio.\nSpeaker 6: So, yeah, I'll answer it.\nSpeaker 1: A city manager.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I. I'll answer a little different. I mean, obviously the fund balance is used for a variety of things and I mean a point and I agree with and, and that that if just the loans were defaulted, that would be 1,000,005.\nSpeaker 6: I think what we're really trying to do is look at the other side and what I think the Nats proposals are for is that we're trying to help. And this might be a little bit of an overstatement. I hope not is save some of these businesses and help them to succeed in moving forward.\nSpeaker 6: And then so it's not really on the default side, it's more what I think the Nats proposals which I have agreed with is to try to preserve those businesses out there so that we will have long term revenues.\nSpeaker 6: I don't think the loan program is to provide just assistance. I think it's to provide assistance to help them stay to to try to sustain through the COVID and become healthy businesses and stay out there and be healthy for the long term.\nSpeaker 6: So I think it's not necessarily the default and on that side, because if it is defaults, we will have to to readjust expenditures out there. I think what she's trying to do is create long term revenue sources for for the base based on preserving these businesses and helping them move through the COVID.\nSpeaker 5: And potentially there's a bigger problem, correct. If they if they default, because it means that potentially there's a larger issue and we perhaps are losing an anchor tenant. Correct.\nSpeaker 6: That would that could be correct, yes.\nSpeaker 4: Just that the proposal for the loan conversion program way back when, which you guys might not remember, is that we had discussed negotiating promissory notes for the tenant that would be crossed, defaulted with their lease. So if there is a default, the lease is defaulted.\nSpeaker 4: Probably all of these tenants have a security deposit. So there is some recouping of funds there. Right. So we do have a little bit of cushion.\nSpeaker 0: I do think you clarify just slightly.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Just to clarify for the council. The 1.5 million that we're asking to be allocated to the city manager to make decisions about a loan forgiveness program. It is possible that the assistance that we would provide would be up to 1.5 million in loan forgiveness.\nSpeaker 0: That's not a default, and it's not intended to be repaid to the city. But the potential for a default is on a nine month of deferred rent for the spirits, Ali, and the nonprofit businesses who then are being given three years to repay that that loan.\nSpeaker 0: So I just want to.\nSpeaker 4: Know if there's a chance that we don't differ all I mean, we don't get all of that loan. So there is a chance that the tenant could default in the loan conversion program. But we're not saying.\nSpeaker 0: Right or that we may not want to give.\nSpeaker 4: Fodder for the loan conversion program. Does it mean they're going to get a grant? It's a possibility, but that's all negotiated.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. And I just want to clarify what we're we're making a decision on tonight is not on the not on the the loan conversion, but on the additional 1.5 million where we give them the nine months of deferral, correct?\nSpeaker 4: No, sorry. It's confusing. So there's three components. The $1.5 million is specifically for the loan conversion program that allows the city manager and gives us some room to negotiate what you know, how much we would allow or grant to each tenant.\nSpeaker 4: And as you know, right.\nSpeaker 5: Before you continue, is that in addition and this is a question for the city manager, is that in addition to the authority that we already gave about this, up to the previous authority that we gave was up to a certain amount.\nSpeaker 5: Well, we did not all of the way.\nSpeaker 1: It went at a time when it is, as the council member said. Okay. Mr. Connor. Then, Mr. Levitt.\nSpeaker 4: It wasn't clear to us what the authority was. That's why we haven't awarded any of those grants, because we were we were not sure how much we had to work with. And that is why we're asking for the $1.5 million.\nSpeaker 0: And it is additional authority to do so on top of the prior authority that was granted to the city manager for citywide activities. This 1.5 million would be in addition to that.\nSpeaker 5: Well, some 1 million.\nSpeaker 6: Maybe I can clarify. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Let's hear from the city, man.\nSpeaker 6: I'm not sure whether I'll clarify to confuse, but I think there are three. I try to simplify and say there are three basic actions that council has done during COVID. I mean, there's been a lot of smaller pieces during that.\nSpeaker 6: One was and I think this might be why you talk about the you gave opportunity to defer rent I believe as for 60 and then we extended to 90 days, we did not provide any forgiveness of loans during that time because like then that said, we I had a concern in particular that any forgiveness was not specifically\nSpeaker 6: authorized by council. So we did not doing forgiveness. We just did deferrals of three months, up to three months during that time. Then there was obviously the grant programs to businesses as well as to there was 100,000 that was given to.\nSpeaker 6: Up to 100,000 is given at Alameda Point because there is me a point and then other grants that were given to other businesses through the competitive grant program. And then the third was the 2 million and the 2 million.\nSpeaker 6: All that went into the 2 million. But that was not. This is not an addition to that.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: So we have so kilometer radius here. And it's just a.\nSpeaker 3: Point of clarification. I mean, looking at the plate, looking at the minutes from I think it was May 19, the motion was to give staff authority to provide any three month deferral and up to an additional three month deferral per tenant, which would be converted into a promissory note.\nSpeaker 3: And then we get put a cap on a Bateman and you're going to come back and talk about removing that cap. So I think it was six months worth of deferral that we authorized. So it's not unclear to me because I read the minutes.\nSpeaker 3: So I made the motion.\nSpeaker 6: So so what the the unclear part was, was whether or not we could do forgiveness. So that's what I went on. And we didn't do any forgiveness of any of that. That's what I said.\nSpeaker 1: So, my fella, you're next.\nSpeaker 5: So, yeah. So so my question is really because as part of that motion and on May 19th, we gave a specific cap on abatement. What I'm what I'm not clear on is what is the ask from staff. You want to be able to abate all 1.5 million.\nSpeaker 5: You want to be able to abate what is the cap that you're looking for? Because we gave you a number back then. You didn't exercise that. And now I'm concerned that you're asking us essentially to write a $1.5 million check to you where there is no review by counsel of what money gets given out as grants to\nSpeaker 5: whom and to and what percentage to which business. So if you could walk me through that, I'd appreciate it. That questions for the city manager. I would like to hear from the city.\nSpeaker 1: And may I just ask for clarification from you? Councilmember Avila, are you suggesting that the council should get to approve what loan is made, to which business, or that we.\nSpeaker 5: Know.\nSpeaker 0: And.\nSpeaker 1: Criteria.\nSpeaker 5: Approve a program, the process criteria. And I just I haven't seen that proposed in the in the thing. And so I'm I'm kind of wondering where this all fits together. So I don't want to be involved in the individual decision making.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. So there.\nSpeaker 1: Was neither.\nSpeaker 6: So there was no deferrals made because they are not deferrals, but no forgiveness made because I read it more conservatively on that and was concerned that I did not want to surpass my authority because. Doing forgiveness would be equivalent to an expenditure.\nSpeaker 6: We have a 75,000 cap expenditure. I want to make sure if I was going to air, I had more on the conservative side on that particular one and we did have the we have done deferrals of the rent.\nSpeaker 6: But as far as forgiveness, we have not done the 1.5 billion is a cap which could be forgiven up to that 1.5 million if you want to put more restrictions on it. I'm open to hearing that and we are open to hearing that and moving those in there.\nSpeaker 6: But unless I am wrong then that the 1.5 could be that could be the limit on the forgiveness within those loans.\nSpeaker 4: You're right.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And then, is there a potter?\nSpeaker 1: I see Mr. Potter with your hands up. Let's hear from her. She might have so other information.\nSpeaker 0: Right. So thank you. The 1.5 million. It would be a cap. It would be a maximum. We have received six or seven applications to date.\nSpeaker 4: That have met.\nSpeaker 0: The eligibility requirements for the program as previously adopted by counsel, so that this 1.5 million would be spread across a number of businesses who have asked for assistance. And then I wanted to respond to Councilmember Vela's point. That criteria were established for what needed to be met to go from from deferral to abatement.\nSpeaker 0: The council did that in the spring. They were things like bringing back your workers, innovating, you know, working with the community. There were a number of criteria. We are not proposing any changes to that criteria that were previously established.\nSpeaker 0: We are just seeking, as the city manager has said, the authorization and clarity that there is understanding that the request is for a 1.4 or $1.5 billion pot of money that could be applied to businesses based on staff's analysis of need, and then of how the criteria for the program to to qualify for abatement is met.\nSpeaker 0: And so that we wouldn't be bringing back the individual proposals to the Council, rather, we would work within the criteria and the capped amount of money so that that's our proposal about how to move this forward.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, counselor. Did you finish before I got to the next speaker?\nSpeaker 5: No, I had a couple more questions about that.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: So in terms of the up to three months of abatement on the deferral, how is that going to work if somebody defers four months of rent? Is it is it is the proposal that you get one month's for every three months you pay early?\nSpeaker 5: So if I if I have the nine months deferred, but I pay three months or two, how do I have to pay all nine months ahead of time and then I get three months back? How is that going to work?\nSpeaker 4: You get one month for every year that you pay back early, so the maximum that you could get deferred would be three months. So if it's so, if in one year a tenant pays back everything. They would get three months of deferred rent or baby.\nSpeaker 5: But if they're but if they've only if they've only deferred three months, they would get out or they only deferred four months. How does that work?\nSpeaker 4: And.\nSpeaker 5: Well, it just seems like the wording is kind of open. So I'm trying to understand.\nSpeaker 4: Well. So the thing is, is that most of the tenants who are are they need more than three months. I mean, because we've already given them the three month deferral just carte blanche in the beginning, we gave them the three months and the one year to repay it.\nSpeaker 4: Everybody has that possibility.\nSpeaker 5: But so then if people if the people that repay that, will they be getting the one month? Will this also apply to them?\nSpeaker 1: And I'm just going to ask that that one speaker let the other one finish. Ms.. Mercado, we're still speaking, but go ahead.\nSpeaker 4: One. So, no, this is just for spirits, ally and nonprofit. So it's a it's a it's a finite group of people. And it is the people who have been hardest hit, who've been unable to open all of our museums.\nSpeaker 4: You know, they have been unable to open. So and it's and it's it's from March till October. So they we anticipate that those people and I have heard from the Spirits Alley people you know Spirits Alley people are they're not able to open and they're also getting huge tax bills right now.\nSpeaker 4: And I mean, it's just everything is compounding on them. So the nine months just gets them to the end of the year.\nSpeaker 5: Right. But I guess my my question still stands, which is in the event that they don't need the whole nine months. Are we going to clarify? Is that.\nSpeaker 6: The way I would interpret.\nSpeaker 5: This three months?\nSpeaker 1: Mr. LEVITT.\nSpeaker 6: The way I interpret is that they could get the three. So if they only did three months and they prepaid it for three. They prepaid it within the policy that's being proposed. They could get up still to the three months abated, is that correct?\nSpeaker 6: Is that correct? That's the way I read it.\nSpeaker 4: I would say that not the are the nine and three. The nine and three is really our base. So if you only take three months and you pay it back in a year, you get one month abated. If you if you take six months and you pay it back in two years, you get two months abated.\nSpeaker 4: I think we would just do it across the time frame.\nSpeaker 0: As a prorated asset.\nSpeaker 1: I was going to say prorated and could come in handy. Okay.\nSpeaker 5: All right. So I. Okay. I just wanted to clarify, basically, if it's prorated or if it's just a lump sum. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: And you make clear to the tenants if you guys approve this.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then we'll go into Councilmember Odio.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks. Thanks, Matt. So just some clarifying questions. So just so I can be clear, the 1.5 million. That is. Well, help me. What is that? That's the. The abatement portion of it.\nSpeaker 4: That is the loan and potential abatement portion of it. So and it's and it's up to six months. So if I'm a tenant and I've put in my application for $250,000, the city would enter into a promissory note for $250,000.\nSpeaker 4: With some benchmarks, employees return, you know, sales tax generation, you've got a competitive business plan. And then if you meet those requirements, let's say, in 24 months, the city would consider a building all or a portion of that.\nSpeaker 4: And it's going to be negotiable. And so that's so that so that $250,000 is spoken for off of that 1.5. Okay. If if we're going to abate the whole thing, if we decide we just would only abate $100,000 of that.\nSpeaker 4: So $100,000 comes off of that 1.5. And so the tenant is on the hook for $150,000 repayment plan.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So that's a little bit different than the way I heard it explained. But that could just me not understanding it. So. I thought we were only considering a building up to three months over a course of three years.\nSpeaker 3: And now you're saying, you know, we could add staff action to nine months worth of rent up to next month. The company. Okay. Well, that's a little bit different. And then on the theater, um, I think there's a, a line in the staff report that talked about deferral on page four and then a line that says abatement\nSpeaker 3: on page five. And those are different. Not that I would have any issue with either one of them, but I mean, are we proposing an abatement for the theater or we're proposing a deferral?\nSpeaker 4: Um, I, I think that we're proposing, um, I think, I think initially we're proposing a deferral and the deferral is until 2037 or when they, if they decide to purchase the, the facility now that's, that's, that's like how it we left it back in April or May.\nSpeaker 4: But what I would say is that it, there's, um, it's a lot of time between now and 2037 and I would say that all of us are invested in the success of the Alameda Theater. And so I would I would say that after that Section 108 loan is paid off, which is in 2027, I if I were\nSpeaker 4: the theater operator, I would come back to the council and say, you don't need my money anymore to pay this obligation, and perhaps you would consider an abatement of this obligation. Um, it's a long time away and a lot can happen.\nSpeaker 4: And, um, and so I think it's, it's better for the theater operator and it's better for us to meet the immediate need and, and figure out the obligation of repayment when it's more imminent.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I mean.\nSpeaker 1: I would just add that if you read the resolution that was drafted in that will be voting on unless it is amended on the, uh, the next to the last. Whereas, um, sorry, the, uh, it then yeah, the next to the last.\nSpeaker 1: Whereas on page one says whereas Stafford, you have to build the conversion applications but over and, and the nine months of rent deferral for the Alameda Theater. So that is what is proposed to me. And who was I?\nSpeaker 1: Was that you? Mr.. Mr.. That is something. And Mr. Leavitt has his hands up.\nSpeaker 6: So I think.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's Eric. Yes. Yeah.\nSpeaker 6: So I think, I think the theater's a this is all very complicated, but the theater's definitely an important entity in Alameda. And I think we see this is or at least I view this as an interim approach to at least try to to help them in the near term, but that we would be coming back with more\nSpeaker 6: the possible proposals, including forgiveness with the theater. The complicating factor that we're trying to work through, which I think and that was explaining, was that because it's tied to a loan. So when Alma did loans, I think they wisely did.\nSpeaker 6: They tied them to revenue sources. The revenue source that part of this loan was tied to was payments coming from the theater. So if we forgive that, then we're going to have to make up those payments for that loan from some other source, such as the general fund.\nSpeaker 6: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: I appreciate that clarification.\nSpeaker 1: And I think Ms.. Mercado might have wanted to clarify further. Mr.. If you can hold on.\nSpeaker 4: I just am going to piggyback on what the city manager said, which is if we default on that Section one eight loan, then that we would no longer receive any CDBG money from the federal government, HUD for its HUD funds.\nSpeaker 4: And as you guys are well aware, that is that is funding that goes to our most vulnerable populations. So that's why we have we like very concerned about making sure that that the theater can pay its obligations.\nSpeaker 6: But but.\nSpeaker 1: But if.\nSpeaker 6: I could just add the reason. The other complicating factor is, as you may have read, like Regal Theaters has put out an announcement that nationally they're going to be at least closing them at least for some time here in the near future.\nSpeaker 6: I don't know if I care or if I read those permit or just for over a period of time. But I think those same factors are affecting our theater here. That the local theater.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. And Mr. Brody, back to you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I mean, to that point, you know, when the theater owner spoke to at least me back in May, they were anticipating that a 4th of July reopening. And that hasn't happened. And given the fact that there's a complete denial in Washington now that this thing even exists, I don't think we're going to see anything until\nSpeaker 3: January or February. So I'm all for helping out the theater. I'd like to see us do a little bit more than was proposed. You know, we've we've offered you know, there's been a plan to abate rent for some of our other tenants.\nSpeaker 3: But I'd like to see some plan that we could possibly abate rent for the theater, maybe in exchange for additional community benefits. I think there are other ways we can also help the theater. I know that, you know.\nSpeaker 3: That's the city owned property. Right. And, you know, AMP is providing power to that. So I'm more than happy to approve anything related to theater and even more than than we've we've suggested. So I'll just leave that aside.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember.\nSpeaker 3: I'm not done yet, though. I mean, I'm done with the theater, but Ms.. Mercado may have her hand up, so. Yeah, that's my question.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Puerto Ricans remind.\nSpeaker 4: You that you have done you have already waived the percentage rent payment for this year, which was $175,000. You've already waived it for next year, which is anticipated. We don't know what it will be. Might be nothing because they haven't had any revenue.\nSpeaker 4: You've already increased the percentage rent number four in perpetuity. So the city has done a lot to help the theater. And and this one is just an outlier. And I'm sure that we would have done more, but we were like, we're we're sweating that Section 108 payment.\nSpeaker 3: And so I'm perfectly happy to sign off on that.\nSpeaker 1: Um, again, I'm not sure what's in the air or water, but please, let's let one speaker finish before we start. I think Mr. Cano is about to wrap up your jam. Okay, Mr. Odie, back to you.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks. So just a couple clarifying then. How are we defining the tenant as far as the 1.5 million?\nSpeaker 4: We had some we had some criteria that we listed that, you know, for the $1.5 million, they've had to have over 25, 25 employer employees. They had to be consistent with a long term plan for Alameda Point. So it can't be a tenant that's in a building that's eventually going to go away and they have to be\nSpeaker 4: a sales tax generator. So we we were specific about either jobs or sales tax. We were specific about who would be eligible for that that pot of money.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. That's thank you. But that's a different question. I mean, how are we defining attendance? Is it to someone that we have a lease arrangement with? That the council has approved only. Only. Quote unquote, tenants out there that have council approved leases are going to be eligible.\nSpeaker 3: Correct.\nSpeaker 1: Are you thinking of some particular example, Mr. Rudy?\nSpeaker 3: I just want to make sure we're defining Tenet as Tenet. Because if you have, you know, some tenants or licensees or whatever, I mean, I want to make sure that, you know, really they're interested in that.\nSpeaker 4: Sorry. I'm sorry, Mayor. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to start up.\nSpeaker 3: I stopped.\nSpeaker 4: Now we have we have one applicant who is under. They are in law. They are on a long term license that expired and has gone month to month. And we were in the throes of doing a long term lease with them, but we were smacked in the face with the Surplus Land Act.\nSpeaker 4: So we that we would consider them a tenant because they were caught in the middle of the over of some something external to our operations. We do have a lot of trepidation about that, and I think the city manager is majorly conservative about the relationship that we would have with them.\nSpeaker 4: And however, I don't think that we would exclude them from consideration because. Only they have multiple. They have one least with us that did come to council. That's now on a month to month only because we can't come to you with a longer term lease.\nSpeaker 4: So I think that one would be a little bit more tricky. But the rest of these people who have applied have leases that have come to the council. There's just one strange.\nSpeaker 3: I don't remember signing off on a month to month lease, lease or license now either.\nSpeaker 4: So it's in a hold over because it expired and we can't renew it because of this new Plus Lands Act.\nSpeaker 3: So is it a license or is it a lease?\nSpeaker 4: There's that they have multiple properties, so they have a lease that's in a holdover and they have a couple of licenses that that we are we can renew those for up to one year that renew themselves under the Surplus Lands Act.\nSpeaker 4: But we have to be super careful.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And then my other question, I remember my next one was how are we qualifying? I think you answered that previously. So if we decide to give some abatement, I mean, are these lease amendments that have to come back?\nSpeaker 3: Because I know we did have a discussion with one of our tenants that we approved. I want to say it was last meeting where we actually amended the lease. Because it is what it seems to me here is we're trying to do this in a vacuum where you have a list of people that you think are qualified\nSpeaker 3: , but we can't reveal that to the public. So there's a to me a little bit of a transparency issue that we're kind of skirting around, you know, who's actually going to get this money and definitely not willing to tell the public or the council who those people are.\nSpeaker 3: So, I mean, is that is it at some point we're going to have a public discussion on that? And if not, that's fine. But just let me know.\nSpeaker 1: What I was gonna say. Is it. And then the city attorney can certainly feel free to weigh in on this, but are we not talking about a business arrangement between our tenants and our our property management staff?\nSpeaker 0: What's the city.\nSpeaker 1: That the city attorney do you want to weigh in?\nSpeaker 3: It would be my current understanding that any changes to the lease that's existing would come to council for final approval unless Mr. McConnell or Ms.. Potter sees this differently. I would expect that if we are making fundamental changes to the underlying lease, that that would come to the Council for approval.\nSpeaker 4: Initially, we had said that we would enter into these promissory notes that would be defaulted with the lease. I do not believe that it was our intention to come back to the Council with the promissory notes. That is your decision on the program that we're talking about with up to nine months and the three over three.\nSpeaker 4: We those we said that would be done by a lease amendment. I think that this could come to the council, I guess. And but I think and I, I think we're not opposed to coming to the council. But I would just tell you that my, my initial hesitation is with the with the conversion and abatement.\nSpeaker 4: Is that. We developed this program in April and it's October. And our tenant, I mean, I just for the expediency for helping our tenants, that would be my only hesitation.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So then help me with some boundaries then. So nonprofit. That's just a five. The 1c3. Right. That's who's eligible. Okay. And then spiritually, is there a boundary around who would be eligible?\nSpeaker 4: It's the tenants are monarch.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So any tenant on monarch, whether they are, you know, alcohol, spirit producing brewery, whatever. Right. So they have to have a monarch in their address.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: So then help me. The difference between the rent assistance program and the nonprofit Spirits Alley, is that one bucket of money or is it two buckets of money? What are we looking at here?\nSpeaker 4: So it's it's one bucket of money. It's all five, eight, five, eight, which is the base we use to fund. The $1.5 million is coming out of the an appropriated fund balance and then the the not the. So that's spoken for from the bottom line.\nSpeaker 4: Under the bottom line. Just think about it that way. And then the program, the nine month, three year program is operating of the operating fund of the $40 million anticipated. We would adjust our revenue projections accordingly and it would probably lower our revenue projection in this year and this fiscal year.\nSpeaker 4: It would raise it over the next three years anticipating the repayment of those funds.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I guess what I'm still unclear about is what is the maximum amount of potential rent abatement authority that you're asking for? Is it 1.5 million? Is it 1.5 million plus something extra for spirits, nonprofits? Is it some other number?\nSpeaker 4: It is. It is the second one. It is the 1.5 million plus whatever the whatever the tenets, hospitality and nonprofits ask for over the three year period of time.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I just. I'm not.\nSpeaker 1: Here. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. I'm just sorry. And just to qualify, it's for the Spirits Alley and the nonprofits. The maximum abatement would be three months of rent abatement over a three year period. If every one of those tenants repaid early. Otherwise, it is simply a deferment or a rent deferral.\nSpeaker 0: It is. The only abate portion of that is if.\nSpeaker 4: You.\nSpeaker 0: Repay early and then you have a max of three months of. Of abatement, and that would happen over a three year period. So it would start next year and go forward three years. So it really is a future looking program.\nSpeaker 0: So 1.5 is an immediate authority that would start as quickly as these deals are associated.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The city manager has his hands up.\nSpeaker 6: So I have maybe an alternative option that wasn't in the report as an alternative, but it's off the same concept. So maybe an alternative. Great.\nSpeaker 1: You need to move around here. It's good for your circulation. Yes.\nSpeaker 6: So maybe an alternative would be. If you approve the program as presented the two parts as presented the nine month deferral and the and the 1.5 that if it's a deferral with a repayment in the let's say the 1.5, if it's a repayment, then that will could be approved at a staff level at my level by the\nSpeaker 6: if there was any abatement that was agreed to in that, that that would be a change in the lease rent that we would get throughout the lease. So in that case, as an abatement, it would have to come back for a lease amendment to council.\nSpeaker 6: That might be an option, if you like, the program with concern about too much, about the concern about having too broad a span for the abatement we could have. If there's an abatement that would have to come back as an amendment to the Council for approval, I just want to throw that out as an alternative option.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Well, I mean, I'll just make one last comment and then see the floor. I mean, what what concerns me about this is the same thing that concerned me back in May was that it's a blank check. So basically what I hear today is we want to we want to abate up to $1.5 million in rent for\nSpeaker 3: anybody. And then we want to abate up to three months rent from Spirit Alley and nonprofits. But you're not giving us a number on how much money that could be. And, you know, maybe we can get that before we vote.\nSpeaker 3: So because we're just voting on a blank check, in my opinion, and I'll see the floor now.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Brady. We're going to go to the vice mayor now because he can't stay.\nSpeaker 4: On the.\nSpeaker 1: Line too much longer. So Vice Mayor Knox White.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you very much. So I'm sure I mean, I have to leave in about 5 minutes. So I didn't think this is going to go on so long in general and run supportive of the staff proposal. I also am in support of it moving this forward and getting getting the idea that we were talking about this in\nSpeaker 6: May and it's now October and we still haven't helped out these businesses is the biggest provide for me out of everything. And so, you know, I worry that we're over complicating things a little bit, but I guess I also appreciate the concerns that are being raised.\nSpeaker 6: Like I don't want to be flippant, but with the public's money. You know, I'm not in the theater because my roadie mentioned, you know, I would quite honestly be willing to started. I had a year's worth of deferral rather than nine months.\nSpeaker 6: I just honestly, the idea that the movie theaters are going to be back sometime next year in a meaningful way is just crazy. And I do think that we keep incremental izing these things. And we're going to be back here in three months or four months having the same conversation, and it's going to be agonizing or whatever\nSpeaker 6: . Let's just call it theaters. We're not going to be back. I mean, he might be open and we're operating at ten or 25% occupancy and maybe holding on. But he's certainly not going to be running that theater at a level where where it's done.\nSpeaker 6: So I would like to at least give the city manager the authority, and I'm not sure I'm going to be here for the vote because I don't know, 5 minutes. But I would like to see the theater go for a for a maximum of 15 months.\nSpeaker 6: And then, you know, again, I just want to reiterate what I heard the city manager said, which is this is the beginning for all of these all of these businesses, the beginning conversation. It's not the final word. We're just trying to get some certainty there.\nSpeaker 6: And as long as you know, I would be very supportive of anything that just made it really clear that we're not going to come back and say, why are people asking us for more money in January when our, you know, our county and our city is have required them to be closed in the buildings that we have\nSpeaker 6: ? So those are my short term.\nSpeaker 5: Thinking behind.\nSpeaker 6: Trying to work as these very complicated and difficult.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. All right. So we haven't heard from Councilmember De Saag and and I haven't spoken. So before we go back to councilmembers who have spoken, let's hear from Councilmember Desai. Are you unmuted?\nSpeaker 6: Okay. One more time. Yeah. Quick question for the staff when it comes to the nine month rent deferral that's contemplated for the theater. Is there something special about nine months or could we conceivably do 12 months as vice mayor Knox White had mentioned?\nSpeaker 6: I mean, if it's just as well I mean, if there's nothing special about nine months and that we can do 12 months, I think I think the rationale that it presented is it probably applies here so we can get a.\nSpeaker 6: Response to that.\nSpeaker 4: Nine months. It takes us to the end of the year.\nSpeaker 6: Oh, okay. Well, that's all it is. It's just kind of this convenience thing. Okay. All right. Okay. No, I think the idea of 12 month rent deferral probably makes more sense, I think. So, you know, that's something that that I can certainly support.\nSpeaker 6: In terms of Alameda point, I think it's clear that the businesses there that we're talking about, they they've really made. They've really put Alameda point if not Alameda on the map. I mean every year of the Chronicle and perhaps with the assistance of the city of Alameda.\nSpeaker 6: But every year the Chronicle comes out with their city of Alameda insert touting businesses. And we all love how they always have those beautiful photographs of of the of St George's facility. I mean, so so they've really put us on the map and certainly rock wall has been an important part.\nSpeaker 6: But when I think of Rockwall, obviously I'm also going to think of Rosenblum Sellers from many years ago. So I'm very supportive of what staff is recommending. I think they've laid out a workable framework for assessing the businesses, whether with a $1.5 million conversion loan idea or with the rent deferral idea.\nSpeaker 6: I think we can work with that. It's very limited in its in its geographic scope, namely the Spirits Alley. And and for good reason. Like I said, the these areas, these businesses really have put us on the map.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, cheeses, you know, I just remember way back in the 1990s, you know, we were always grousing about, you know, work and work and, you know, young middle age adults have a fun place to hang out, you know, in the city of Alameda.\nSpeaker 6: Well, you know, lo and behold, you know, this the idea of Spirits Alley came about and a lot of businesses were were cropping up on their own. And I think we got to hold on to that. And it goes without saying, obviously, for the east and, you know, the what the theater has done for for Park Street\nSpeaker 6: , we all know that story. So so that so we don't have to rehash that. So I'm very supportive of what staff is outlining, and I'm confident that that staff can, when it comes to negotiating the rent deferrals and converting it to abatements, etc., I'm very confident that our staff can figure things out on our behalf.\nSpeaker 1: And this kind of.\nSpeaker 4: I'm so I'm council member Odie I have been diligently doing my math here to help.\nSpeaker 5: Out with.\nSpeaker 4: That. That total number would be for Spirits Alley and and nonprofits and I estimated to be about over a three year period of time. Potentially it would be $390,000.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So $10 a year.\nSpeaker 1: This is tell us what that represents again.\nSpeaker 4: Now, what I did was if we deferred three months rent of all of those guys, what's the what's that magnitude, the number that Councilmember Ody was asking for? And so it's about $390,000.\nSpeaker 6: And that's assuming that if and that would be a payment if they prepaid and only one year, right?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Thank you. It gives me much better comfort. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I'm getting this powder.\nSpeaker 0: And the only thing I wanted to add that if the council wanted to offer extended rent deferral to the theater, the only we would have to either come back with a second budget amendment to capture the additional funds we would need to make the 1 to 8 loan, or we would have to amend the resolution this evening\nSpeaker 0: . And I think we would probably want to come back separately with a resolution on any extended time so that we could calculate what that actual number is. But I just wanted to remind the council that there is a cost to the general fund to extending the time.\nSpeaker 6: See.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. So here's what I want to say. I'm going to start with Alan made a point. I think if I were in Alameda Point business listening to this discussion and I think a few of the business people from out there are listening, I might be rather dismayed.\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I think it's great that we want to be careful with the expenditure of our dollars, and I hope that cuts across the board. So our expenditure on all kinds of things. But stop and consider our Alameda Point businesses.\nSpeaker 1: They have been out there what I call the wild, wild west from the beginning. They have suffered through infrastructure that is World War Two era.\nSpeaker 0: Or.\nSpeaker 1: Earlier. I mean, it's getting better now, but that means they've lived with all the construction and everything that that brings, but they have lived with their power going out through water, going out, their telephones going out, and they still run businesses.\nSpeaker 1: Those were in the good times. And then we came to this pandemic and they are struggling as best they can and time is money. And I'm also pained that we have discussed this, as was noted back in April and May, and here we are in October still discussing it.\nSpeaker 1: So I, I think it's a reasonable amount of money and it's coming from the, the Alameda Point, the base reuse fund. And Ms.. McIntyre just gave us the you could call it the worst case scenario, but maybe you'd call it the best case scenario.\nSpeaker 1: Truly, if every business out there that gets one of these loans is able to repay it early, that says something about business recovery, and that'll come back to help us in other ways. But right now, the simple fact is none of us has that crystal ball and can see into the future, but we can be reasonably sure\nSpeaker 1: this that we're going to be dealing with the impacts of the pandemic. I don't see the federal government coming up with a stimulus package before the end of the year, does anyone else. And so we have to help our own sometimes.\nSpeaker 1: And so I think it's a reasonable risk that we're taking. I think it's an investment. Do I know exactly how it'll come out and that everyone will be able to pay back and in a reasonable amount of time?\nSpeaker 1: I don't. But I think these businesses have stretched themselves to operate and brought a lot of benefit. As Councilmember Days have noted to our city. I think this is the time we step up and help them survive a little longer into this this pandemic.\nSpeaker 1: You know, you've probably read the letters that were attached, but in the beginning people were doing better, but now they're getting to the end of their reserves. So I think this is the time when we need to step in with a lifeline on the theater.\nSpeaker 1: I do want it to be a rent deferral, not abatement, at least initially. We can always, you know, further down the road in time we could make changes, but I think we can ramp up gradually. Mr. Potter makes a good point that if we vote to approve the resolution and perhaps with the the amendment that the city\nSpeaker 1: manager suggested, whatever we do, I would like us to be able to move forward this evening rather than having to have this item come back again to the council and delayed that much longer getting. The assistance into the hands of the the folks who need it.\nSpeaker 1: And again, with the theater, it's helping us pay to learn the section. When we learn that if we defaults on, we lose CDBG funding and we don't want to do that. So let's see if we can't find a way to wrap this up tonight.\nSpeaker 1: I see Councilmember O'Dowd and Councilmember Vela in that order.\nSpeaker 3: So I'd like to make a motion, but the way to do it, to do two separate motions.\nSpeaker 1: The city attorney is shaking his head. No. All right.\nSpeaker 3: So I would like to authorize the city manager to negotiate and execute rent relief agreements with commercial tenants on city owned properties via the $1.5 million Loan Conversion Assistance Program and implement an Alameda Point nonprofit and separately business relief program in response to COVID 19 pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: And then if that number exceeds 400,000, come back. And then approve a budget amendment appropriate at 1.5 million and base reuse fund balance for the Alameda Point Theater Loan Conversion Assistance Program and 315 and General Fund to assist Alameda Theater and give staff direction to come back with possible extensions of that deferment.\nSpeaker 3: And I just say one thing. I mean, the vice mayor and I have been pushing, you know, at least twice or three times to increase the amount of grant money for our small businesses by 300,000 or 600,000. And that's been rejected.\nSpeaker 3: So, you know, we've been pretty strong about providing money to businesses. You know, whether or not, you know, we require a big ask like this to be delineated with the actual dollar amount, I think is different than, you know, our commitment to to our small businesses.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I'm somebody Counselor Avila.\nSpeaker 5: So I actually still had questions and I haven't made any comments yet. I only ask questions.\nSpeaker 1: I see. Can we see if we can do it a second so we can just. Well.\nSpeaker 5: I.\nSpeaker 1: I would like you to question answered before.\nSpeaker 5: So we did we did give a list of criteria before, but that was under a different cap of money. And so I'm just wondering if we could and the criteria were not provided with this. So I'm just wondering where it stands.\nSpeaker 5: I'm hearing that the staff is going to keep the same criteria. I know there was a question before and there was a question about the boundary of spirit. Sally, does that include the missions actions by the bay building?\nSpeaker 5: Does that include the the the catering company? I know we had had a also there was something in there about making sure that there wasn't any enrichment to folks that were elected officials within the city. So I'm just wondering where we stand on the criteria and if the criteria are going to be made public.\nSpeaker 4: Well, so I'm for the Spirits, Ali, and the nonprofit. I did not I did not suggest any criteria. And if the council wants to add some on there, if you want to roll the ones over from the loan conversion program, that's fine to you.\nSpeaker 4: I just thought that we should that the that the three the nine month three year program should be simple. But if you want to add those things on there, I'm perfectly open. I just didn't recommend them.\nSpeaker 5: I just well, I wanted it's really two separate questions I think is what I'm looking for is for the for the abatement portion of this. We did talk about a list of criteria, and I'm just wondering that was back in May.\nSpeaker 5: I'm just wondering if that list of criteria, how that's going to be applied, is that being made public or are the businesses being aware of it? What's the process for that? And then the.\nSpeaker 1: Second part, what is the application process?\nSpeaker 5: Right. What's the application process look like? And then for the for the Spirits Alley portion of it, the question is really, again, you said all of monarch. And so I'm just when you answer that, you said, are any of the distilleries and all that, but there's a lot of other things on Monarch.\nSpeaker 5: So I just want to clarify, every business on Monarch would qualify for that, or only the distilleries and nonprofits on Monarch. I'm pregnant.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I was asked to say that.\nSpeaker 4: Most of the businesses I'm monarch are public serving businesses, and we intentionally put them there for that reason. For example, the antiques fair and the auction, those are all public serving businesses that have been struck by the same restrictions that the that the distilleries, the breweries have had.\nSpeaker 4: So I would I would lump them in there regarding the criteria and restrictions that you had on the previous and the loan conversion program. Quite honestly, we didn't really receive applications from people who would be. There were a couple of things that greeted the public officials.\nSpeaker 4: And then the you didn't want people who received the small business, you didn't want double dipping. So there was there was one tenant who received the small business and that tenant was denied for further and they didn't meet the employment qualifications because again, you guys set the bar, you guys intentionally.\nSpeaker 4: The small business loans were for 25 and under employees and you said 25 and over for the loan conversion program. So it was already mutually exclusive. But again, we never we didn't receive any applications from people who would have been denied on the criteria that you guys set out.\nSpeaker 5: And so the criteria because it's listed, the three of these three criteria, I'll just put it out there for people that haven't seen it. It's in the staff report on page two, but those criteria will stand for the abatement.\nSpeaker 5: So they'll still be used for this $1.5 million abatement process.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, absolutely.\nSpeaker 5: And then Councilmember Ody had raised the question earlier about what is a tenant? Is that going to be added as a as an additional criteria?\nSpeaker 4: Well, I guess I'll have to figure out how we answer that, Amina.\nSpeaker 5: Because I'm also trying I'm also trying to understand the emotions relative to his question, which is really I guess, the question for the of the.\nSpeaker 1: Ocean City attorney shared, is there anything you can add to help help us move this along?\nSpeaker 6: I would definitely.\nSpeaker 1: I'll throw these things to him without any warning. And he's graciously I would.\nSpeaker 3: I was also similarly trying to understand the the limits of the emotion. And if my understanding is correct and it is that it's 1.5 million for General Alameda point rent relief, another 400,000 for Spirits Alley and nonprofits relief, and then another 315,000 for Alameda Theater relief.\nSpeaker 3: Essentially, Councilmember Ortiz motion adds the 400,000 limitation to the nonprofit and Spirituality Assistance Program, where the staff recommendation did not have a cap. I believe that's my understanding. And Councilmember Otis motion and please correct me if I understood incorrectly.\nSpeaker 1: So everybody.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah it was basically the staff recommendation with the caveat of the 400,000, which is a little over 390. So that's fine I hope. And then direction to bring back some extension on the deferral to the for the theater because this Potter said we shouldn't do that today.\nSpeaker 1: And I think in this party.\nSpeaker 0: And then just to clarify to Councilmember Bella's point about the definition of a tenant, I think we have said that the $1.5 million deferral loan forgiveness program, the promissory note, will be cross collateralized against the lease. So a tenant will have to have a lease by definition in terms of how that program works.\nSpeaker 0: And if and we may if we have the ability to cross collateralize against a long term license, then then that should work, too. It serves the same principle of how how we define. And so I think that that would be our working definition of a tenant.\nSpeaker 0: If you if we have the ability to cross collateralize that note with your lease, which is what we're saying we're going to do, then you're a tenant by virtue of that.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So I you know, I'm supportive of the motion. I did like the idea of having that the city manager put out about having potentially for the leases to come back as a lease amendment just because especially if it's going to be larger portions of of money.\nSpeaker 5: I don't want to leave that on the city manager. I think it does need to come back at least to be run by council for for approval.\nSpeaker 1: So, Kelly, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 5: No, no. So I'm just I'm just wondering if if we could clarify that with the maker of the motion and and.\nSpeaker 1: What I was going to ask you, Councilor Arabella, is could we do that as a council direction to staff and keep the motion clean?\nSpeaker 5: I'm fine with that as long as it's a clear directive.\nSpeaker 1: We should probably go back to the maker of the motion. But, Ms.. Potter, you want to throw in something?\nSpeaker 0: And then I think that staff completely sympathizes with the desire and issue around transparency. So I don't I would say that we may want to bring would you consider would council be amenable to perhaps a report out so that we are documenting and reporting?\nSpeaker 0: If we do it as a lease amendment that is by ordinance, it's a first reading. It's a second reading. It's 30 days time. And and I'm wondering if a report out would be something that could satisfy that council's desire for transparency and information, knowing that we've kept the two programs.\nSpeaker 1: And and tell us what would be in the report at this point, if.\nSpeaker 0: It would be essentially the deal, what the deal, you know, the deal structure, what that what the deal structure is.\nSpeaker 1: So we've made these agreements with these two tenants. Tell me the point. And these are the terms.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. And I think we would we may want to work with the city attorney about whether or not there's any kind of proprietary information that we might want to address. But to be as transparent as we can with with a report and with an update about the activity of the $1.5 million program.\nSpeaker 1: So let me and Councilor Rebecca, you are next. But let me just ask for the city attorney to weigh in on what Ms.. Potter just said about the reporting and transparency. Does that give you any cause for concern?\nSpeaker 3: I'm assuming what Ms.. Hunter's proposing is that is is that in the program, staff is proposing we're not making fundamental changes to the lease. We're simply engaging in deferment and forgiveness. The lease remains the same. So if that is the program staff is proposing ultimately, which we're deferring and then forgiving, but not making the fundamental changes to\nSpeaker 3: the underlying lease, then council could delegate that authority to the city manager. But if we're making fundamental changes to the substance of the lease for some reason, then we need to bring that to the Council for your approval.\nSpeaker 3: I think that's sort of where the limitation is, is that you can delegate to staff, to defer and to forgive money. But if we're changing the lease structure, council has to vote to approve by ordinance.\nSpeaker 1: And what about the reporting out of details of the transaction?\nSpeaker 3: I think as soon as the city executes an agreement, then that agreement becomes a public record. So every part of that is public information, whether it's executed because the city manager did so with more delegation of authority or if the council did it in open session.\nSpeaker 3: Either way.\nSpeaker 6: The totality of that agreement has to be a public record.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Back to you, Mr. Clark.\nSpeaker 5: So I would be fine with that, except for anything over six figures for one individual tenant, or if we could break it down because 1.5 million, let's say we give forgiveness for. I guess my concern is I don't want to get a letter or email from from a tenant saying, you know, I was denied.\nSpeaker 5: But this other this other tenant got, you know, all of their rent deferred. And it was this huge portion of that. And there was a read out and there was no approval. We didn't renegotiate anything. So is there is there like a or even I'd even be fine with one point or 150 up to 150,000, which.\nSpeaker 5: Is 10% of the 1.5 million.\nSpeaker 0: I. But I think every.\nSpeaker 5: Sorry. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 0: I believe that every every applicant that we're looking at, the net rate is over 150,000, correct? That's correct. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: So but in terms of forgiveness. Like, I think it's one thing to defer over 150,000, but everyone's looking at over 150,004 in a grant.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. If you recall from the beginning tation that if you're right, if you're if one month's rent is $60,000 and you ask for two months of of abatement, you're at 120,000 right there on two months of rent. So we're talking about that's been some of the challenge with this is that we are talking about large, large monthly\nSpeaker 0: rents and large monthly obligations. So perhaps to address your concern, though, a capital letter scenario, as I was just going to say, perhaps 350,000, you know, maybe for if an abatement is going to be more than 350,000, we would bring it back.\nSpeaker 5: I guess my question is because on page three of your report, it says that the buildings at Alameda Point are large, the average is 20,000. The larger buildings range from 30000 to 64000 per month. So I guess I'm just trying to understand.\nSpeaker 5: And you're saying now that that all of them that are asking for this are on the 60,000 range. So none of them are on the 30,000 range.\nSpeaker 4: Now. Some of them are on the 30,000 range. When we talk about the average, you have to think we're also averaging the smaller tenants, like the caterer, like the kale, dry kale. I mean, those are like $6,000 and $7,000 a month.\nSpeaker 4: And so when you add those in and then you also have buildings but that are split, you have products, you have a hanger, one and faction and a split building. And so those rents are lower than like a larger building like Saint George Spirits or Rockwall.\nSpeaker 4: So when we say the average is 20 to 30, that is the average. But there are there are tenants that are $60,000.\nSpeaker 1: So would it be city manager I think wants to add some enlightenment, I hope. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Well, hopefully I agree with you.\nSpeaker 1: No pressure.\nSpeaker 6: But I would go back to that if you go with your motion. But you say if it's forgiveness, that the forgiveness would have to come back as a lease amendment to the council. I just get really concerned. So the deferral, the agreement, all that could be done through this motion benefit.\nSpeaker 6: If the company negotiates a lease, forgive or forgiveness, then that the final deal on that part would come back as a lease amendment to the council. I'd recommend that. I think it gets too confusing. You have a variety of issues because that would be considered bad debt.\nSpeaker 6: There's those issues. I'd rather just come as a lease amendment than it clears clears it for that for the company to.\nSpeaker 1: So you're saying to come back as the lease amendment if it was over a certain dollar amount?\nSpeaker 6: No. If it was forgiveness, if they were asking. If they were asking forgiveness.\nSpeaker 1: Of any amount.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. And Evans raising his hand.\nSpeaker 1: I can see that. I get the screen. Yeah. City attorney.\nSpeaker 6: I want to.\nSpeaker 3: Support the city manager's request. I think the way he's making the suggestion is more legally sound.\nSpeaker 1: It gets legally sound, that's for sure. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: But if you gave the city manager the right to forgive, what ends up happening is that that's just bad debt that essentially he's authorized to not collect, that we're not I mean, if it's doable, but it's it's more complicated and more messy, the city manager's recommendation is much legally cleaner.\nSpeaker 3: And so I just want to echo his recommendation is one that I find to be to be the better legal approach.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Council member. Got to see you nodding your head. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: You're that comportment that that was. That's exactly what my concern is. I think in the long run, I understand wanting to help the businesses. I just want to make sure that we don't get ourselves into a bind.\nSpeaker 1: We have to be realistic. Yeah. Okay. And so then Councilmember Odie is the maker of the motion.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I mean, I. I appreciate that as well, because my worry is that, you know, five large ones will take all of that money and then, you know, some of these smaller caterers, you know, slash, you know, whatever, you know, there are one or 2000 a month.\nSpeaker 3: You know, they're not going to be anything left over. So I'm happy with with amending the motion to include that requirement. Do I need to restate it.\nSpeaker 1: Madam Clerk?\nSpeaker 2: I think we can, you know, from from the amendment being accepted, I think I think we'll get it in the record down clearly.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So all I need.\nSpeaker 5: Is a second. All right. And second, by second.\nSpeaker 1: Is there any further discussion seeing? Then maybe we have a roll call vote with.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember de sac.\nSpeaker 6: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: By Fred Knox. Light is absent. Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 2: Vela. My mayor as he Ashcraft High that carries by four eyes.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Staff and city attorney and city manager. This is I mean, it's complicated. We're kind of learning as we go and trying to, you know, do our best.\nSpeaker 0: Work.\nSpeaker 1: And in an ever changing situation. And so so thank you for what you've done. But it just makes me feel better that we can move forward and start getting this these funds out to help prop our businesses up.\nSpeaker 1: And in the meantime, I want everybody who's listening to be wear your masks every time you walk out the door. I don't care what you're hearing on a national level here. You're hearing it from me. This is the way we're going to get past COVID and get our businesses back and business and our kids back to school\nSpeaker 1: . So thank you all for for a great effort. All right. So that and item six D and then we move on to city manager communication that you need to be fully communicative. Mr. Leppard Yeah, but we've got that.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: District seven. My District eight. By District nine. Motion is carried.\nSpeaker 2: Fantastic. Onward to 27.\nSpeaker 1: Please report from Parks, Recreation and Marine recommendation to receive a report and adopt the proposed Parks Recreation and Marine Department Strategic Plan 2022 to 2032 citywide.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Let's go ahead to the staff report.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. I will turn it over to Brant, Dennis and Meredith Reynolds for a staff report. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Modica. Good evening, Vice Mayor. Members of City Council. Served three years of engaging, listening and learning. We're honored to present the final parks, make Long Beach the prime strategic plan this evening. This is an effort that's been informed by a considerable number of partners and stakeholders.\nSpeaker 2: And despite being interrupted by a pandemic, this provided a unique opportunity to reexamine the important role of parks in community resiliency and recovery. Next slide, please. The plan guides operational staffing and budgeting decisions for the department over the next ten years.\nSpeaker 2: This plan contains goals, outcomes and actions for how the department prioritizes our work, how we organize our staff, how we decide where to invest, and how we partner with our community with equity as an overarching theme. A department strategic plan is different than a park system's master plan or a plan that addresses the types of programing for\nSpeaker 2: a particular user group. Although these are important and are referenced in the plan, I'll now turn it over to Park Planning and Partnerships Bureau Manager Nancy Bates. And you're and Deputy City Manager Meredith Reynolds, who had served in that capacity before moving to the city manager's office.\nSpeaker 2: They'll be co-presenting tonight's brief presentation. Next slide, please.\nSpeaker 3: So just to provide you a little bit of information of what's in the plan, the strategic plan is to organized, to provide a history of our community and a context for our department in the past, present and future.\nSpeaker 3: We then focus on the community's feedback, which contributed towards our statement of possibility and values, which we'll get to in a few fights. And lastly, the plan outlines eight goals that will help us achieve our statement of possibility.\nSpeaker 3: Next slide, please. So we have a lot to be proud of as a department and as a city. Just to give you an example, out of the 100 most populous cities in the country, we ranked 31st in that Trust for Public Land Park Score Index, which is a pretty significant accomplishment.\nSpeaker 3: But at the same time, we have a long way to go when it comes to Parks to Park Equity, while we have 6.6 acres of parks per 1000 residents in our city. We know that the ratio is much lower for central, west and north Long Beach, where there's a combination of of a few things where you have\nSpeaker 3: fewer and smaller parks and also high density neighborhoods. This is why equity is such a strong theme that's woven throughout our our strategic plan. Next slide, please. I'll turn this over to Meredith. Thank you. From the beginning, the park's community engagement effort was grounded in best practices, was planned to be accessible and inclusive and centered community voice\nSpeaker 3: . And what began with a very personal approach with in-person outreach at park events in the summer of 2019, became a full pivot to curated virtual engagements after a period of hiatus, while staff was reassigned to support the city's pandemic response in all, the department and engagement efforts connected to close to 400 community groups had over 1600 people\nSpeaker 3: take our survey. We deployed posters and service stations at community centers and promoted surveys and listening sessions on social media. We even had a strategic plan engagement band visit over 30 community events. And all of this was done in the city's four languages to maximize language access.\nSpeaker 3: Next slide, please. In the virtual space, we collected surveys and park stories in multiple languages. We had our user groups data and dedicated listening sessions where we shared progress with opportunities for feedback on draft goals and objectives. We engaged in various social media outlets and connected with trusted community partners, asking them to share the opportunity to participate\nSpeaker 3: in their specific networks. We also recognize that many staff still face a digital divide and divide as creative ways for community members to engage from a safe distance. We added lawn signs with QR codes that connected visitors to online engagement tools while they were safely visiting parks.\nSpeaker 3: We set up cardboard service stations at learning hubs to reach those who visited these spaces. We produced a Part Stories podcast series featuring some of the department's partners and city staff to share how our department plans partners and produces programing and manages our operations.\nSpeaker 3: And we engage the Parks and Recreation Commission on several instances to share drafts of our progress. Next slide, please. As a considerable amount of planning went into creating an intentional and meaningful engagement process and participant experience, which was intended to cast a wide net in a way that anyone could feel included, heard and valued.\nSpeaker 3: This process also had a series of opportunities for input, but participation from department staff who are experts in their field, as well as opportunities for leadership of the department to explore strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We acknowledge that the interruption of the pandemic had a significant impact on our best laid plans for in-person engagement during the pandemic\nSpeaker 3: . The engagement process was considerably augmented out of an abundance of caution for people's safety, and we instead shifted to virtual spaces to listen and engage. This engagement process provided our team with the opportunity to reengage with those we've had relationships with for many years, to reduce our re-introduce ourselves to those we have limited contact with, and to\nSpeaker 3: establish connections with those who were new to us. Each of these instances was an opportunity to demonstrate the value of the community's knowledge, and we took each interaction as an opportunity to build trust with these partners. Next slide, please.\nSpeaker 3: Our process included consulting, consulting other adopted city planners to ensure the goals in these other arenas of city work were incorporated. We know that land use, mobility, climate action, housing, digital inclusion, youth, seniors, animals and racial equity are all interconnected and there are intersectional aspects of all of our work.\nSpeaker 3: Our process also included researching best practices for similar efforts across the country and from coast to coast. Our pure organizations are engaged in impactful work that we learned from and were able to infuse this learning in the plan.\nSpeaker 3: Many of these plans had a strong, inclusive community engagement effort, centered equity and community voice, and called for strong support. A partner systems to address issues like climate change, support, mental and physical health and result in greater park equity.\nSpeaker 3: Next slide, please. In March 2020, when the first cases of COVID were present in Long Beach, Park, staff roles pivoted to shutting down operations at the city's 167 parks and shifted to new operational models. Our parks and open spaces were never so appreciated or heavily used because of the pandemic.\nSpeaker 3: And while many other places were closed, our parks remain open. Our park and beach maintenance teams devise new parks and beach sanitizing schedules. Signage was placed and replaced, communicating the ever changing COVID guidelines. Our community ambassadors were deployed for the safe use of parks.\nSpeaker 3: Virtual programing was developed to shift programing online, and our learning hubs provided a safe and free learning space to complete distance learning. Hundreds of staff shifted to work from home schedules or deployed to support other city departments, including standing up and staffing shelters, operating vaccination clinics, eating and contact tracing, and even developing the city's COVID testing program\nSpeaker 3: . During one of the city's most pressing emergencies, department staff met the moment being versatile, resilient and capable of supporting the community when they needed it most. Next slide, please, and I'll turn it back to Nancy. So not too long ago, the city council approved one time dollars dollars towards park maintenance.\nSpeaker 3: And those dollars were very much needed. But in the long term, we really do need structural dollars to properly maintain our parks at a level that the community expects and deserves. And as you can see from this chart, we fall short compared to the statewide dollars available per acre in terms of park maintenance.\nSpeaker 3: Also want to add that park maintenance was a very high on the list of concerns and feedback that we received from our residents. Next slide, please. So in addition to the rounds of surgeries that Meredith outlined, we went back one more time after we prepared the draft strategic plan to collect one more round of surveys in the\nSpeaker 3: four languages. And we collected close to 70 responses at that time, and this helped us further refine the strategic plan. And I also want to add that we continue to hear feedback on our strategic plan, and I would encourage residents to continue to reach out to us with whatever questions and comments that they have.\nSpeaker 3: Even if the plan is adopted tonight, it doesn't mean that we stop listening to the needs and concerns of our residents and visitors to our city. Next slide, please. Now, speaking of our statement of possibility, it is that we make our parks and beaches safe, welcoming spaces for our residents and visitors.\nSpeaker 3: Putting people at the center of all we do, including our park users, partners and team members to creative to create inclusive, enriching, healthy communities for all to thrive. And this is something that we've really developed from all the outreach efforts that were described in our presentation.\nSpeaker 3: And these are based on very specific values that include being effective, thoughtful, transparent, resilient, collaborative, respectful and nurturing among other values. Next slide, please. So the strategic plan itself is organized into.\nSpeaker 0: Eight goals, with.\nSpeaker 3: 24 outcomes that yield 160 action items that are based on what we heard from the Community Stakeholders, survey respondents and also Parks, Recreation and Marine staff. Next find. While you can view all the full details of the plan in the plan itself.\nSpeaker 3: For anyone listening, just wanted to outline what those are. And our first goal is to provide safe, accessible public spaces, while our second goal is to offer meaningful recreational programing and events. Third, we have prioritized health equity across the city.\nSpeaker 3: Next slide, please. We also want to build innovating and lasting relationships. That's our fourth goal. And fifth, we have connect internally with the community clearly and transparently. Our sixth goal is to establish an environmentally sustainable park ecosystem. Next slide, please.\nSpeaker 3: And seventh, we have ensured a diverse and dynamic workforce. And lastly, we have as our goal, to create a financially secure and resilient operation. Next slide, please. And with then with this, I will turn it over to Director Denis.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, Nancy and Meredith. I'm very pleased on the efficiency that you walk through with very extensive strategic plan. I do want to share that our next steps in implementing the strategic plan will involve breaking down the outcomes and strategies into short, medium and long term phases that can be implemented over the next decade, starting\nSpeaker 2: with this current year. We will report to our Parks and Recreation Commission on an annual basis. With that, I want to thank the Commission for their ongoing support throughout the plans, development and their future support as we move into the implementation phase.\nSpeaker 2: I also want to thank the staff and all the community members who got us to where we are today and also City Fabric, who was our consultant on this project. This concludes our presentation and we welcome any questions or comments that you may have at this time.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you very much. All right. Thank you, Brant and Nancy and Meredith. We're going to go to public comment first before we go to council comment.\nSpeaker 4: Our first speaker is Denise Bernard Yearwood.\nSpeaker 0: Hi.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening right there. I'm a resident of Buffalo and I saw the report we on the west side of me, three or four plans and I have the report. So in regards to this, I believe the government underestimated the funds they needed to acquire additional hardware.\nSpeaker 3: So I.\nSpeaker 0: Think that means more and.\nSpeaker 3: More participating see as the benefit of the physical.\nSpeaker 0: And mental health of the president. So I.\nSpeaker 3: Think by allowing lands along the river as he developed for.\nSpeaker 0: Moving his facility.\nSpeaker 3: Possibly further statement, support for settling.\nSpeaker 0: In for air as proposed by the City Park Coalition. Do we.\nSpeaker 3: Consider developing the.\nSpeaker 0: Complex at 37 to 1 along the river?\nSpeaker 3: I've read their statement that using grant funds where the land and I believe.\nSpeaker 0: There is a platform, there.\nSpeaker 3: Are plans.\nSpeaker 0: For the L.A. River basin. So I.\nSpeaker 3: Strongly urge you to amend the plans.\nSpeaker 0: By.\nSpeaker 4: Our next speaker is an Cantrell.\nSpeaker 3: But evening in Cantrell.\nSpeaker 0: Speaking for the River Park Coalition, this document makes clear that Long Beach needs to budget more funds for maintenance and acquisition of Parkland. River Park Coalition agrees with the goal goals. Quote Every Long Beach resident has walkable and bikeable access to a neighborhood park and established park equity acquisition guidelines for securing land, for developing new parks and\nSpeaker 0: open spaces in park poor communities, unquote. River Park Coalition would like to suggest this solution for acquiring park land on the L.A. River. The city should settle the Civic Place, Sequoia lawsuit and do an environmental impact report with the alternative river.\nSpeaker 0: Using this land is park land purchased the land from the owners using grants. This will help fulfill several of the strategic plan goals. Add more parkland in a park deprived area and as this is pongal land, fulfill the goal to amplify and degenerate people, cultural practices.\nSpeaker 2: And.\nSpeaker 0: Connections to the land. This park would be an ideal opportunity to educate on the history and connection of Indigenous people to Long Beach. I urge you to take this last opportunity to obtain this property. Parkland. I'd also like to add that to make Parks safer, I would urge you to bring back the Rangers.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Our next speaker is Anna Christianson.\nSpeaker 0: Unmuted.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. You're on mute.\nSpeaker 0: Hello.\nSpeaker 4: We can hear you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. This is from the lawsuit of Weapons Task Force Sierra Club. Re Indigenous peoples acknowledge the Hodgeman tribe, not only the Tongva as indigenous to Long Beach as they share the Territory, act as caretakers and vendors of the land and waters and regard football as their sacred site.\nSpeaker 0: Acknowledge that Long Beach is now also home to tribal peoples from throughout the United States and North Central and South America, as well as the Pacific Islands, knowledge that the sacred sites above that includes the lows through those wetlands, a knowledge that from a tribal perspective, taking care of the land means ensuring that it can support life\nSpeaker 0: for future generations to come. Not only humans, but the whole web of life return parklands to our high human tribe, at least some of them, and enter into management agreements with these entities. Acquire tribal, cultural and burial sites within the city and preserve them as natural spaces, place known sites on city property into open spaces and parklands\nSpeaker 0: . We climate change. Do not add or expand paved areas, buildings, artificial turf, playing fields, plastic grass, seawalls, or the port of Long Beach under open land and waters in the Highlands area or coastal zone communities subject to inundation due to sea level rise.\nSpeaker 0: Do not add more concession stands re bit venues at the expense of open space repair. The Belmont Pier Re equity prioritize acquiring land and making park improvements in underserved communities. DeLay or deny new projects located in overserved communities until park equity goals have been met.\nSpeaker 0: Teach everybody to swim for free. Do not rely on the U.S. pools for the general public's use for wildlife and bird. Appear to prioritize making habitat for birds and wildlife in park maintenance and acquisition plans, including along the L.A. and San Gabriel River and in the Lower Cerritos wetlands.\nSpeaker 0: Folk don't focus only on public access and recreational opportunities, utilizing concessions, especially vet fees for revenue streams or maintaining marine infrastructure and services to maintain boats which focus on the entire ecosystem. Plant trees and groundcover that supports birds and wildlife.\nSpeaker 0: Reestablish native species. Don't keep trimming trees every single year, erasing wildlife and bird habitats. Don't permit fireworks shows that pollute air and water to harm marine life and disrupt nesting birds, causing them to abandon their nests. Don't use herbicides to maintain parks, marinas or green belt and don't support restoration projects that erase and replace existing wetlands and\nSpeaker 0: tribal areas like the LC plan for the Lowe's to be those wetlands we go carting your employees. Please do finally provide your 450 part time seasonal employees with health benefits, including paid maternity leave. So thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Our next speaker is Roger Martin Holman. Our next speaker is David Hall.\nSpeaker 2: Hi, this is David Hall. Well, Motor City members of the council, I do support the Parks Recreation Marine Strategic Plan. I think it goes far in addressing the lack of our parkland in West Long Beach and downtown Long Beach and along the Los Angeles River.\nSpeaker 2: I think that parks benefit everybody in the community and we really need parks not only for the youth, but for others, for recreation. We also need parks to improve the air quality, especially in the park communities. You know, what's interesting, I think, is that Councilman Richard Richardson, in the background, you have Martin Luther King.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that's great because the city manager did a report a year ago for the City Council on Parks across Long Beach, and the inequality of Parkland dates back to the days of segregation. And I think the disparity in Parkland needs to be addressed, and I think we need to remedy it.\nSpeaker 2: And I really think this strategic plan will go far in correcting this injustice and bringing parks to the people who need it on the West Side and in our park communities. So thank you very much to the Park Department.\nSpeaker 2: Great job and I encourage you to support this plan. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Our next speaker is David Sonata. Your time begins now.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, counsel. My name is Davids and I have the honor to serve as the chair of the Long Beach Parks, Recreation and Marine Department. Tonight, along with my fellow commissioners and staff, we are excited to present support with comments and act on our city's long awaited strategic plan that will lead us forward as a city.\nSpeaker 2: The Commission applauds the hard work and commitment staff has provided in working with and listening to our city's neighborhoods, underserved communities, and partnering with all departments of the city in keeping park equity open and open space in the forefront while maintaining our high quality of life, safety and healthy choices throughout our park system.\nSpeaker 2: With that said, our outcomes from this plan will not allow for the status quo. It is imperative we work with our communities to improve upon facilities and programs and serve our public to the best of our ability. This is a lot to unpack in this plan, but it has been 20 plus years since Council last received a\nSpeaker 2: strategic plan for our Parks Department and is needed to continue to maintain and build on park equity, improve our focus on maintenance of our parks, and continue to provide valued programing and open space with our partners in the communities across the city.\nSpeaker 2: The importance of our park and beach system and its services show where the public lived during these challenges. Challenging times of pandemic. Parks and beaches are where the public enjoyed family or family open space, mental health and programs for all ages.\nSpeaker 2: While the department keeps us safe, sane, healthy throughout our day, this is an asset we cannot ignore. At present, we are below the local and national average cost per acre for maintenance of park operations. Maintenance must continually be addressed by council and take a turn toward increased funding and council support to protect one of the city's largest\nSpeaker 2: assets. With 33,125 acres and 167 parks. In our system, we stand tall as a diverse city. Who knows the importance in providing park and beach access equally to all our citizens and programs of education of value to all ages.\nSpeaker 2: Tonight, together with my fellow commissioners and the PRM staff, we ask each of you to embrace this roadmap and collectively ask you to receive an app, not just file on the goals and objectives this strategic plan provides with equity and maintenance as top priorities.\nSpeaker 2: We ask you in your monthly meetings with director Dennis and during the budget process to invest in our neighborhoods and communities, address the inequities that continue to exist in our city, and work toward improving additional funding and available grants for maintenance to improve our park and marine facilities.\nSpeaker 2: Let's keep our park system up to the standards our city deserves. We respectfully ask the Council to support, discuss and approve this new and engaged strategic plan and receive and continue to act on its content moving forward. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 2: Go.\nSpeaker 4: Our final speaker is Roger Martin Holman.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you very much. Can you hear me okay?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, we can hear you.\nSpeaker 2: Great. Thank you so much. And thank you, Vice Mayor and members of the city council for hearing us tonight and for your attention to this. I'd like to state that I'm here to align my self with the comments by Ms..\nSpeaker 2: And Control that were made earlier, and also to speak to the total imbalance of Park Space in Long Beach, West Side, specifically, because that's where I live for among other reasons. But we get the worst of port pollution, perhaps with the exception of downtown, and we have very, very little parking space per resident.\nSpeaker 2: And we. And we're sitting here while space that is the last possible opportunity for getting more open park SpaceX is on a chopping block and it's really disheartening and frustrating and I'm hoping the city council can do something.\nSpeaker 2: But again, I would just like to say that the remarks in this country are certainly important. And thank you all.\nSpeaker 4: That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 2: All right, thank you. I'll take you back behind the rail. I did offer some brief comments and we have a long list of council speakers. But thanks to everyone who spoke on public comment and all the hundreds of residents participated in this process over the last, you know, over the last couple of years.\nSpeaker 2: And thanks to that, I think, you know, it's noticeable to me what your values are through this presentation and this report. I think, you know, I think it's, you know, strategic plans are important. They help to institutionalize, you know, the values and the strategy so that every time a leader comes in, a new staff member comes in\nSpeaker 2: and the council member comes in, there's always something to work with. You have a general idea of where the organization is heading in part, you know, incredibly important, you know, to the community members and council members. I think what happened was, you know, what happened when we transitioned Highland Park, you know, made more investments into more of\nSpeaker 2: a regional center with, you know, senior programing youth program. Health programing makes a big difference. And I know that's incredibly important to a lot of folks. I also know that over the years, you know, I've heard things from some staff and others.\nSpeaker 2: When you raise issues like this, there's a big disparity in parks and open space. I've heard things like, hey, you know, we have a, you know, a quiet moratorium on new parks because we don't have money to maintain them.\nSpeaker 2: I understand the maintenance issue. We certainly have to do that. But I like this plan, this plant and doesn't hide it. They say right out the gate, we have a problem in north central west Long Beach. Here's what it looks like and it attributed to to history.\nSpeaker 2: Like the last person who spoke talked about the history. All of these decisions were human decisions, you know, based on land use, where freeways are built, you know, what zoning looks like, land use, all of that created the disparity that we have today.\nSpeaker 2: So I believe that strategic planning, you know, things, general plans, all of those things are mechanisms that can be used to sort of right the wrongs of the past and help chart a more inclusive future. So from this standpoint, I like that this plan leans into equity and doesn't hide from and so so I want to thank\nSpeaker 2: staff. There's there's obviously a lot here. I got a chance to peruse it but I got to spend more time with the strategic plan. But from what I see, I think, you know, if we go after, you know, what's called out as the sort of larger vision statement instead of only goals, we can make a real difference\nSpeaker 2: . So those are my general thoughts on the plan. Our first person cued up is Councilwoman Sara.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. Just to add to what you shared, I want to thank Brant, Meredith and Nancy, as well as all of the PR and staff and all those involved with getting the strategic plan together in the past three year.\nSpeaker 3: I know it's been a challenge doing the community engagement during the pandemic, especially when you're trying to get them out in multiple languages in the midst of the pandemic. And I just also want to appreciate that equity was mentioned as that being central as part of this plan, and that I think it's really important that we think\nSpeaker 3: about it in addition to the climate change issue, that's also crucial. Prime is also a crucial partner. And in addition to our Health and Human Services Department in violence prevention and strengthening our neighborhood in our community. So I had a chance to read through it and appreciate the way the goals and the outcomes are aligned.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that is a good way for us to provide guidance in the way that we can move towards all the goals. And also for me, I look towards how do we ensure equity in all of the parks in central Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: And I appreciate, I think that we've already started implementing or using that as a guide to doing to helping to improve our parks from Brent's leadership and improving communications to Senator Lena Gonzales, ensuring that their state funding, as well as our other legislator that ensure that there's investment into our parks.\nSpeaker 3: So with that said, I wanted to ask a few question and I would make one observation in that with that equity being central to, I think, the framework for this report, I think it's also interesting the number, the demographic of those who filled out the survey.\nSpeaker 3: So I'll speak to page 135, which the question part 25, it's question 35, which is how much total combined money that all members of your household earn in 2018. And over 50% came from the $100,000 or more income level, while less tend to less.\nSpeaker 3: I will say 10% or less are $99,999 income level or less. And so my question is when how could we have done better to ensure we had more equitable response from across our different community members and how? And then the second is, how do we ensure that while we have a predominantly number of certain kind of people\nSpeaker 3: filling out the survey, that it's at least equitably inform how this report was written? Those are my two questions. I want to add a third, but I will wait to see if I have to queue up.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, well, thank you. Council ministers Brant. So I do appreciate your your question. And I know there were a lot of factors at the mid-point in our outreach and I realize that when we had attempted to bring this strategic plan for accounts.\nSpeaker 2: So last July for a variety of reasons, I think for the best reasons, we did have a numerous months to work with all nine of the council offices to really look at avenues or ways that we could reach all corners of the community.\nSpeaker 2: So I do want to credit a lot of the messaging and cooperation with all of the council offices that I think we did glean a lot of input from many of the community members that early on, you know, even the digital divide.\nSpeaker 2: I think when we relied a lot on electronic surveys, that that was an obstacle for many. But I also know that through a lot of our stakeholder groups and focus groups that had representations of a lot of the corners of the community, the senior community and youth, that those were reflected in a lot of the goals and\nSpeaker 2: the values that were generated. It's just that in those circumstances it wasn't as easy to capture, I guess, the family household income levels, although I do feel confident that a lot of those voices were clearly heard by representatives within a lot of those stakeholder groups.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Do I have time to ask one more question? This will be my last question. Or should I queue up again because there's no timer? And I'll just ask you really quick is how can we ensure what's the process to getting ongoing feedback?\nSpeaker 3: I think Nancy shared earlier that we're able to our community members are able to like is that in an email process or is that just call? And Nancy, how do we make sure there's ongoing feedback even though we have a strategic plan now?\nSpeaker 2: That's that's the next one. This is brand again. So I think on our website and this is our commitment to the Parks and Recreation Commission that we'll be assembling, you know, an annual report on really a daily if not weekly basis.\nSpeaker 2: So I think most likely on our website, we'll make sure there's a link for continued dialog and input from the community because this will be a work in progress for lots of obvious reasons. And I think, you know, two or three years ago kind of the nature of how the strategic plan was developing certainly took a whole\nSpeaker 2: different approach as we were reimagining our own programing and our own operations because of the pandemic. And I think since we're not out of that yet, you know, as we enter into the new normal, I think we're going to find a lot of new approaches and a new ideas.\nSpeaker 2: I know even within the past year, we've had a lot of newer interest in some of our recreational aspects of what we do. There's been a voice for rugby and pickleball. There's a new sport called Tech Ball. Our seniors want to be more active and we really have to be very cognizant of the health protocols, but also\nSpeaker 2: think about ways that we can keep people healthy and that so we'll be open to, you know, a lot of the new trends and a lot of the opportunities. But I think our department has always prided itself in being a good listener to the community and really, you know, all nine council offices, as we've learned from month\nSpeaker 2: to month, have been the best, the best venue, our best liaison connection to a lot of residents who really care about the importance of parks and recreation, to build a healthy community and all those great qualities of life that make Long Beach attractive.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you so much, friend.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. All right. Thank you. Yes, that was a very long 5 minutes. Next, Councilman Austin. Thank you. And, you know, there's a lot of good content going on here and a lot of good comments and good questions.\nSpeaker 2: And so I want to just first say that Parks really do make our city, they make Long Beach. And this strategic plan is very impressive to me on many levels. I want to thank our staff for their hard work with the Parks Recreation Marine Commissioners.\nSpeaker 2: But more importantly, I want to thank the community who participated in this engagement process, which I think should be really uplifted and saluted for all of the work that has gone into this. No other department in our city is equipped to do this type of engagement, in my opinion, like Parks and Recreation.\nSpeaker 2: And so they have the the the access and the day to day interaction with so many folks in our city and a very, very diverse and representative diversity in every, every way. I think this strategic plan, it really helps to define our mission that comes to our parks and rec parks for the next several years.\nSpeaker 2: In the end, it will help us create new opportunities for programing and access across the city. With with equity as the foundation comes to mind. And I'm really, really impressed with that. I'm glad to see that there was some emphasis on maintenance, because I know that that is an issue that my constituents care deeply about.\nSpeaker 2: We do have great parks. We should look at our parks as assets in care for those assets. And so to the extent we can budget and plan more resources to go toward maintenance, I think that's that's a that's something that we as a council need to take on and deliver for for the city.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, there was considerable public comment related to park equity and in acquiring more park space. I just wanted to say, I know this council and my office working with our state legislators and really with our county board of supervisors, Janice Hahn, we were able to secure 11 acres along the river that will be dedicated for\nSpeaker 2: park space. And I want to make sure that that is you know, that's not missed here. That's not a missed opportunity here. That is, and $3 million from the state of California to help with the planning and development of that space.\nSpeaker 2: So that is that significant progress that we shouldn't overlook in as we move forward. Again, I really just want to salute the engagement process here. The time that has gone into getting this. This is a three years process.\nSpeaker 2: And to park and rec directors move on. The staff that had anything to do with this this great document. And it's something that we can definitely build on for years to come. Thanks. Right. Thank you. Before we go to the next one, madam.\nSpeaker 2: It seems like a few people that queued up either weren't recognized. So after we get done with this, I just want to let folks know I'm going to go back. If you can identify that list when we're done, we're going to bring them up so that they can see.\nSpeaker 2: You understand that? Madam Court.\nSpeaker 1: So the individuals who have their hand raised currently, you'd like to call on them after the comments from the council?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I get it. We've changed our format a little bit today, so some folks didn't have the rules. Let's just make sure that they're ready. You can cut off the secret list now, but those people who have their hands raised in queue, please make sure that they get a chance after we're done with this for deliberations when\nSpeaker 2: we vote. Okay. Next, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you very much. So a couple of things. First of all, a huge thanks to our Prem staff for the presentation tonight. And Meredith, it was nice to have you back for your guest appearance tonight and our Parks and Rec commissioners for all of their participation in this process.\nSpeaker 0: I think it's been really great.\nSpeaker 3: There's a couple of things. So in looking at the priorities, I mean, I think. It's really disheartening to see.\nSpeaker 0: That our maintenance budget is below what the national standard is.\nSpeaker 3: That's really disappointing to me because I think having safe and clean parks should be a core function of the city.\nSpeaker 0: And so I think it's.\nSpeaker 3: Important for us to to figure out I mean, when I looked.\nSpeaker 0: At the priorities that were listed in the report.\nSpeaker 3: Maintaining an efficient.\nSpeaker 0: And fiscally sustainable budget, or I forget which words were used was really like the last priority.\nSpeaker 3: I think we should figure out how much money it's going to take to create safe park spaces and maintain them.\nSpeaker 0: And that that that fiscal responsibility for that effort for the city should really be a lot.\nSpeaker 3: Higher up, in my opinion, because if we can't afford to maintain the parks and have safe parks.\nSpeaker 0: We're really not utilizing that space and allowing it to be utilized by residents in the way that it should be. So I really want to.\nSpeaker 3: Talk about that.\nSpeaker 0: Priority as being an important one. We want to make sure that our residents are feeling safe in going to the park. I think.\nSpeaker 3: Programing, I mean, when we're talking about concepts.\nSpeaker 0: Of equity and access programing is really, really important, especially for our youth, but also for our seniors. I think every park in the city should have opportunities for engagement for.\nSpeaker 3: Our youth and our.\nSpeaker 0: Seniors. Those are our two most vulnerable communities in terms of isolation.\nSpeaker 3: And the mental health and public health impacts that come along.\nSpeaker 0: And they don't have that that recreation and that that stimulus of interacting with others.\nSpeaker 3: That should be a major priority. And I think that's something that's called out in the report. But really, when we talk about.\nSpeaker 0: Health and we talk about access and and equity, we really need to be focused on making sure we have programing options available at all of our parks. We've talked a lot about undeveloped land. That's been a topic that's come up a lot to our council.\nSpeaker 0: And I appreciate Councilman Austin's comments regarding the efforts and the progress that has been made. I'll highlight how I will.\nSpeaker 3: Highlight also that Assemblyman O'Donnell also has helped us in developing.\nSpeaker 0: A helping develop some open spaces that weren't previously usable. And hopefully those will be very positive projects. And I look.\nSpeaker 3: Forward to that. But I'm wondering I'm not sure if there's a motion on this. Vice Mayor Is there a motion yet on this?\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I don't. I don't believe I heard a motion with Council on the Soros bill. First made one. The verdict. Was that emotion or not? I don't believe that.\nSpeaker 3: I didn't make a motion.\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to. Bryce, there's no motion on the floor.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, so I would make a motion to receive and file. But in addition, I know that the council members representing the.\nSpeaker 0: Areas where we've talked about a lack of park space are probably plugged into this. But I think for city wide we're hearing enough about it. But in addition.\nSpeaker 3: To receiving a file, I'd like to direct the city manager to come back to council within 30 to 60 days, whatever is feasible for him. On the feasibility of engaging stakeholders and creating an.\nSpeaker 0: Open park space plan for the undeveloped areas of land and the areas that we've identified as needing more park space. Which which, per the report in the comments tonight, would be central, west and north Long Beach, just to kind of see where we are with that.\nSpeaker 0: I know that's something that we've asked the city manager to look into and work on, but it would be nice to get a report back at this juncture now that we have our strategic plan in place. But I have no additional comment.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Next is councilwoman. They.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. And I would like to second Councilmember Price's motion. And first of all, thank you so, so much to our Parks and Rec, the Marine Department staff. I know that this has been a long time coming, but I'm super excited that we're here.\nSpeaker 3: I'm really happy to see all of the all of this the excitement around this strategic plan. I think this is fantastic. One of the things that I I also want to point out is that we acknowledge in this strategic plan, we acknowledge that we are on hunger land.\nSpeaker 3: And that makes me very, very proud that we actually were able to put it into our strategic plan. And a lot of people till this day don't know that. So it's very important to have something like that in there.\nSpeaker 3: I'm also very proud of the community input that was given. I'm so excited of all the collaboration that went on, especially from our commissioners as well. So thank you. Thank you for all of that. I think that it is very important that we that we acknowledge what a big, big high having open space in our community is\nSpeaker 3: , especially in these last two years, where that's where most of the community felt. See, and when we were forced to be inside, that was so good to be able to have some space to go and be able to social distance and be able to enjoy fresh air as much as we could.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm very happy about this. I do share the same sentiments when it comes to the maintenance of our parks. I think that we definitely need to make that a priority because I really think that safety and the maintenance of our parks go hand-in-hand because if you have a clean park, I really do believe that it encourages\nSpeaker 3: more safety around the park. So I really I'm glad that that that was brought up. I think it's very important. I also think it's very important that we bring up a lot of our I mean, that it was brought up that programing is essential, especially for our youth and our seniors.\nSpeaker 3: I think that that is a fantastic point, and that is usually who is able to take advantage of such programs that we offer. And I think we you know, we have such great programing and looking at the programing through equity lens is going to be highly important.\nSpeaker 3: And so I'm very happy to see that in this plan. Also, I you know, I wanted to make sure that everybody knows that, you know, all the hard work that has gone into this. And yet, yes, like it was mentioned, we are doing good, but there is a lot of work to do.\nSpeaker 3: And I am very confident that by adopting this plan, we can move forward and make our parks even more safer, more welcoming, and definitely more space for our residents to come and enjoy. So very, very happy to support the strategic plan for this for for the Department of Parks Rec and.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you. Next is council member supernova. Okay. Thank you. I have. First of all, great report and very impressive 151 page report. And kudos to the Fort District residents who read it and gave me some questions from the report.\nSpeaker 2: And I have I'll put it down to two questions. And the first one has to do with the SWOT analysis that Meredith mentioned. So if Meredith still there was 100% of the data derived from the general public in this report.\nSpeaker 2: SWOT analysis should.\nSpeaker 3: And the membership for the SWOT analysis was a staff activity. So the particular attachments that are included with the plan were made up of input from the department's leadership team, site supervisors and general staff across the different bureaus.\nSpeaker 3: We asked similar questions as part of our community engagement sessions, just not in the same framework of a SWOT analysis. So those questions could be a little bit more user friendly for the public that has incredible knowledge, but maybe not intimate staff knowledge.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you for that. So this puts the next comment in perspective then. Since the SWOT analysis came from staff, I had questions about placing City Council in the threat category. So if you want to check page 131, it's not that we're doing a bad job that we're going to call it in the column of weaknesses.\nSpeaker 2: We're actually a threat. So if you look under a Community Recreation Services Bureau. Some of the threats include climate change gangs, drug dealers, drug users, vandalism and city council. So I won't put you on the spot to answer tonight.\nSpeaker 2: It is a long report. There's a lot of stuff to look at here. But if you could get back to us, what what staff's thinking was in coming up with that scenario, that would be very helpful for us to do a better job of what we do.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I want to thank the staff and the community for their participation. There's been a lot of comments and a lot of important things have already been said. But I think that one of the things I've talked extensively about with the community and with our current director is that once the strategic plan is done, I think\nSpeaker 0: we really need to talk about our Parks master plan in terms of not just the spaces that are undeveloped, but as we look forward in determining which playgrounds need to be replaced, which playgrounds need to be fixed, where we need additional field space, all of those things and the types of amenities that are invested in.\nSpeaker 0: I think we really need to look at the city and the parks more like businesses do. So you might be super close to something, but the flow of traffic and the way that people drive and the amenities that they visit have a lot to do with different types of patterns that we've learned a lot about through our\nSpeaker 0: economic development department. And so I'd love to see us next steps move forward with understanding what amenities should be at what parks, and whether are our early education parks, what are our older kids parks? What amenities can be adjacent to each other for parents who have kids of multiple age groups?\nSpeaker 0: Where are the best places to just have open space? Where are the best places to offer classes? Where are the seniors coming to and from? Where are the bus stops that get people there and so on and so forth?\nSpeaker 0: So I know Brett and I have talked about this a lot and I've resisted putting forward an agenda item until this would come forward, because I know we've all got a lot that we're digesting and that this was a big project.\nSpeaker 0: But I look forward to a very robust discussion about those things because council offices and districts they change. But the way people drive to and from schools work where you can take your kids to a park on the way home from school or work, how that all fits together, where practices are, where classes are offered and there's\nSpeaker 0: a lot to it. And I think we need to do a really thorough job of understanding that. And as we make these major investments and then we can also see we're working on the all inclusive playground at Eldorado, where would the next one be?\nSpeaker 0: What does that amenity look like? We've talked a lot about adding certain inclusivity swings at certain parks. There needs to be a reason behind a system of why we choose what we choose and where to make really good investments for the future.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Right next is Councilman Allen.\nSpeaker 0: I thank you, vice mayor. And just also a big. Thank you to Brant and to Meredith and Nancy and just all the community for their involvement. The strategic plan is comprehensive and it outlined all the fantastic achievements of the city.\nSpeaker 0: So just a big congratulations for getting to this point. And I know it was a big lift. I saw in the plan that Bixby Park was the second most popular park in the city, and it's nowhere near the largest park.\nSpeaker 0: So I think it just goes to show how vital the urban park and open spaces are important to our residents. And I'm also sure as a result of COVID, that it's much more appreciated and used. I also wanted to say that these survey results validate what I've seen of the condition of our apart and and also the\nSpeaker 0: beach equipment. It needs some love. And I also want to say really quickly, I just a big thank you to assembly member Patrick O'Donnell. I just have to give him a shout out for our 850,000 for Bixby Park that he was able to secure from from the state.\nSpeaker 0: That money is going to go a long way in transforming that park very soon. In a big way. Also I want to say to the staff, thank you for responding to all my various questions about how you conducted and incorporated the public outreach plan.\nSpeaker 0: I had a lot of similar questions as a Councilwoman Alfaro, so I do appreciate all the details and the presentation on Slide 14. You see that goal. One Seek to ensure that all residents have safe, walkable or bikeable access to neighborhood park, which includes adding new park space and poor areas.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you for that. I do have a quick question. Can you can you just share with me a little bit more about future opportunities to offer concession agreements, some parks, and what those opportunities might look like and how that can help us maintain safe, clean and accessible parks.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen. That's really a great question. I think, you know, the past year, our entire leadership team has really utilized the pandemic to to look at all of our parks and our services with new opportunities.\nSpeaker 2: We've really reimagined a lot of the things that historically maybe the community has expected, but there's been a lot of really exciting best practices sprouting up from the pandemic in parks systems all across the country. So I do want to give credit to Nancy and her team, actually, Meredith, when she was our bureau manager for our planning\nSpeaker 2: and partnerships and initiated a lot of conversations with potential concessionaires, we did do an RFI to see what kind of interest we received scores of really creative possibilities that could be introduced into parks in north to south, east and west, and we'll be embarking on an RFP process shortly to really put a lot more substance to that\nSpeaker 2: . But we really do believe that by introducing a lot of those kind of visitor amenities in our parks, and it's really about serving the public so that they not only come to our parks with they enjoy their time there with their family or just individually.\nSpeaker 2: And some of the newer recreational opportunities can really enliven some of our parks where we do have challenges, where when we can introduce more positive activity. It really is very, very transformative. It makes our parks more welcoming, more appreciated, respected and actually safer.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm glad you asked that question. And we do have a lot of those initiatives moving forward. So thank you so much. All right, campers, remember your anger. Thank you. I've been listening to this with somewhat of a.\nSpeaker 2: Mixed emotions here. In the sense that while my website district has been mentioned quite a bit in terms of being park poor, we do have a West Side plan to get more parking space out there. Land. Land is hard to get, but it doesn't mean that we don't have the effort out there to try to create more\nSpeaker 2: land. One of the reasons why I voted against the the storage facility and the sequel Environmental Impact Report, there was a vote or two to accept the negative declaration because I felt that if we had a full square air study, it might have come out a little different so that we could create a little bit more park\nSpeaker 2: space in that area. I'd like to thank Supervisor Hahn for coming through and having identified that in those 11 acres that the Council member Austin mentioned, that we could create more park space. I'm not sure where that status is.\nSpeaker 2: I know that the Parks Recreation Department has come before and and trying to create the the total plan as to what parks are really park space in perpetuity. I continue to work with Parks Recreation to create more space to create more parks, especially in the West Long Beach area, because that's what we need, that we need and\nSpeaker 2: and we need, of course, funding and also looking into that. I've been. Several times. I'm talking to our assembly speaker and our representatives in Sacramento about identifying some funding so that we create more parking space as we need a year Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: And hopefully we will continue we're going to continue those efforts until we get a real positive response, because that's where that's where the fight is. The fight is funding, and it's not there now, but it doesn't mean that it's not going to be there tomorrow.\nSpeaker 2: So we continue to work with that and hopefully we can make a difference. That's not to say that this is not a good report. It's not a good a strategic plan. It is. But of course, I hope that we look at it from the fact that it's a document that it contains, that it can be adapted and\nSpeaker 2: that it can evolve to include a lot of other issues that we've got going here. One of the things that was mentioned before was that we were able to get some. Funding from us. Assemblymember O'Donnell for Bixby Park.\nSpeaker 2: I had a. I had a. A playground that burned down at the Admiral Kid Park. And unfortunately, those moneys weren't available for that. Although we do have we do have efforts to get some funding for that. But we have to go the route of having a a fundraiser for any donations.\nSpeaker 2: We shouldn't have to do that every time there's a playground destroyed. We have to have a plan so that when we have our our playgrounds damaged, that we can replace them fairly quickly and not have to wait an insurmountable amount of time to have that equipment replaced.\nSpeaker 2: So maybe in the future we can look at how we can incorporate some kind of funding mechanism in a strategic plan that would provide some funding in a in a, in a regular basis to address these kinds of issues where we have equipment that needs to be replaced or upgraded so that we don't have to keep our\nSpeaker 2: kids away for the park and not being able to take advantage of those facilities as well as the other facilities that we have in other programs. So for example, seniors lunch programs, home study, progress, homework sections, those types of things.\nSpeaker 2: So and I'll leave it at that for now. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman. And they have.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. I also wanted to point out. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Donna, for making those points. I also wanted to share and maybe start to share a little bit more details on the development that is happening on in the first District along the 710 with the Drake Chavez extension and the wetlands.\nSpeaker 3: I think that that's such an exciting time for for us right now to have that to have that coming and that plan that's been there and it's finally gotten some some funding. So it's coming alive. And also, we have the new Lincoln Park.\nSpeaker 3: This going to be opened very, very shortly. So really excited about that. So that maybe if you could just briefly touch on on the development of those plans that we have in place already.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, sure. That's a great topic, Councilwoman Zydus, and thank you for your leadership and and, you know, linking us to a lot of great community partners. So certainly within the Drake Chavez masterplan or Footprints, there's a lot of exciting movements I know that I'll be must project, which is congruent to that area.\nSpeaker 2: And you know, with the reconfiguration of of the bridge, the Shoemaker Bridge and the shoreline redevelopment or realignment, it opens up really a brand new canvas to create an even greater sense of place and open space for the West Side.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, certainly. It's no secret we're very, very excited about the advent of celebrating and dedicating the new Lincoln Park in a few weeks. You know, unfortunately, with with COVID, it's going to kind of reign us in with what we can actually do.\nSpeaker 2: But I think, you know, we'll make a virtual celebration and shout out the good news to the community for what I think will be, you know, a flagship of pride and certainly one of the best urban parks in the nation here to to complement the really world class development around Civic Center.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, the Billie Jean King Library, it's really the nucleus of a great destination. And I think we're very proud with even our smaller parks, you know, in and around the West Side, that there's a lot of really great things happening.\nSpeaker 2: I'm really happy with what's happening at the Armory and the adjacent minor park. I think that's really important. I know with redistricting, a lot of boundaries have shifted some of the parts of interest between you and your colleagues.\nSpeaker 2: But we we continue to look at it as a citywide park system, serving a really great community. And regardless of where the boundaries are, I know each of you are very dedicated and you understand the importance that Parks have been to the community, especially during during the pandemic.\nSpeaker 2: We a lot of great things happening, a lot of wonderful opportunities on the horizon. And so I'm glad you raised a question. Thank you so much. This is. Thank you, Councilwoman Ciro.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I think I wanted to clarify them the motion on the table at the moment. I think I heard Councilmember Price sharing that it's direct. The city managed to create kind of a report on open space is that the motion could.\nSpeaker 2: Now they go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Face amendments under developed. Okay. I just want to make sure that we don't create more plans when we have them, because we did I think Meredith did the before she left to go into I think to recover working on recovery when I think she created a three alarm beach park acquisition feasibility report that that identified all of\nSpeaker 3: the potential opportunity. And there's been several other reports that's been done around and just vision plans for spaces and parks like the Drake Chavez the vision plan to know the there's like the river the lower L.A. River revitalization plan that identify opportunity spaces adjacent to the river, uptown open space.\nSpeaker 3: So so I definitely, you know, and supportive of making sure we identify them. I think that we have and they've been listed here. I think there's over 120 something sites. So I just didn't want to make I just want to make sure we're not doing more redundant.\nSpeaker 3: And it's really looking into, I think what Councilmember Durango was speaking to is looking at our funding, making sure we are funding and in prioritizing what we want to do. So that's just what I just want. Make sure we don't do it doesn't work and we have the plan already.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Austin. Thank you. I'll be really brief. I just want to follow up on those councilmembers and there's a couple of points that she made, but also just, I think. We also need to highlight some of the good work that has actually happened over the last ten years or so in some of these areas that we have\nSpeaker 2: identified as areas of need. Specifically with the Dominguez Gap, the forest wetlands. Know it's about 70 acres right there of park space that have been developed. It's passive use park space along a river that has been developed over the last ten years because of the city council's dedication and recognizing a need there.\nSpeaker 2: And so and I said on the lower L.A. River Task Force hand up to this work with a number of different cities and stakeholders in the a year long process, looking at opportunities, as you know, from miles and miles of L.A. River.\nSpeaker 2: Nowhere no cities have developed like the city of Long Beach has. And not only that, I know Little Springs is also another area which significant acreage has been developed in the central are more city and as part space.\nSpeaker 2: So in the eighth district alone, 40 acres of new park space and of passive as well as active recreation space has been developed. So I think it's important that we also highlight and celebrate our successes as a city, but also understand that we still have a lot of opportunity to grow.\nSpeaker 2: And so I highlighted 11 more acres of opportunity space for here in the city. And I see that that that's just an opportunity. Right. I just highlighted that in an area that we're also focusing on. So again, to our Parks and Recreation staff, you all did a great feasibility report about a year ago, came back with good\nSpeaker 2: information. I think we build on that document. We build on this strategic plan, and we will build an equitable future for our city. Thank you. Right. Thank you. That concludes council comment. We still have six people that that are in line to speak.\nSpeaker 2: I want to go to staff quickly, you know, in hearing the conversation. I think we want to just make sure that, you know, we acknowledge the good things that have happened, the progress being made. We also don't want to go back and start to reengage stakeholders around work that's already done.\nSpeaker 2: Council is a day sorry that you know, as it relates to outreach, we've done a lot of outreach, the uptown open space plan. I mean, they've got an American Planning Association word for outreach and identified an inventory of every vacant parcel just in District nine.\nSpeaker 2: But I know that there's additional work like what Meredith has done and others, but we don't want to do is imply that that work had been done. I think we're at the place now because we've done so much in terms of identifying inventory, as far as identifying vision and engaging the community.\nSpeaker 2: What we need for the city to do and it's Grant and his budget is to put his money where his mouth is. That's what we truly need to do is now pull the trigger and develop these parks in open spaces.\nSpeaker 2: And we've seen some great success, but we need to do more, particularly if we know that we have another state budget surplus and there may be additional investments coming down. We know that there was a conversation about earmarks.\nSpeaker 2: I'm not sure if that's going to happen either. But we just need to make sure as we apply for funds, it reflects what this document actually says and that we're building on the things that are already outlined. Let's go to public comment.\nSpeaker 4: Dave Shukla, your three minute starts now.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. I already to you. You can read it or not. But since we're talking about opportunity space, I like that concept a lot. Uh, it may be redundant given the conversation. I think it's very, very deliberative and, frankly, a productive council conversation.\nSpeaker 2: Kind of amazing. Um, but the one point that everyone seems to kind of keep in on, and I think that we should underscore is how we acquire. Convert and site land for park space. That's important. It's path constrained not just by things like state budget surpluses and funding cycles, but also some of our fiscal requirements.\nSpeaker 2: And, uh. You know, maybe those things align with existing development pressures. Maybe they don't. But as. Uh, Councilmember Arun said, you know these. These faces have got to make sense in 20 years scale, 100 years scale. Perpetuity scale.\nSpeaker 2: Um, and so, yeah, I, I, I just, uh, take this opportunity to shamelessly plug the cows in rulemaking because there's, there's a lot of oil and gas land that was, uh, kind of a parcel that quick and easy in our city's history.\nSpeaker 2: And unlike most states, we don't have these these setbacks for health and safety. If we were to, uh, based on some special analysis they did of AB 345 a couple of years ago, uh, just in Long Beach, we'd have more land than was bought up and sold back up through already a.\nSpeaker 2: It could be a lot of land. They don't make more land. You know, like in the Superman films, like Luigi Rizzo was trying to make more land. Like they don't make more land. You could get more land. So yeah, think about that.\nSpeaker 2: Might be a good time to convert to a livable economy. Uh, thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Our next speaker is Leslie Gerritsen.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. And myself. Thank you. What a great report with tremendous information. I'd like to quickly, quickly introduce myself. Leslie Garrett, then. I'm a resident from Reno. I am also a board member of River Park Coalition. And I know we had some wonderful.\nSpeaker 0: Speech.\nSpeaker 3: Tonight for those of you who may not be aware of the coalition we formed about a year and a half ago, and we're working diligently on greenspace with the West Side, specifically in response to 37 to 1 specific place.\nSpeaker 3: We do have pending litigation and we are very hopeful. And thank you for bringing it up. We really want to see that air. That being said, let me go ahead and talk a little bit about the report. I thought it was a tremendous job and we met a lot of work that went into place.\nSpeaker 3: I know in my community here in Rosarito, our park is utilized what we and fortunately work on the neighborhood list for outreach. So I want to make sure we have that going forward. In addition, one of the things that I really hit home for me was talking about the fact that 14,000 of our trees of 32,000 so\nSpeaker 3: have are disease dying or being removed. And what I read about the maintenance, which is a huge problem in our city based on looking at that report. So I'm curious when I read about the park impact fees for proposed housing developments in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: They are a source of funding that can be used for the park maintenance.\nSpeaker 0: There was a Quimby.\nSpeaker 3: Act passed in 1975 which required developers to set aside land or funds to pay fees for park improvements. So the first park impact fees, they were implemented in our city in 1989. However, these fees have not been increased since 2010.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm curious, why hasn't that happened? There's a lot of development going on. And the other question I have and don't expect an answer now. Where do those funds actually go? Did they go into the general fund or they go for maintenance?\nSpeaker 3: And the last what I wanted to make is the fact that there are already a lot of plans that have been in place. I know there was conversation about the lower L.A. River. We had some great meetings this time with Patrick O'Donnell, who's been a supporter of ours and also Councilmember Austin.\nSpeaker 3: I am really looking forward to seeing some of these plans to come into fruition. And I want to make sure I, as a community member involved in helping make this stuff happen in our community. So thank you very much to the Parks and Rec Department PRM for putting it together.\nSpeaker 3: I know it was a lot of work and I am excited to identify some of the deficiencies and looking forward to help over the next ten years of these plans. Construction.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: But will the individual with the telephone number ending in 4013. Please press star six your time again to the.\nSpeaker 0: Hi. My name is. We're not in either. I am with the Hamilton Neighborhood Association. Our neighborhood borders paramount and this. Strategic plan is near and dear to our heart because we have zero accessible. Parkland or open space for the public.\nSpeaker 0: And I believe I speak for all the North End neighborhoods, starting as well as McKinley. When I speak to the fact we need as much open space and park space as we can get. And I really appreciate the effort that has been put into this by Parks and Rec, and I appreciate the level in which this has\nSpeaker 0: been presented. I also just want to end with as tag receive, and that's what we have to do now. We can't receive and file. We have to receive an act. We're desperate for open space. We're so desperate that we built we take little tiny areas of our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 0: We throw a picnic table on it and a few trees, and we call it our open space and we maintain it as residents. We need this plan. We need it to come to fruition. We also have in plan a Hamilton loop that we have been working on for several years since 2014.\nSpeaker 0: It's supposed to open up the freeway areas around. The freight around the freeway from Atlantic to Kerry. Vice Mayor Rex Richardson has been a huge supporter with us on this. It's taken the collaboration of Caltrans, the county, the city.\nSpeaker 0: It's hard to get all these folks together, but I really appreciate the effort that's been put forth and that as well with these plans in place, the strategic strategic plan, as well as the 91 greenbelt plan, we will be able to at least have some open space.\nSpeaker 0: I hear people talking about maintenance. I agree with that too. But please just understand, there are parts of this city that have zero open space. Thank you for listening. Have a great day.\nSpeaker 4: Our next speaker is Mariella Salgado.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I come to you as vice chair of the Parks Commission? We serve as an advisory board to you and our city regarding park lands, plans and improvements and other budgetary priorities. Our parks do not have unions or lobbyists to advocate for its needs or importance in the community.\nSpeaker 0: Yet it plays a crucial role in the health of our community, particularly for our youth, our 0 to 8 population and zero four seniors. As many experienced in the pandemic, our parks and open spaces became a focal point for health and will also highlight the importance it plays in providing afterschool and summer programing and child care for\nSpeaker 0: our families. Our park system is one families heavily rely on for recreational opportunities. Affordable programing and an important childcare provider for our workforce, particularly women. This department and our world of commissioners has equal importance and relevance as public safety.\nSpeaker 0: This plan lays the foundation for future priorities and investments. As such, I'd like to highlight the importance of our approach to advance health equity. A Goal within the Racial Reconciliation Report. You all voted unanimously to advance racial equity in language.\nSpeaker 0: This initiative also references Park Equity, recognizing the impact of open space on health for those who need it most. Hello.\nSpeaker 2: We can hear you.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I'm sorry. Did you guys hear me earlier?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, we heard you.\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. Um.\nSpeaker 3: In its current iteration.\nSpeaker 0: Our commission recommended the park in health equity goal number three to be the primary goal. Its current iteration stays safe and accessible public spaces as a primary goal and in my opinion, maintains the status quo. This plan presents an opportunity for you all to ensure there is a prioritization of projects, investments and programing to address historical disinvestment\nSpeaker 0: policies and systems that have negatively impacted a majority of our residents across the city. To change the future of park investments, where residents in Long Beach have access to nearly 16 times the park space and those living in Watts, Long Beach and park plants like my car park and masterplan aquatic recreation in North Beach no longer remain\nSpeaker 0: in planning phases for 22 to 30 years. As a first District resident, our Drake Jarvis Master Plan is well over 25 years old. I also want to add an important plan that was included in the strategic plan is the city's early childhood education strategic plan that promotes the well-being of our 0 to 8 population.\nSpeaker 0: This plan was not included in this plan, and it should. You see, this plan discusses the importance of increasing the quality of programs delivered to young children, remove barriers to quality, educate early education and access to green spaces regardless of ability and geography.\nSpeaker 0: Park investments promote positive outcomes for our city. Our parks plays a vital role in meeting so many of our city goals, from health initiatives to economic empowerment and make eating more equitable. You bear the responsibility for.\nSpeaker 3: Promoting.\nSpeaker 0: Equitable access to resources and services to minimize the disparities our residents experience. I hope you will consider our Parks Commission recommendation to place equity as the primary goal. Hamilton neighborhood as a comment was submitted earlier. Should have given space.\nSpeaker 0: But I won't if we do.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Our next speaker is Rae Garbage.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. Thank you very much. I am a member of Carp Citizens about responsible planning, Long Beach Reform, Coalition and Neighborhoods First. I also served on the Parks and Rec Commission from 1985 to 1993, and we have the same story.\nSpeaker 0: We have the same challenges. We had the same issues. I look at listen to you, and I appreciate so much the work that goes into it. But I think what we really have to look at is to stop repeating the problems or glossing over them.\nSpeaker 0: And then what happens is you get to a budget time and you have to me, you city council have to make budget cuts. And if I understand it correctly, I think we're somewhere between 13 and 30 million deficit this year.\nSpeaker 0: But regardless, those cuts have to be made and they seem to be made on the backs of Parks and Rec rather consistently over the years. The water budget has not been added to for Parks and Rec and they pay their own water bill.\nSpeaker 0: The cemeteries, when they were added, they went on the responsibility of Parks and Rec with no increase in their budget. That's something that I really, really ask you as council members to pay attention to when you come up to the next budget period.\nSpeaker 0: We have places in our city Eldorado Park Area three. The ponds and the walkways are atrocious. They are not accessible. They're dangerous. Those should have been fixed years ago. Shire Park, the pond that has not been functioning as intended for years since I was on the Parks and Rec Commission, the bathrooms in our parks and our beaches\nSpeaker 0: should not be locked, but they should be maintained. And I know it's all about money. It's all comes down to the dollars. So how we spend it, you know, maybe those priorities need to change. Also, I was reviewing the 2021 salaries last summer, and I found that we have a number of mid-level management people in Parks and\nSpeaker 0: Rec with fewer worker bees, so the work doesn't get done. So we contract with check that instead of having those people on board that really love their work and took pride in taking care of their city. You know, I know I'm about out of time.\nSpeaker 0: So, you know, we've lost ten and a half acres, in my opinion, with the Boy Scout Park. We've lost acreage at that. The biggest gap opportunity for both storage. And now there's another seventh District residential project in the pipeline that could be Parkland.\nSpeaker 0: So I hope that you will look at that when when Councilmember Urunga said land is hard to get. It is hard to get, but we have a lot what we did have a lot of surplus city owned properties that can become pocket parks, not quick sales without some benefit to Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 0: And the Trust for Public Lands was a great organization that we tried to work with. Of course, when when times were tough, when we were in the Great Depression area, it was hard. They didn't have the they didn't have the money available to them as well.\nSpeaker 0: We also were.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. That speaker is Laura Summer.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. My name is Laura Soma. Thank you very much for this second chance of public comment. I would like to point your to page 33 of this plan. There are three excellent maps on the plan, the first one being the Long Beach Red Lighting.\nSpeaker 3: The 34 years of redlining that Long Beach experienced during the building years of postwar. And then the second map is people of color in Long Beach. And then the third map is called Park Equity. The only correction I'd make on this page is I would title that park in quality because but these three images, I think, tell\nSpeaker 3: the story of this entire clan.\nSpeaker 0: And I think the remedies.\nSpeaker 3: Are pretty clear that we do that. The city does need to support park development in the west, central and north. I do support the motion to have a city manager come back and report if plans are already in place.\nSpeaker 3: I believe those can be part of the report, but we do have 25 acres, I think currently under a proposal to become an RV park. And turning back to the map with people of color. I'm just looking at this.\nSpeaker 3: That community want a park or does the community really want an RV storage?\nSpeaker 0: And I think that's a big outstanding question.\nSpeaker 3: I'll read a quote from the strategic plan here. It says, There is lack of equity in terms of park space and open land versus East Long Beach. There's so much need in the west, central and north Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: Where there are more residents living in denser neighborhoods that each deserve their own Eldorado Park. And I will close with page 102. One of the first actions is to establish Park Equity acquisition. But it says guidelines. But I believe one of those.\nSpeaker 0: Guidelines is to acquire.\nSpeaker 3: The park land before. It's built in and covered with concrete. And I think that's why it's applicable. When you're going to build an RV park on 25 acres, you might want to step back and really consider the real purpose.\nSpeaker 3: Should that be parkland for the community? And then it does say also here in this slide, just partner with the county. And, you know, the county of Los Angeles did a lot of redlining on their own. It was a cause.\nSpeaker 3: It was a nationwide, horrible phenomenon. But the county I believe the county would thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Well, the individual with the telephone number ending in 7340. Your time begins now. Please press star six.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. This is Karen Recite. I'm president of the Long Beach Gray Panthers. And we appreciate park staff. We see them go above the board, above board and be on their job every single day. And we're we're not in favor of adopting this plan right now because I'm going to address some senior issues.\nSpeaker 0: We feel that there there are gaps that are missing that need to be included in the plan. And we really appreciate your ability to be open in discussing these issues. If we're talking about equity, you know, there's very little mention of the YouTube community.\nSpeaker 0: They do use our parks quite heavily or the disabled community, and most of our parks are not really accessible. So these issues need to be included in the plan. We don't think the goals are specific enough. You know, what gets written in is what's going to get done, and if it's not written in, it won't get done\nSpeaker 0: . Are we going to have police in our parks? Are we going to park rangers? I can't go in and out the front door of the senior center because we have people, some.\nSpeaker 2: Of them drug users.\nSpeaker 0: And it's not safe. So seniors are particularly targets for people that are looking to do damage. And the there's not really a lot of discussion about what's going to happen with seniors as one of the newest partners for the Parks and Rec.\nSpeaker 0: So we've been in space at the senior center for four months. We have handed out 400 warm coats to seniors that have to stand out in the cold to get their food during food distribution days. And they didn't have coats.\nSpeaker 0: So we got them coats. Working with the National Council of Jewish Women and Chase Bank, we distributed help distribute. We paid for 168 Thanksgiving meals. So seniors that came to the senior centers have a Thanksgiving dinner in partnership with Partners Apart, we have distributed 276 dining cards in over 250 grocery cards, and we've done that at 40\nSpeaker 0: senior centers. We have held a senior center safety forum with the police, got the police more engaged with the senior center and keeping the seniors safe. And we had over 100 attendees and everybody received lunch. We distributed over 1000 caps and scarves to seniors all across the community.\nSpeaker 0: And these are things that nobody talks about. The grocery cards I could give out probably ten times the grocery cards that we have money for.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Let's move to the n roll, please.\nSpeaker 1: That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 2: I spoke to a local police.\nSpeaker 1: District one. My district to.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: District three.\nSpeaker 3: II.\nSpeaker 1: District four.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: District five. I. District six. I. District seven.

        "source": "Speaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 8: Good evening, Mayor Spencer, Vice Mayor Matt Rossi, members of the council. My name is Andrew Thomas, city planner. We're here before you tonight for three subsequent actions implementing the Del Monte Warehouse Master Plan. I'm going to quickly go through a number of slides, two or three slides, and I'm going to hand the podium over to Victoria from\nSpeaker 8: the Housing Authority, who is going to do the last couple of slides for us tonight. This is a basically a joint presentation between myself and the Housing Authority. And then we'll both be available to answer questions. Just to remind everyone, the project we're talking about is the Del Monte Warehouse Master Plan.\nSpeaker 8: This was approved by the council in December of 2014 and included a development agreement. Just a couple of the highlights from that master plan focusing on the major public benefits. The plan, of course, includes the preservation of this city monument.\nSpeaker 8: It's privately owned, but it's a designated city monument. It's also on the National Register of Historic Places. So it's preserving this building for future generations. It's a mixed use plan with 380 units spread primarily within the main building, but also two smaller pads that we'll be talking about tonight.\nSpeaker 8: Within the total project, it includes 55 affordable housing units. And tonight, we want to focus on the affordable component of the project. It also includes the major public improvement capital project. That's the extension of the Clement Avenue from Atlantic to Sherman behind the building.\nSpeaker 8: And it included $2 million for Jean Sweeney Park. So I just quickly update you. We've had a busy six months since that approval. Working to implement that plan and everything so far has gone as planned within. Within a few weeks of the approval, the development team transmitted the first $300,000 installment of the 2,000,004 Gene Sweeney Park.\nSpeaker 8: And you are very capable. Parks and Recreation Department also submitted applications for matching grants. And I think I can. I can announce that they were successful and quickly turn the $2 million contribution from the development from this development into a matched it with a 2 million state grant.\nSpeaker 8: It was state state grant. So with the private 2 million plus the state 2 million. And I think you also have another 2.5. We now have the city has $6.5 million for the improvement at that park, which is a major accomplishment.\nSpeaker 8: We are also been working with Wind River, which is owned by Intel, I believe, on the acquisition of the land for the Clement Avenue extension. Some of that land to complete the road. The developer needs to buy some land from Wind River.\nSpeaker 8: So those those negotiations are ongoing. I personally have had a few meetings with the representatives. They fly out from Boston occasionally because Wind River is owned by Intel. They're actually going to be here tomorrow. And they did want me to pass on a message to you that although they couldn't be here for tonight's meeting, they are very\nSpeaker 8: pleased about the idea of the Clement Avenue extension, and they plan to have their negotiations done with TLC. That's Tim Louis Communities, who is the project developer very soon there. They're also anxious just to complete those discussions. It's going to benefit the Wind River campus as well, provide that second access the as part of their original plan\nSpeaker 8: or the master plan that was also imminent. You will remember a lot of discussion in the neighborhood about parking, and there was a sequence of studies that needed to be done. And the first study where the development team and staff worked with the neighborhood to create the baseline study structure and that initial study was completed.\nSpeaker 8: It's really just creating the baseline so that when the project starts to develop and when it's complete, they can go back and redo the study and see if there's been an impact on the neighborhood for parking. Then in May, the planning board approved all the approved the next phase, the design review phase for the affordable housing, which\nSpeaker 8: was what was the very next step that we had laid out in the master plan. They also recommended that the planning that the City Council approve the tentative map, which is one of the actions tonight. And I just also wanted to report I know there was a lot of conversation in December and January about the fact that\nSpeaker 8: we had phase three approvals and didn't have all of the density bonus materials in hand in December because of the phase nature of the project. All those materials are now complete and and we're moving on. With this project.\nSpeaker 8: So tonight, three actions. The first one, the tentative map. This basically just implements the plan. This is a drawing literally from the master plan. And it shows how this parcel, which is a little over nine acres, will be divided into seven lots.\nSpeaker 8: Three of them will be for actual development. The first is Lot A is, of course, the building itself. B is a parcel at the roughly at the corner of Sherman and Bueno Vista. And I just want to point out, you'll see on the drawing there's one I got a piece there which is shown with a yellow arrow\nSpeaker 8: . The stimulus community owns the top half of B, the city owns the bottom half of B, so the map does not deal with the city piece. It's just subdividing the land that's owned by Tim Louis communities. And then C is a third vacant pad for future development.\nSpeaker 8: And then it creates four lots for for the roadway network. It's no different from what was anticipated in the master plan but sets up and helps to finance the project. And phasing of the public infrastructure so that where for example when we build clement and just remind the council and the public when Clement is built, it's going\nSpeaker 8: to be deeded back to the city as a public road. So where we're trying to set up the later conveyances of property between the city and Telus communities as well. On the public infrastructure. The second item. So the planning board unanimously recommended approval of the tentative map.\nSpeaker 8: And that recommendation was, of course, to the city council who has final authority on that tentative map. I just wanted to now zoom in to that left hand corner at Sherman and Buena Vista. And this is the second item we're recommending that the council enter into a purchase purchase option agreement with the City of Alameda Housing Authority\nSpeaker 8: for the small piece of land that the city owns right at the corner of Sherman and Bueno Vista. And it's shown on this drawing as the sort of parcel a it's approximately just under half an acre. It's right on the corner of of the of the project.\nSpeaker 8: It used to be an old railroad right of way. And then the city always owned a little piece on the corner there as well. Well, the railroad actually had an easement across city property at that location. So the idea here is that the city would convey or provide an a purchase option to the housing authority for that\nSpeaker 8: little that little corner piece identified as a on the map. If the city if the city council approves the first reading tonight of that option agreement and it does require four votes, then what Tim Lewis is going to the developers will do is they will convey parcel B just to the to the above it to the housing\nSpeaker 8: authority as well. And what that will then do is give the housing authority the two pieces and essentially just under an acre of land, 0.8 acres upon which they will be building 31, very low and low income housing units for seniors on this site.\nSpeaker 8: So that's the gist of the purchase option agreement. Of course, if the housing authority is unable to acquire the financing, Tim Lewis is giving them land. They're also giving them cash and doing all the infrastructure to support the pad.\nSpeaker 8: Housing Authority will be applying for tax. Tax credit. Thank you. That's a tax increment. No, it's not tax increment. It's tax credits financing for this project. But if they fail or for some reason the project does not proceed as we have planned, of course, because it's an option agreement, the land would then come back to the city\nSpeaker 8: . So if the project doesn't work, for some reason you would be getting this land back and we're available. The city attorney's office has been very involved in this document, as well as the housing authority. So we're all available to answer more questions.\nSpeaker 8: I won't get into all the details on it tonight. Senior housing, senior affordable housing on that corner. We were we are very excited about this. Throughout the Del Monte planning process with the neighborhood, there was a lot of discussion about how nice it would be to have seniors living on the site for a variety of reasons.\nSpeaker 8: They have a very low parking impact. Once again, parking was a concern. So senior housing is always nice from a traffic and parking perspective. It also implements a citywide need. Just in 2014, the city updated its housing element.\nSpeaker 8: As you probably remember, we did it just two years prior in 2012. So the city staff approach was, okay, we just this will be a quick update. The one policy issue that everybody in this community, the planning board, the housing commission, everyone sort of said, hey, not so fast, staff.\nSpeaker 8: There is a major policy need in this city and it's about senior housing. So it's great to be coming back in six, nine months with a senior housing project. The master plan also anticipated on these two outer pads, and this would be developed on one of them, a, you know, buildings up to 55 feet.\nSpeaker 8: And that generated a little bit of concern in the neighborhood. It was like, okay, maybe that, but it feels a little tall for that corner. This project is coming in at 37 feet in height. So, you know, it's a little bit less of a visual impact on the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 8: We're also are pleased from just from a senior housing perspective. We, as you all know, we have an DIAMANTI project at the end of Park Street on the East End, 62 units. We have, of course, Independence Plaza on the West End, 186 senior units.\nSpeaker 8: And Del Monte is sort of very nicely situated, right, kind of in central Alameda. So it just feel felt to us that this was just a great fit for senior affordable housing. And then at this point, I'd like to turn the mic over to Victoria Johnson from the Housing Authority, who is going to finish it out.\nSpeaker 2: A good evening, mayor. Vice mayor, members of the council, members of the public and staff. Thank you. My name is Victoria Johnson. I'm the director of development and housing at the Housing Authority. We were first approached the housing authority was first approached by Tim Lewis communities last summer.\nSpeaker 2: It's been over a year since we've been working on this project. We were very excited. We were actually very surprised. We were asked if we'd be interested in partnering with Tim Lewis communities to develop an affordable project. And we we staff went to our board board of Commissioners and the board agreed that that was a great opportunity\nSpeaker 2: . At that time, we had not made the decision whether the units would be family or affordable. But looking at our own community opinion, looking at our housing need, looking at our own waiting lists, listening to discussions right here at city council.\nSpeaker 2: And based on all of that, we went back to our board and asked if we could proceed with a plan for senior housing, and the answer was yes. So our Board of Commissioners is very supportive of senior. That does not mean that there is not an equal demand for family housing, but we have to make a choice\nSpeaker 2: because no matter which funding program we use, it's necessary to define one or the other family or senior. And we made that choice that we would ask for authority to develop a senior project. So I want to talk a little bit about what type of senior projects the Housing Authority would develop and operate and focus on the\nSpeaker 2: service enrichment that's available to folks that will live in this community. The building itself will have a community center, a computer lab, a lobby designed for congregating a covered patio for outdoor recreation. And there's a courtyard that is designed for mild exercise for folks that are much very mobility impaired, but still need to get out every day\nSpeaker 2: and get some fresh air and exercise. We've actually designed the courtyard so there's a pathway and you can walk a small distance around the courtyard. We have a lot of experience in the housing authority in senior communities. We spent an extensive number of hours working with the architect to talk about ways that everything from the trash room\nSpeaker 2: to the laundry room will be designed to accommodate seniors. All of the units will be accessible. They will not be 100% ADA compliant. Only a percentage will be. But all of the units will be accessible wide doorways, showers, not tubs, grab bars, a wide range of of facilities that allow residents to age in place.\nSpeaker 2: We now, as Andrew mentioned, do have two older properties. And in particular, the oldest of the properties was built in the sixties and it was not designed for aging in place. And we have to very often go in and make physical adjustments to those units.\nSpeaker 2: So we we now understand people live longer, people want to stay at home. And so we really have been able to design this project to accommodate that those long lifespans and an active life lifespan as well. Within the building.\nSpeaker 2: We will also have senior services. The there will be a licensed licensed social worker available to the residents. They'll also be a regular part time, not a full time, but a regular there perhaps as many as five days a week, half time social services coordinator who will do everything from planning poetry readings and parties to making sure\nSpeaker 2: that the residents have the services, the connection to the services that they need, which is potentially meals assistance with housekeeping, the medical referrals that are necessary. So we have very experienced social providers who are used to our senior population, and this will be available to all of our residents.\nSpeaker 2: We will also make ample use of the code required capacious bicycle storage area and we will have, we want to say will have senior tricycles so that people can check out bicycles, tricycles and and take advantage of the great weather and the nice level sidewalks.\nSpeaker 2: The property itself is part of the larger Del Monte project. And so there'll be an opportunity for people to stroll over to Littlejohn Park. This drawing to the left, their shoes, you'll see there's a kind of pink crosswalk highlighted in the upper left, and it's just walking across two lanes of traffic, 26 feet.\nSpeaker 2: You can cross over from the sidewalk in front of the senior building to the main building. And there's actually two crosswalks and it's about 500 feet to walk to the proposed retail uses. Those uses have not been specifically defined, but we're assuming it'll be a coffee shop, a dry cleaner, and maybe a bookstore, some or something.\nSpeaker 2: That would be a reason to walk. And so we think that's a great opportunity to get out and about and meet friends. And we'll also be a number of outdoor recreational areas. And then of course for the very active, there'll be a trail into the soon to be developed Jean Sweeney Park and so some of our.\nSpeaker 2: Seniors will be we assumed jogging through Jean Sweeny Park for for real active lifestyle. So we generally we just think it's an amazing location. This is a tremendous opportunity. The Mastic Senior Center is just a few blocks away.\nSpeaker 2: We couldn't have asked for anything more perfect in terms of location for seniors. And next slide, I push. Thank you. Okay. So that is a description of the site. And of course, we can answer questions if there are additional questions that Andrew mentioned, that there are three actions being considered tonight.\nSpeaker 2: So the third action is to approve the affordable housing agreement. This agreement is a fairly standard part of each one of the affordable projects that's been developed over the really the past 20 years. Every inclusionary project within the city has a governing affordable housing agreement.\nSpeaker 2: It is the regulatory agreement that mandates affordability for 59 years, and it also specifies the nature of the income targeting. So in this in this example, it will require 31 affordable rental units that they remain affordable for at least 59 years and that there be 17 very low and 14 low income units.\nSpeaker 2: With housing authority ownership, it is nearly certain that the affordability will be perpetual. That's for a number of different reasons, most obviously because that is the purpose of our agency. And as long as we retain ownership, we would we would never seek to end the affordability period, but also the way the regulatory programs are written at the\nSpeaker 2: state level, the projects that are affordable. And because the state has learned, many of the projects that were developed in the sixties and seventies fell out of affordability. And so there's a real concern now at the state level with preservation.\nSpeaker 2: So the new regulations, the more recent regulations are designed so that the affordability restriction renews through a variety of mechanisms. And and so that's very important to us as a as the affordable housing provider. So that affordable housing agreement has been tailored to this project.\nSpeaker 2: Our our city attorney has work with our outside counsel. And we we believe that we have a very satisfactory form of agreement of the timeline for the development of the senior project is intended to be coterminous with the market rate project.\nSpeaker 2: If all goes well, we get the vote and we secure the funding. We would expect to commence construction as soon as potentially the end of 2016, just, you know, a year and a half from now. And that our project completion would coincide with the first occupancy of the market rate units.\nSpeaker 2: So again, we're very excited and we welcome your questions. If you have questions, of course, Andrew and I are here. Our architect, someone from the architectural firm of B.a.r, is here to answer any questions about design or site plan.\nSpeaker 2: And also the housing authority outside counsel is here to answer any legal questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Those questions first. I swear.\nSpeaker 3: If you don't secure the funding to build, what happens?\nSpeaker 2: So when I say the uncertainty, there's always uncertainty. Any loan application is, you know, an application. So we have to succeed. With most of the affordable housing programs, the funding is oversubscribed as as as everyone knows. And I would say that if we fail in the first year, we would succeed in the second year.\nSpeaker 2: There's never a certainty. But there's no reason to believe that the level of oversubscription is so great. And the State Allocating Committee has recently revised the regulations so that smaller projects actually have a better shot. And this is considered a small project.\nSpeaker 2: So we feel quite confident that if we do not succeed in year one, we would succeed in year two.\nSpeaker 3: But if you fail, what happens?\nSpeaker 2: Well, if we failed completely, we have several options. Option one is that the developer, the master developer, is obligated by the development agreement to provide the gap funding. And we also, as the housing authority, would be willing to make more of a contribution of public resources subject to the Board of Water Commissioners.\nSpeaker 2: Approval, of course.\nSpeaker 3: So if we fail to get the funding by the Housing Authority, the developers not obligated to build these affordable units, that we would have to backstop it with public funds that would sit.\nSpeaker 2: And sorry if I wasn't clear. So the the plan a scenario is for the housing authority to apply for competitive tax credits and the developer to provide gap funding, which is millions and millions of dollars. If that fails, there's a there's a plan B, there's a secondary tax credit program, which is the noncompetitive tax credit program.\nSpeaker 2: We could apply in a subsequent round to that noncompetitive program. But as you might guess, the noncompetitive program is not as financially lucrative and the developers contribution would be greater. But that is a is a very viable plan B, there is much less uncertainty.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm just looking for the answer that in any event, we're going to have 55 affordable units and we're not going to have to pay for it. It's going to come from the developer. Correct.\nSpeaker 8: It's the developer's responsibility to provide 55 affordable housing units on this project. It was the basis upon which they got their density bonus. If the housing authority fails or forever for any reason, tomorrow walks away from this and says, You know what, we have other priorities.\nSpeaker 8: We're not interested anymore. The House. The project must provide the 55. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member Odie.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam Chair. I just had two questions. So on this purchase option, it says height at 37, not 55. Is that 37? If we for some reason don't approve the purchase option, is the height still 37 or does it go back up to 55?\nSpeaker 3: All right.\nSpeaker 0: Well, thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: I am Stephen Hedges, one of the senior architects at B.a.r. Thank you for joining us. So the height limit is so there's an Alameda datum and then there's the height over the great plain of the building. So the 37 is it was a great pane, the building from level one.\nSpeaker 5: Could you speak a little closer to the.\nSpeaker 3: Third, the 37 feet? It's from the first floor level. The higher number you're seeing is off the Alameda datum, which a civil engineer could speak to a little bit more than I can. But it isn't. So we're going off level one, which is zero.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 8: I think if I understood your question, it was the master plan which is already adopted says the maximum that this that any building on this site can be as 55 feet.\nSpeaker 3: Right.\nSpeaker 8: The Housing Authority has designed a building that is approximately 37 feet tall. So it's less than the height limit. But if the housing authority walks away or they don't get this option agreement or they never get this corner piece, Tim Lewis can still develop their piece.\nSpeaker 8: That's little piece B. Mm hmm. And they can go up to 55 feet. Okay. Under the master plan.\nSpeaker 4: And my second question, and I really hate to ask this because I normally don't get into this, but I did get a constituent letter. And, you know, given the historic significance of of the Del Monte, is that designed in stone?\nSpeaker 8: Of the building itself.\nSpeaker 4: No, this this the senior housing. My personal opinion, I think it looks out of place next to the Del Monte building. Are we too far down the path there on this.\nSpeaker 8: Or it has? We have moved by the planning board. We did. And working with B.a.r and our historians. I mean, it's this is part of the.\nSpeaker 4: And I'm sorry, I don't like to get into.\nSpeaker 8: No, no, it's things, I guess. I'm glad you asked. What they are trying to do is not try to reproduce that El Monte building. They're trying to contrast with the Del Monte building and not try to. So that's, that's the concept behind the design.\nSpeaker 8: From an architectural. Yeah, they did achieve.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry.\nSpeaker 4: No, I think the vice mayor. I mean, it it just it would seem, in my opinion, again, I'm not an architect, but, you know, we're in a neighborhood of homes where next to this landmark that a building that would look perfectly fine on an Alameda point or you know over at Alameda Landing just just seems a little\nSpeaker 4: bit out of place to me. So I don't know if we have an ability as a council to influence that or is that pretty much done?\nSpeaker 2: So I guess that's my question.\nSpeaker 0: Could someone answer his question? Is it too late for council to weigh in on the appearance of this?\nSpeaker 2: That is correct. There was a ten day period that you could have called it up for review, and that has expired. So I would suggest.\nSpeaker 0: Suggestions the majority of us.\nSpeaker 2: Know.\nSpeaker 3: That.\nSpeaker 5: That trend has left the stage.\nSpeaker 0: A number of days I'm thinking that. I agree. Just to. This goes to, I think why we have to attend planning board meetings and.\nSpeaker 9: To two points. I think what staff member Thomas is getting at is that and as well as the communities that we don't want, I think the term is faux historicism where it doesn't, doesn't in trying to recreate an historic thing, it ultimately fails because it's so phony that that so.\nSpeaker 9: So I understand I understand where the architecture and the planning process has come in with regard to that. But nonetheless, it would be informational and support helpful to the community to understand kind of the theory behind the design.\nSpeaker 9: And let me put it this way. Many years ago, when we did the Walgreen's project on the corner of Webster and and and Atlantic Avenue, you know, there was a theory behind the Walgreens project, we call it, you know, led by then council member Barbara Kerr, who kind of introduced the nautical theme because it fit in with\nSpeaker 9: the you know, with Alameda. But in addition to that, the materials that we used, we wanted them to be kind of consistent with Independence Plaza across the street. So that's why you kind of see the Walgreens project the way that it was.\nSpeaker 9: And this is a long time ago, by the way. So I guess it would be helpful, though, to understand, you know, the theory, the idea that that this design is trying to achieve.\nSpeaker 3: So the new building is meant to, as previously said, speak to the warehouse without trying to mimic it. It makes references to the building primarily through scale. You'll see on the existing warehouse building there are pilasters on the exterior, and those are the structural bays of the existing warehouse building.\nSpeaker 0: Could you put the picture of it so that he can actually refer to the diagram? That'd be great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. So if you look on the rendering there, you'll see these vertical strips and those are structural pilasters. And that's where the trusses and the column lines are on the interior of the building. In that with which is 20 feet, is used as a scalable element in the senior building.\nSpeaker 3: We've also taken the individual panes of glass within the existing windows and use those as a building block for other scalable elements on the senior building. Most notably would be the windows of the apartment units where the moyens are placed.\nSpeaker 3: So that's a big part of it. Another part of it is the massing of the senior building is broken down to have a kind of townhome scale to it, to relate to the residential neighborhood. And you'll see that in the bays and then there's stoops.\nSpeaker 3: And if you look at.\nSpeaker 0: The senior housing building.\nSpeaker 3: If we look at one of the renderings with the perspective. Uh hmm.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, there it is.\nSpeaker 3: Now, that's actually from the private drive, looking at the entry, if we could see one from Sherman and Buena Vista. Okay. But along Sherman and Buena Vista is where we have patios and stoops that the units face onto.\nSpeaker 3: They're not meant to be the primary entries into those units or kind of secondary, but it is to kind of blend in work with the scale, the existing neighborhood.\nSpeaker 5: So just for clarification, what we're looking at is from what direction or.\nSpeaker 3: So this is the northeast corner of the building of a view from the private drive in the master plan, looking at the primary entry into the senior building. So that canopy that you see is a little it's kind of kicking up there.\nSpeaker 3: That is the canopy into the lobby, the entry lobby. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I have a question in regards to the the 24 moderate homes they'll be interspersed. Well, those be available to singles and families or who who will those be available to?\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, that's family housing.\nSpeaker 0: So that's family homes.\nSpeaker 8: Or families for the moderates within that.\nSpeaker 0: Single family. Yeah, right. And regardless of age.\nSpeaker 8: Right.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then.\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, Mayor, just the the affordable housing agreement does stipulate a minimum family size. So the a single person could not purchase a two or a three bedroom. There's a, you know, one obviously one person minimum per one bedroom, two bedroom people, two, two bedroom, etc..\nSpeaker 0: Do you know what the breakdown is? Can you do you remember the 24 units? So.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, I don't. I don't know if Jessica the the you're talking about the bedroom sizes of the 24, right.\nSpeaker 0: That are we we've been speaking about the senior housing, but there are going to be 24 moderate homes within the main building.\nSpeaker 2: I'm Jessica Grossman with Tim Lewis. Communities. The 24 units will be spread proportionately based on.\nSpeaker 6: The size and distribution.\nSpeaker 2: Of units that we'll have in the building.\nSpeaker 6: So depending on how many studios, one bedrooms, two bedrooms, they'll be spread.\nSpeaker 2: Proportionally through the building.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Thank you. Um, okay. And then the. In regards to the senior housing. But this preclude having senior housing at another site that will be coming before us, such as at the Island High site. But this decision today preclude that.\nSpeaker 2: So the the decisions are, you know, completely separate. So I don't think that one would have bearing on the other. We have made physical plans because we've done the design for this site to be senior housing and the both the ordnance and the affordable housing, the regulatory agreement both specify it for affordable senior housing.\nSpeaker 2: So this project is proposed to be senior, but it would have no bearing on other projects.\nSpeaker 0: All right. And also, when I looked at the distance from where this housing would be, the senior housing is actually the farthest in relation to where the. Facil. The public facilities are at the edge. Across the parking lot.\nSpeaker 0: My understanding. So in regards to the parking lot, will there be a way to have those crosswalks protected somehow to make it safe for our seniors to have access to the public facilities within the main building?\nSpeaker 2: And an. Absolutely. When we actually get to the point of doing the construction drawings, we will make sure that they are marked and illuminated to the to make that a safe crosswalk. It's only a driveway. It's not a street.\nSpeaker 2: But you are correct, particularly in the, you know, twilight hours, that it could be a potentially, you know, someone crossing the driveway. So I think we are very conscious of that fact and will make sure that it's as safe as any crosswalk can be.\nSpeaker 0: On regards to. More than likely, we will have a higher percentage of people living there with mobility issues. So that's a concern.\nSpeaker 2: Right. So it's just the two lanes. It would be a Tulane. Tulane Street, not a.\nSpeaker 0: And then also in regards to access to Littlejohn Park, what will we be looking at somehow ensuring that the seniors will have sufficient time to cross that street to be able to access the park?\nSpeaker 8: I'm sorry. You're talking about the crossing. To Jean Sweeney and to.\nSpeaker 3: Littlejohn.\nSpeaker 5: And.\nSpeaker 0: Rochester. So we are especially since we know we're going to be having a senior housing development there.\nSpeaker 8: Absolutely. So we are we can absolutely take care of that. We are building a brand new intersection with a new signal to Jean Sweeney Park. We're also as part of this Del Monte project, re re constructing the Blain of Vista.\nSpeaker 8: Sherman intersection. You know, now, right now it's got a pork chop. You know that three, right? Once Clement is done and the trucks can move to Clement. Then we redesigned and this project's responsible redesign that getting rid of the pork chop that's going to improve for pedestrians that intersection.\nSpeaker 8: And then there's also, as part of this project, an improvement of the crossing from little the other end of little John where there's the pedestrian passed through through the building to Alaska Basin essentially one block. Down Bueno Vista.\nSpeaker 8: So we are already planning on improving pedestrian connections. And of course we will absolutely will make a note of it, make sure that we've got the timing for those signals done appropriately. I just wanted to get back to the design issues for a second.\nSpeaker 8: The design review on this building is approved. It was approved a month and a half ago. There is a there are some final details that are going back to the planning board for another discretionary decision. Colors, if you're a constituent, was concerned about the blue color.\nSpeaker 3: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 8: The materials, final materials. And then there was some discussion. And this slide doesn't really show it about how to treat the actual parapet. There was like there's the flat parapet shown here. There was another parapet that had, you know, how the Del Monte building has those little sort of triangular parapets.\nSpeaker 8: There was a back and forth discussion at the planning board, sort of like talking about the pros and cons of doing something that would. Sort of a stronger reference to the Del Monte building. And the playing board was sort of.\nSpeaker 8: Saying, You know what, let's see some alternatives on that. Bring it back. So I just want you to know, because we 2 minutes ago, we sold, you know, it's final now. It's not the footprint, the size of the building, the basic scale, the building that is final.\nSpeaker 8: But these details that I just mentioned, there will be another hearing. Of course, every planning board decision is you can call it for review. So.\nSpeaker 0: All right, keep.\nSpeaker 8: An eye on that. We'll let you know if there is.\nSpeaker 5: I have a question about the color, because part of what might be a little shocking for we have a screen and we're looking at this at our at the dais. And the blue is kind of like a turquoise blue in this picture.\nSpeaker 5: But when I turn around and look at it up on the the big screen, it reads as more of a silver blue. So I would I happen to like the design and having been a part of the library building team, we did go through that whole argument about, you know, oh, should we try to recreate the old\nSpeaker 5: Carnegie or historic building or something? And I happen to think that the modern rendition we did has worked quite well and has its own classicism. So this doesn't worry me, but the color did, you know, and it may be that if we were to see sample boards that we'd be more reassured.\nSpeaker 8: That's exactly why we require color and material boards, because you, no matter what screen you're looking at or what Xerox copy you're looking at, it can be totally different. So we actually expert. But anyway, I just want you to know, I don't imply that you can totally redesign the building, but there are certain details are still coming\nSpeaker 8: back on board.\nSpeaker 5: Member Ashcraft and this is just in the present day, not in the future. I did want to thank Mr. Thomas or whoever it was on staff because I've been harping about all of the overgrown dry. And I did talk to Miss Johnson about it too, with the overgrown dry grasses and weeds that ran along the point of\nSpeaker 5: Vista frontage and the Sherman side. And I was very pleased that a couple of days ago when I when I drove past, that was all mowed down. So thank you, staff, wherever you are for doing that because we are in a dry season and we want to be safe.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Member Odie I'm sorry, one more clarifying question. So can we go back to the the point the mayor raised about the crossings into the do we have that picture? Are these are these pedestrian only crossings that are going to have a signal or are they.\nSpeaker 8: Let's go. Let's stop. Bob, stop right there. The stop right there. I just. Just to orient everyone. The intersection on the left hand side is. Well, first of all, the top intersection is the brand new intersection. It doesn't exist today, which is going to be the intersection of Eagle Clement and Sherman Sherman.\nSpeaker 8: That's the that's going to be the main entry into Jean Sweeney Park. And it has a new traffic signal. There is then going to be a new traffic signal or a new not a new signal, but a re time signal and a new crossing at Buena Vista.\nSpeaker 4: Vista.\nSpeaker 8: Sherman. And then if you go down Buena Vista, where Stanton right now tees into Buena Vista, right across from the middle of the Del Monte building, new pedestrian crossings at that point.\nSpeaker 4: And then.\nSpeaker 8: At. No, it's at Stanton. Is that us here. Oh. How does how did you do that? Yeah, exactly. Thank you. That's my Vanna White there pointing to that.\nSpeaker 4: So is that so? Is that a signal there.\nSpeaker 8: That's no, it's going to be a pedestrian crosswalk. So we're still designing it. But the idea is because you may remember the way the building is designed, there's going to be a public access easement running right through the inside of the building.\nSpeaker 8: Right. To get people from Little John Park to the Alaska Basin and the Bay Trail, which is going to be right here. So it's got this very cool feature and we really want people to be able to get from Little John Park safely across Buena Vista at this intersection and through the building.\nSpeaker 8: Now, the other crossing that we've been talking about internally is the so that a senior building is on this pad right here. Then if we can go to those that other side real quick and I promise not to bore anybody back on here fast.\nSpeaker 8: No one more back. Right here. So the build the affordable building sits right here. There's a crosswalk across this drive aisle right there. And a second one right here. There's one more slide. Bob, can you go?\nSpeaker 0: And that's also a parking deck, correct? Next.\nSpeaker 8: Stop it.\nSpeaker 4: That's.\nSpeaker 8: So here's the footprint of the Big Del Monte building. There is a crosswalk from the Affordable here, and there's one right here and those are lined up. This is an internal corridor inside the building so a senior can cross the drive aisle.\nSpeaker 8: If it's a nice sunny day and they want to stay outside along the water's edge, there's a path all the way along and a nice big public space facing the water here in front of the commercial, which is these brown areas.\nSpeaker 8: Alternatively, it's a rainy day. They cross the dry veil, enter the building at this internal court, which runs all the way down inside the building.\nSpeaker 0: So will that be a covered crosswalk then for the seniors? Well, it's access the main building.\nSpeaker 8: Or they know how to cross, not across the drive aisle. It's not covered, but it's a 26 feet across.\nSpeaker 4: That's a drive. That's not a street, that's a driver. And so we're not having any any pedestrian only crossings. It's all have to be at an intersection that's already.\nSpeaker 8: I'm sorry I missed.\nSpeaker 4: We're not having any special crossings so there's no pedestrian only entrance into the park you have to cross at the main intersections.\nSpeaker 8: I have just been handed a note. There's a flashing beacon at the crosswalk.\nSpeaker 4: No flashing beacons.\nSpeaker 8: So, I mean, the idea is, you know, so, look, we we want seniors to feel very safe walking. We do. Yes. Building across the drive aisle to the Del Monte building on the waterfront.\nSpeaker 4: So and into the parks.\nSpeaker 8: And then into the park. So crossing into the public, Jean Sweeney Park, they're going to be crossing signalized intersections, going from the from the senior housing into the Del Monte building. And the commercial services are going to be crossing a crosswalk with this flashing.\nSpeaker 4: Beacon magic word. Did Batman give you that?\nSpeaker 8: I don't know. Somebody magically showed up from behind me.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm happy now.\nSpeaker 0: And the story of Jon before I call this public speakers, apparently. Thank you. All right. Our public speakers will be Carey Thompson and then Audre Lorde, Housman and then Art Leonhart. Thank you. I believe we have about ten public speakers.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, I think three times as my record today. But there's a lot of fun stuff going on. I am looking forward to you approving this next phase of the affordable housing piece of the Del Monte Project, because I think other than some of those design things that people seem to have some concerns for that this really\nSpeaker 2: does benefit seniors. I know it's not the entire issue of everybody who needs affordable housing because frankly, everybody needs affordable housing. And but it's a step and I appreciate the fact that we are moving forward with that. And I thank you for helping this process along.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Audre Lorde Housman. And then Art and then Rosemary Riley.\nSpeaker 5: Hi.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Council members. Staff. I also a big supporter of the senior housing and I think the location is great. I think the redesign of the intersection without saying is, you know, absolutely paramount. But what I but it sort of takes me back to is my father lived to 98 years old and I he was\nSpeaker 2: very mobile for the most part. Taylor was about 93. And along he lived in a senior facility. And, you know, one of the key points was keep moving. That's what he kept telling me. He says, no matter what you do, keep moving.\nSpeaker 2: And no matter what mode of transportation they used.\nSpeaker 0: Even if it.\nSpeaker 2: Was walking around the block of the facility, which equaled four blocks, actually that distance to the retail that you brought up is probably much less than that. So I would you know, I think. It's very safe the way it's designed.\nSpeaker 2: That one small street, which is not really a main street, is not a Buena Vista, and it's not going to be that big of a challenge. And I think that access to the what, you know, to the water side, the estuary side is going to keep them out of harm's way.\nSpeaker 2: And with the change in the intersection that Sherman and Buena Vista, I think it would be really good. I would strongly and make sure that all the outside amenities in front of the Del Monte on the estuary side are ADA compliant.\nSpeaker 2: My husband and I uncovered a non ADA compliant bench installed at Alameda Landings Shopping Center and we pass that on to public works and they're taking care of it. But our eyes are so keen now, we could tell right away it wasn't 17 inches.\nSpeaker 2: And but I think that encourages seniors then to come out and congregate and enjoy the amenities that are going to be on on that side. So I would encourage you to approve this and add to the senior housing, which we sorely need.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Mayor Spencer. Members of the council staff. Thank you for your time and patience. My name's Art Lenhart, and I think it's a real privilege to live in this town. I came here in 68, as I've probably told you more than once.\nSpeaker 3: I come from a family that could never afford a house or a car. When I got here, I figured out how to do something for me and my family and get both those things taken care of. Bought a house in 72 and I found out with the house next door to me sold for last month and I\nSpeaker 3: had to take my heart medication. It was rather startling. One of the positions I've held in the past is working with seniors, installing emergency response devices. Matter of fact, I'm wearing mine. Little buttons you wear around your neck.\nSpeaker 3: So if you live alone, as I do when you fall down, you can get help. It's allowed me the privilege to go into many homes of seniors under many different financial circumstances. And I can only say I applaud you're looking at this project.\nSpeaker 3: I'm no engineer. I'm no architect. I'm no color consultant. The idea of the concept of adding this is so essential. And just hearing tonight for the first time and maybe I haven't been reading the paper, there's something going on at the Old Island High Project where even more of this.\nSpeaker 3: Again, good for you. I like this island. I love. That's my home. And I think the people that are here. They're being forced out because they're old or infirm will be given this opportunity. And I thank you for addressing it.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Rosemary Reilly, then Pamela Tozer. And then. And MacArthur again.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. I've been the director for Alameda. I'm Rosemarie Riley. I've been the director for Alameda Meals on Wheels for 25 years, and I fall into that senior category. Now, in my life, I'm really.\nSpeaker 2: On a daily basis here and see the.\nSpeaker 1: Need for affordable housing for our seniors. And I was on the phone this morning with two recipients who are really in trouble in many ways in their lives, including health issues. And they've been on a waiting list for a very long time.\nSpeaker 2: With the.\nSpeaker 1: Housing authority also really pleased with this development that they have really considered our seniors and working with the housing authority is exciting to me because I've seen the work firsthand of the Housing Authority. We have many of the same recipients and they are very thoughtful about placing people, but there's a desperate need for more.\nSpeaker 1: The other thing I was thinking with this particular development, I live on the north side and it's an incredible location for seniors. As Victoria mentioned, you've got Littlejohn Park. You're going to have the beautiful Jeanne Sweeney Park not too long from now.\nSpeaker 1: You can walk down to the water. You've got the shopping center, it's flat. You can walk. I don't know that I'll be jogging down there.\nSpeaker 2: Frank might pass me on the path.\nSpeaker 1: Jogging, as he sometimes does. But it is really a great location. Years ago, many of us worked very hard to turn that. Where Little John Park is now was just an empty parking lot for years and years. We worked very hard as a group of citizens, get approval by the city to turn that into a park, the\nSpeaker 1: only spot in the island that didn't have a park within walking distance. So there's a lot of history for me there and working in that area. And then something I debate mentioning to you, you'll probably see me again because some of you might remember, do you, Councilman Charlie Tillman and Charlie was on the council years ago and\nSpeaker 1: he was the active advocate in the city of Alameda for our seniors. And he would come into the office at Meals on Wheels to make sure I was doing my job correctly, and he would give me a fun, hard time.\nSpeaker 1: Charlie told me in his later years, I want you to watch very carefully, Rosemary, when I'm not doing that work anymore and when any development is proposed in the city. You were to be there and you were to speak up and you were apt to ask the city council members and the planning board to always consider our\nSpeaker 1: seniors. So I can almost hear Charlie channeling to me as I'm driving down here tonight, but that's something I'm going to pay attention to. And you may see me again on that issue, but we had our big fundraiser Sunday for Meals on Wheels well-attended.\nSpeaker 1: People came to.\nSpeaker 2: Have a good time.\nSpeaker 1: But this community is so terrific. They came because they care about our seniors and wanted to make sure everybody got that meal today. So I thank you very much for your time, and I appreciate your obvious interest in watching out for our seniors.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Greetings again. I'm Pamela Tozer. I am delighted with the senior project. I have a mother. She lives alone in San Francisco and rents. She's 75 and still works to maintain her apartment. But it won't be long until she cannot work anymore.\nSpeaker 2: And then she will be in my care. So I'm really excited about the senior project. I also live in the neighborhood of one of us two area neighborhood. And I know that there's been a lot of concern about the parking.\nSpeaker 2: There was a lot of discussion about it at the planning board. I'm not particularly concerned about the parking overflow, but what I do see as a potential solution is having the streets marked for parking to evenly distribute the parking places.\nSpeaker 2: There's a lot of parking where, you know, 1 to 2 more cars can fit and one just sits in the middle. Motorcycle parking, taking up all space. So that's my recommendation for that neighborhood. That would be helpful. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And. And then John Spangler and then our last speaker, Laura Thomas.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening again and thank you for this opportunity. I wholeheartedly support.\nSpeaker 10: This this.\nSpeaker 2: Program and encourage you to do the same. We are in desperate need of affordable housing, and everyone knows that. But one of the things that truly endears Alameda to me and why.\nSpeaker 10: I love having this is my.\nSpeaker 2: Home is we are a community who cares about others and we care about those who struggle and we care about providing.\nSpeaker 10: For them.\nSpeaker 2: So affordable housing in general is something that this is it just is woven into this community, in my opinion. To add on to that, to have a housing area specific for our seniors who really have an have as they age, have even a greater difficulty.\nSpeaker 2: And to be able to know that they have someplace that they can live for this is a worry they no longer have to have, I think is, again, something that is just very representative of this community.\nSpeaker 10: And one of the reasons that I love.\nSpeaker 2: Living here and and enjoy being in Alameda and so, so much. I'll give a little twist on the design. For me, I look at it a little differently. For one thing, the Del Monte is was is a structure that was a business structure.\nSpeaker 2: And as you turn down Sherman and head along, it's really the beginning of what is a new business park. Just kitty corner from this you have the central storage unit, for instance, which is just sort of there. But it again, it almost then eases you into the Wind River and on into the business park.\nSpeaker 2: So it's to me, it's sort of an opening in addition to transitioning into that point. But I think it can be nicely done where it where I think the design has been nicely done. So it really does transition into that part.\nSpeaker 10: Of our community as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening again. I'm John Spangler and currently renter. And I want to say to council and staff and the developer thank you for a very nice project. I have two segments to my comments tonight. First, speaking officially for the Alameda Renters Coalition, Angela hawk about was here at previous meetings to speak in favor of this project.\nSpeaker 3: And we as an organization are still in favor of it. For all the reasons you have heard many times. Summer of 2018 is a long way off, though, for some of the seniors in our group who are looking for affordable housing and to be able to stay in Alameda.\nSpeaker 3: Some of them were on fixed incomes. Katherine Pauling, who just left, is raising her grandchildren here in Alameda, as I believe she has said from this podium. And so she needs something other than a one bedroom. The two teenagers, as you might imagine.\nSpeaker 3: But she's looking forward to the affordable units that are dispersed to the rest of the project to be able to possibly. Hang on to the crowd control issues until the kids are out of high school. I wish you all the best.\nSpeaker 3: Now my personal comments on this project first. Again, I want to reiterate from a personal standpoint, this is a great project and I did a little rough calculation while I was sitting here thinking and I ran it by a couple of people who know far more about housing than I do and what the needs are, because I\nSpeaker 3: can't remember all the numbers that I've seen about what we need. But my rough calculation in terms of order of magnitude. Okay, don't quote me on this as a finished figure. We only need about 100 more of these to meet the demand for affordable senior housing in this city.\nSpeaker 3: So keep up the good work, please. I may be off by 50%. Okay. That's my. That's what I mean when I say. But back to the envelope. But even if I am. 50 times 31 is a lot of units.\nSpeaker 3: Independence was it was 186. So we need at least one more of those. And I also want to say I support the remarks made recently by Andrew Lloyd Houseman and Art Leonhardt, both friends of mine and both people I look to for inspiration and great ideas.\nSpeaker 3: And they've come through again tonight. And one other thought, I think a covered walkway might be worth something. Crossing a parking lot is a long way from a BART escalator. But there are some significant advantages to BART having installed a cover over its escalator on 19th Street for a number of pedestrian comfort reasons.\nSpeaker 3: In addition to the maintenance on the escalators. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Yes. And you are our last speaker, Laura Thomas. Anyone else wants to speak for in your slip, please.\nSpeaker 10: Good evening again. I'm here to support the land transfer that will bring about the construction of housing for low income seniors as a part of the Del Monte project. And as we all know, the skyrocketing rental costs are affecting all levels of incomes and people on fixed incomes.\nSpeaker 10: Actually, along with those on declining incomes, are among the most vulnerable. I believe that Angela Hawk about told me that about one half of the people that contact the renter's coalition for help are seniors. So there is a lot of clamor for senior housing.\nSpeaker 10: Years ago, the call for senior housing in this town, I hate to say it came out of a prejudice, actually, that seniors were mild mannered people who wouldn't cause any trouble even if they were low income while low income families were unwanted.\nSpeaker 10: Period. Now that the new economy is is disposed of so many middle income jobs, I hear a lot more sympathy expressed for everybody at all income levels in this town, which I think is a great improvement. We actually gasp at the thought of paying some of us to own homes.\nSpeaker 10: We gasp at the thought of paying what renters are forced to pay to keep a roof over their head. And yes, we have to build housing for everybody in this town. I want to make a really important point, though.\nSpeaker 10: The building it for seniors should not be done to mollify people who don't like affordable housing, because, in fact, that's an act of condescension towards seniors. We should be doing it because there's a real need and because it's the proper way to treat.\nSpeaker 10: The older generation in this town who looked after us. In this community, I have the utmost faith in both the Housing Authority and Tim Lewis and their ability to carry forth this project. This transfer should be approved tonight because the road to securing funding and building this project is lengthy and there are people who are desperate now\nSpeaker 10: . So please don't hesitate. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. She was our last speaker. Councilor. Comments. Motion.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. I think we're ready to make this motion and I'd be pleased to make. Well, it's actually three isn't it. And I do just want to say, well, I'm pulling up the list of things we have to vote on that this has been a long time coming.\nSpeaker 5: And what have you got?\nSpeaker 8: No, just interrupt.\nSpeaker 5: Just you.\nSpeaker 8: Just four. So the public understands you have this on your dias. It was a minor amendment we added to the affordable housing agreement. It's in the nondiscrimination clause. I just wanted to make sure that was just for public information.\nSpeaker 8: There's a nondiscrimination form, which is a standard nondiscrimination, but we did add a sentence just to because we thought it was important saying, you know, notwithstanding the foregoing, this is going to be a senior housing project.\nSpeaker 5: Oh, well, and maybe just to clarify the foregoing, for those who don't have this in front of you, it the the article talks about the developer covenants agrees that there should be no discrimination against or a segregation of any person or group of persons on a count of any basis listed in another subsection.\nSpeaker 5: But of course, in this case, they have to carve out a little exception because the separate the independent building is going to be age restricted to seniors at a certain level of affordability. So that's what the legalese was there for.\nSpeaker 5: Anyway, I we've had a lot of great comments. I don't think I could do better than the public speakers. This has been a long time coming. I know we have three items to approve, so we guess we take them one at a time.\nSpeaker 5: I will be pleased to move adoption of the resolution approving plan 15-0165a7 lot tentative subdivision map at 1501 Buena Vista Avenue to implement the 2014 Del Monte Master Plan.\nSpeaker 3: A.\nSpeaker 0: Any comments?\nSpeaker 4: Just one quick comment. I echo my colleagues noting that anything we could say is not as eloquent as what was said in the public. And as we look at these housing projects that come before us, you know, I think it's important we focus on the bookends, you know, the entry level for young people that either grew up\nSpeaker 4: here or want to move here or want to stay here. And at the opposite side, the seniors who may want to downsize or who also want to stay in Alameda but can't afford or for physical reasons can't can stay in their home.\nSpeaker 4: So I think it's important we focus on on those bookends. And, you know, I'm very, very pleased to be supportive of this tonight.\nSpeaker 0: All right. I would like to suggest that when it goes through design again, that they look at covering the walkway. I am concerned about the safety of the seniors walking through the parking lot if and make it as convenient as possible and as safe as possible.\nSpeaker 2: Well.\nSpeaker 5: I think I would like that to come back for discussion and the covered walkway. I mean, I don't quite understand protecting them from rain that I, I mean, I guess it can come back to us as some sort.\nSpeaker 5: Well, go to the leave.\nSpeaker 0: It goes to design.\nSpeaker 8: We can take a look.\nSpeaker 0: And.\nSpeaker 8: We can actually take a look on out with each phase of the project. Take a look. We have to sort of figure out trucks and various things. So we'll take a look at it and keep you posted.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: I don't think.\nSpeaker 5: No. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And that was another suggestion I was suggesting. They looked at yes. Or the minister.\nSpeaker 5: Wholeheartedly think yes, we should take a look.\nSpeaker 0: That being said.\nSpeaker 9: Member yes. Thank you. It's important to note that this is a necessary predicate to a lengthy process, the highlight of which occurred in late, late 2014 and 2015. So to remain respectful of that, I think it's imperative to move forward with this project.\nSpeaker 9: There seems to be some kinks that we can iron out, particularly with regard to some aspects of of of design. So I think that I certainly look forward to that. But it's important to remain faithful with that process that began.\nSpeaker 9: So.\nSpeaker 0: I just would like to clarify if the number of units was already approved previously. What's happening now is that we're being asked to address the property issue so that we can have the separate building or the senior housing, which do have a defined as senior housing has to be a separate building, which is what why that's occurring\nSpeaker 0: and why it's coming to us for approval. After. We'd like to clarify that any further. Thank you. All right. That being said, I'm going to call the motion now. All those in favor. I oppose motion carries unanimously at a make you member.\nSpeaker 0: Ready?\nSpeaker 4: I'd like to move. Introduction of the ordinance authorizing the purchase option agreement between the city of Alameda and the Alameda Housing Authority and authorizing the Interim City Manager to execute all necessary documents which transfers 0.47 acres of city owned real property identified as Assessor's Parcel Number 079-0383, Dash 001 and Dash 002.\nSpeaker 4: Located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Buena Vista Avenue and Sherman Street from the city of Alameda to the Alameda Housing Authority for the construction of a 31 unit, affordable senior housing development.\nSpeaker 0: All right. And then I'd like to clarify for the audience that there's actually three separate votes pertaining to approval of this project. Any other comments? All those in favor. I motion passes unanimously. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Next motion on the adoption of resolution approving an affordable housing agreement between the city of Alameda and our partners Sale Partners one LP outlining the requirements to develop 55 affordable units, including the 31 unit Affordable Rental Housing Development on Parcel three at 1501 Buena Vista Avenue, and authorizing the interim city manager to execute the agreement.\nSpeaker 0: Like Mr. Desai seconded. Any discussion? All those in favor.\nSpeaker 3: Of.\nSpeaker 0: My motion passes unanimously. Thank you. And now we're going to take a short break and recess. Well, it's taking a short recess before we resume with item six. The.\nSpeaker 3: Pretty.\nSpeaker 0: We're going to read them. Thank you very much. All right. And we are now on six C, is that right?\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Six C, we've so we had taken 60 out of order.

And we're looking at a rezoning request for 8890 East Lowry Boulevard. The property is in Council District five, represented by Councilwoman Amanda Sawyer. And it's near the east side.\nSpeaker 3: Of the Lowry Field neighborhood.\nSpeaker 0: The property is located south of the Roundabout at Lowry Boulevard and Yosemite Way. The property is approximately 7.2 acres and includes a private baseball field owned by the high school. And a surface parking lot is also on site.\nSpeaker 0: The property is currently zoned R four with waivers, which allows a church, park, school or theatrical studio less than 37 feet tall. The applicant is proposing to rezone to the suburban mixed use of five storey district, which would allow a variety of residential, civic, commercial and industrial uses and the general shopfront.\nSpeaker 0: Drive thru services and drive thru restaurant building forms. The existing zoning, which allows very limited development on the site, is a holdover from former Chapter 59. Adjacent zone districts include B three and oh one, which are also former Chapter 59.\nSpeaker 0: Surrounding districts from the current code include open space as well as community corridor, multi-unit and mixed use of three and five stories. The site is subject to the Loughery design guidelines, which define development expectations beyond the zoning code and address site circulation and parking, architecture, signage, lighting and landscaping.\nSpeaker 0: It's important to note that while the assignment x five zone district allows building heights up to five storeys or 70 feet, the design guidelines generally limit building heights to four storeys in the commercial context, which applies to multi-family and commercial developments.\nSpeaker 0: This means the rezoning would allow a maximum building height of 50 feet, which is 13 feet taller or one storey more than what is currently allowed. The Lowry Design Review Committee is responsible for ensuring these guidelines are met.\nSpeaker 0: As the site is larger than five acres, staff conducted a large development.\nSpeaker 3: Review.\nSpeaker 0: To determine if a large development framework was warranted. Typically, a framework plan is needed if an adopted plan calls for it, and or if future development will require establishing, extending, expanding or otherwise changing the arterial or collector street grid.\nSpeaker 0: An existing regional stormwater system or accessible park open space while the site is over five acres. Staff determined a large development framework was not required as the existing adopted plan. The Lowery Reuse Plan already specifies land use, urban design and transportation goals for the area.\nSpeaker 0: In addition, infrastructure needs for the area are mostly constructed, including the transportation network, open space system, water and wastewater lines and stormwater facilities. Furthermore, site specific issues will be adequately resolved through other regulatory processes, including site development plan review, and the applicant has conducted a community information meeting and additional public outreach, as would be required with the\nSpeaker 0: large development framework process. For context, regarding the immediate vicinity of the site, the areas land use is a mix of public, quasi public, open space office, industrial, multi-unit and single unit use as the top photo shows the of the property, which is a fenced off field.\nSpeaker 0: The middle photo shows the 55 acre Great Lawn Park to the north and the bottom photo shows additional open space to the south. A three storey office building exist to the northeast across Yosemite Street with the Big Bear Ice Arena, which is estimated to be approximately six feet tall and a three story physical rehabilitation center to the\nSpeaker 0: southwest along Lowry Boulevard. Throughout the rezoning process, application notifications have been provided according to code requirements. To date, staff has received three letters from the Lowry United Neighborhoods R.A. documenting their evolving position regarding the rezoning. One initially supported the rezoning contingent on the applicant providing at least 10% of the units at 80% of the area median income\nSpeaker 0: as well as enhancements to the trail along Westerly Creek, west of the subject property and a permanent easement for public use of the trail while the applicant drafted a good.\nSpeaker 3: Neighbor agreement.\nSpeaker 0: Documenting these commitments. Lunt declined to sign the agreement based on additional public outreach and limited capacity to enforce the agreement once current position is neutral. Staff has also received comments from approximately 54 individuals expressing concerns that the rezoning allowing a taller building is too intense for the area.\nSpeaker 0: Redevelopment of the baseball field would reduce open space and obstruct views, and there will be impacts upon the transportation network. In addition, 16 individuals and or organizations have advocated for the rezoning as it will facilitate the provision of senior housing in the Lowry community and will enable the high school to complete capital improvements and provide scholarships and\nSpeaker 0: additional learning opportunities to its students. All comments have been provided to City Council. Although a good neighbor agreement wasn't executed. The applicant and the Department of Housing Stability have finalized a voluntary housing agreement that ensures 10% of the senior housing units will be provided to residents earning no more than 80% of the area median income.\nSpeaker 0: The applicant also intends to identify trail improvements and dedicate a trail easement during the site development plan process. Moving on to the Denver zoning code criteria, it must be found that the requested MAP amendment is consistent with these five criteria.\nSpeaker 0: As a reminder, staff only evaluates the proposed zone district and not a specific development in regard to criteria one. There are three adopted plans that apply to the requested rezoning, including Comprehensive Plan 2040 Blueprint, Denver and the Lowry Reuse Plan, as stated in the staff report.\nSpeaker 0: The rezoning is consistent with several goals in the comprehensive plan, particularly as they relate to providing more housing choices for seniors to age in place and promoting infill development where infrastructure and services already exist. The proposed rezoning is also consistent with the suburban neighborhood context defined in Blueprint Denver as the proposed S.M. X District facilitates commercial development\nSpeaker 0: along main corridors near residential areas. As for the future place type, the subject property is designated as other park and open space which are privately owned parks and open spaces, and as such, their use could change in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Blueprint Denver says that when larger open spaces are proposed to change, this should include a community visioning process. However, staff felt a community visioning process wasn't worn on this site because it's a smaller site, and the Lowry reuse plan already envisioned appropriate land uses for the community.\nSpeaker 0: When contemplating the consistency of the rezoning with Blueprint, Denver staff consider the surrounding future place types, including community center along Lowry Boulevard and campus to the north. Community Center typically provides a mix of uses in larger and smaller scale buildings, with a height up to five stories.\nSpeaker 0: While the campus place type tends to be dominated by single institutional uses and are often multistory. In this context, the SE mixed five district is a good fit for the subject property. The rezoning request is also consistent with the future street types defined in Blueprint.\nSpeaker 0: Denver as Lowry Boulevard is a mixed use arterial and Yosemite is a residential arterial. Mixed use arterials support a varied mix of uses, including retail office, residential and restaurants and buildings are typically multistory. Meanwhile, residential arterials support primarily residential uses, but may also include schools, civic uses, parks, small retail nodes and other similar uses.\nSpeaker 0: The proposed SM X5 district allowing a mix of uses, including residential, is consistent with these street descriptions as it is intended to be applied to areas or intersections served primarily by collector or arterial streets. Looking at Blueprint Denver's growth strategy, the city generally directs growth to key centers, corridors and high density residential areas that align with transportation\nSpeaker 0: options. Nevertheless, limited growth is desired in all other areas of the city specifically 10% of jobs and 20% of housing by 2048. They propose, as a mixed five zone district, is appropriate in this growth area as it will facilitate housing for those at least 55 years old, including an assisted living and memory care facility that will provide\nSpeaker 0: jobs. Furthermore, the proposed rezoning helps implement the blueprints on a policy related to converting former Chapter 59 zone districts to the current Denver zoning code. The proposed rezoning is also consistent with the Lowry reuse plan, which designates the subject property with a mix of three land use categories including residential education, campus and community service, retirement housing and\nSpeaker 0: managed care facilities such as those proposed for within the residential category according to the plan. The intent is to allow flexibility to respond to market demand within a range of acceptable land uses. New construction is envisioned in addition to reuse of existing structures.\nSpeaker 0: The rezoning is also consistent with criteria two, three and five, as stated in the staff report, in regard to criteria for the fact the property retained the former Chapter 59 zoning after the city adopted the current Denver zoning code in 2010 is the most applicable justifying circumstance for this rezoning.\nSpeaker 0: In conclusion, CPD recommends approval of the rezoning request. Thank you, Libby. Appreciate the staff report tonight. Council has received 38 written comments on Council Bill 20 1-1371. There are no submitted comments in favor of the application and 38 submitted comments in opposition of the application.\nSpeaker 0: All members of Council that are present have certified that they have read each of the submitted written comments. Do any members need more time in order to read all of the written testimony that was submitted? Seen none. Council Secretary.\nSpeaker 0: Let the record reflect that all written testimony both in favor and in opposition of Council Bill 20 1-1371 has been read by each member of council and all written testimony will be submitted to the official record of the hearing this evening.\nSpeaker 0: We have 27 individuals signed up to speak and we're going to go ahead and get started. Our first speaker this evening is Matt Overman. And we'll go ahead and have a timer that will show you the last 30 seconds that you have available.\nSpeaker 0: Please go ahead, Matt.\nSpeaker 1: And you guys hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes. And we ask that you introduce yourself for the public record.\nSpeaker 1: Great. Hi, my name is Matt Norman. I'm with United Properties. We are the applicant and developer for the site. We spent the past year here plus working on plans for this site and working with the community's key stakeholders.\nSpeaker 1: Want to extend a thank you to the community for the time they spent in collaborating with us. They've really helped us make this a better project than it was on day one and special thanks to the city of Denver staff, specifically Libby Kiser with planning and Brad winding with hosts for the time they spent working with us\nSpeaker 1: on this project. A couple of key points I want to make as it relates to plans for our site. First, we're very excited to provide to what our knowledge is the first age restricted, affordable rental units in Denver, with 10% of those units as affordable units at the 80% rate.\nSpeaker 1: This site was actually exempt from providing any affordable housing or paying linkage fees due to previous agreements that were in place for Lowry as it relates to affordable housing. But we wanted to go above and beyond, and we heard from the Lowry community that it was also important to them that we had an affordable option with this\nSpeaker 1: development. Secondly, I want to talk about how we're going to be improving the open space experience based on, again, community feedback. We will be adding a public trail easement along the west side of the site, along an existing path that's there but is on private land.\nSpeaker 1: We're also adding site improvements to improve that trail experience along eventually creek. This will protect the trail system connectivity between the north and south side of Lowry Boulevard in perpetuity. Important to note that this site's not public open space.\nSpeaker 1: It's private open space, the field not open to the public. And it was never part of Lowry long term plans that this remain private open space. Third we know there's a lot of existing concerns with traffic and pedestrian activity along Yosemite and the roundabout that have been a focus of the neighborhood neighborhood for several years, more specifically\nSpeaker 1: , the speed with which some vehicles travel through that area. These problems are not a volume problem. They're not significantly impacted with this added development. And Yosemite and Lowry, we're really designed to take these additional traffic flows. So the problems that exist here, our existing issues.\nSpeaker 1: With that being said, we do want this to be a safe situation for the community as well as our residents. We've held meetings specifically with Dottie in East Park on this topic to discuss these issues. We'll continue to do so and we do want to be part of the solution and taking action on what needed improvements there\nSpeaker 1: . Lastly, just wanted to say what a great use this senior living will be for this site. This use applies to so many of the criteria that are set forth in Blueprint Denver and the other plans and those criteria about the they talk about senior living are in place for good reasons on a high level.\nSpeaker 1: Colorado has the second fastest growing population of people over over 60 in the nation. So the need and demand for these types of residential and commercial developments is growing at a rapid pace. Most importantly, you know, our communities give senior citizens a place they can really thrive in their later years in life that provides a community of\nSpeaker 1: people at the same stage of life. And this is really a unique age in place, offering people who live in Lowry and Denver can stay in their community long term. With that, we respect respectfully ask the City Council, approve our application tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for your time and will be available for questions.\nSpeaker 0: And. Q Our next speaker this evening is Marcus partner.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, council members. This is Mark. As partner. I am here for questions. I am in support. I certainly can provide some additional background on the community outreach, but I am here for questions. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Monti force. I believe you're unmuted, Monty. Go ahead, please.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. This is my fourth. I'm the executive director for the Lowry Redevelopment Authority, and I'm here only this evening, not in support of or against. Just to answer questions about maybe some of the historical background that might be necessary or questions that might come up.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Phil Workman.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. Good evening. So, Workman 130 Rampart Way, Suite 225. I'm a Lowry resident of 18 years. Also a proud matchbox parent. Match up is a. Or your high school that has a diverse population of students throughout the entire city, every council district in the city and county of Denver.\nSpeaker 1: We conducted a community outreach for the proposed rezoning where we conducted over 35 community meetings and many more individual meetings with neighbors and stakeholders. These include small group meetings as well. Specifically, one East Park neighborhood. Larry Business Alliance.\nSpeaker 1: Larry Design Review Committee. Larry Redevelopment Authority. Although we are still dealing with COVID, we have some of the meetings in person and a majority via Zoom. Those virtual meetings were also made available for review by the community. We utilize social media, physical posting of the property, certified mail and social media, and a combination of certified mail and\nSpeaker 1: fliers as well, and a combination of all of those. And I will admit, sometimes that is still even that is an imperfect side. One of the basic tenants of our outreach strategy or outreach strategy has always been to listen and to respond to the concerns of the community as best as we can, and also to enable a\nSpeaker 1: process for open communication, not only during the rezoning, but throughout the entire development process in response to the concerns we heard throughout this process. We have addressed community concerns regarding affordable housing, parking, trail accessibility and collaboratively working with the Lowery community and existing issues with traffic and safety.\nSpeaker 1: And in response to these, we might we are looking to memorialize these agreements, and there will be some discussion here and the future of how we are going about to memorialize those agreements and those things that we have heard as concerns of the community as part of this process.\nSpeaker 1: Every step of this process has been done in a thoughtful matter with the community in mind from the formulation of the RFP by the Archdiocese and selection of United Properties to the library design review process to the community outreach process and responses.\nSpeaker 1: And with your support this evening, we look forward to move to the next process, we have already said, for the Foundation for Ongoing Community Engagement. Thank you very much for your time and we would appreciate your support this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Kaylee Robinson.\nSpeaker 3: I am just.\nSpeaker 0: Here to answer questions. Would you mind introducing yourself for the public record? Keely Robinson Norris.\nSpeaker 3: Design 1101.\nSpeaker 0: To be an extreme. All right. Great. Thank you. Our next speaker is Dana Hoffman.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. Good evening, counsel. This is Dana Hoffman. I'm with the Denver Department of Transportation Infrastructure. I'm on the community design team. I'm just here to answer some questions that may come up around transportation projects in the area. Thanks.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. Our next speaker is Marco CAVANAUGH. US. And I believe Marco is joining us via telephone this evening. If I'm not mistaken, our producers have Marco's phone number that they can look for. Or Marco, if you want to hit Star nine to raise your hand, we can get you moved in.\nSpeaker 0: Right. And doesn't look like I'm seeing Marcus in the queue right now. And so we're going to go ahead and move on here. Next, we have Norman Schwab. Norman, please go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: I am Norman Schwab. I reside at three, two, three Altman way in Denver. I speak on behalf of 80 East Park residents who signed and submitted public hearing testimony on January six. My comments are drawn from that letter.\nSpeaker 1: We are opposed to the zone. It s2fm you five. We ask the city council one to postpone the recent decision until the developer in residence can resolve the intensity of use, location of uses, buildings and design compatibility to remand the case to city staff to consider the less intensive SMU three zone.\nSpeaker 1: Given that a floodplain designation, high water table and utility easement constrained development on portions of the site and because surrounding land uses, the existing zoned designations are less than ten, including height and three removed the good neighbor agreement referred to in the Zone Report from the record.\nSpeaker 1: The developer put this forward, but the Lowry United Neighborhoods Board has not agreed to it. The height allowed by the reason would lead to extremely intensive use of the developable portions of the site. The high water table prevents underground parking.\nSpeaker 1: Recent developments along Lowry Boulevard is three stories in height. Single family homes along Yosemite way are two stories. Zoning along Lowry Boulevard and nearby is a mix of SW in U five, SMU three and other zones. Most of the zoning limits heights to three stories.\nSpeaker 1: East Park residents particularly oppose a large four story parking garage putting up against the neighborhood on Yosemite Way and the Sports Boulevard entrance to the regionally significant Lowry Sports Complex Park. What other large park in Denver has a four story parking garage at one of its major entrances.\nSpeaker 1: Are there any other four story parking garages in Lowry? We believe the answer to both questions is no. The parking garage would create a dead zone for pedestrians and bicyclists on the existing Yosemite sidewalk, an important connector to valued open space and recreation.\nSpeaker 1: It is not compatible with Lowry plans and design guidelines to minimize the impact of parking on neighboring properties. Lowry has been planned as a walkable, well-designed, pedestrian community. Recent multifamily developments in Lowry have ramped housing units around parking or put it underneath residential units.\nSpeaker 1: That is not so here. The location and visibility of the parking garage is problematic. The developer has said that it cannot be located elsewhere on the site. Please postpone a decision on this rezoning and remand it to staff for further review.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Norman. Our next speaker this evening is we're going to go back to Marco Cabana. Where was Cabana was. Go ahead, Marco, please. And you're going to have to unmute yourself.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. This is Marco Cabaniss with Duty Transportation and engineering supervisor for the Transportation Review Team. So we work in partnership with CPD and and arrange for for the concept plan to get around through the department so that it gets all the, the eyes on it that we want to do a thorough traffic and transportation review.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm here to answer questions tonight.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Very good. Thank you, Marco. And we're going to go ahead and move back to our list. Paul Brandus.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, city council members and happy New Year. My name is Paul Venice. As an introduction, I served on Denver's Expanding Housing Affordability Committee, as well as the Board of Lorrie United Neighborhoods. R.A. But to be clear, I am here not to represent either organization.\nSpeaker 1: My opinions are my own. My family has lived in Murray for six years. We live about one mile away from the site in question. The affordable housing crisis is extremely important issue for me. Our family actually moved to Denver from Boulder six years ago, partly due to skyrocketing cost of living in Boulder.\nSpeaker 1: I believe that the unaffordable housing prices in Boulder are that mostly due to restrictions that the municipality has placed on new development. Denver's population has exploded. Murray needs to contribute to this solution with new housing units that this development will provide.\nSpeaker 1: Murray also needs a commitment to long term affordable housing for our community that the free markets otherwise wouldn't provide. I'm proud to live in Murray Plan community, where the development of income restricted housing has been a cornerstone of our legacy.\nSpeaker 1: Mandates for affordable housing are part of the origin story of Lowry, as they were core provisions in the sale of the Air Force base to allocate homeless housing units back in 1994. When I first heard about this development here in Lowry, a group of us raised the issue of ensuring that provisions would be made for allowing low\nSpeaker 1: income housing units. The developers are receptive to feedback and have worked with hosts to negotiate the affordable unit agreement that you see today. For that reason, I am here to speak in support of the zoning request and believe that it meets all criteria as the developer shared their plans for the property.\nSpeaker 1: Many voices of opposition to the rezoning and project have come forward, mostly from immediate neighbors who are concerned about traffic views and density. While we may want to point blame to the developer for the developer for not appeasing nearby neighbors, I believe that the root cause of the opposition is due to a broken zoning application process that\nSpeaker 1: does not require site plans to be submitted in conjunction with zoning applications. The reality is that no one here actually knows the design of the site that will be ultimately built. This is a result of the system of the city has in place, not the fault of the developers.\nSpeaker 1: That said, the one unique thing to us here in Lori that lets me sleep at night is the fact that we do have a unique ability to control the design of the site design plans. The Lowry Community Master Association is our home and has a Larry Design Review Committee that is comprised of community members, architects and landscape\nSpeaker 1: architects to utilize a four phase process to evaluate proposed plans. I believe that the Larry Design Review Committee will hold the developer to the high standards that they have held all developers to, and that Larry's voice will be protected and amplified through the Audi RC as it relates to traffic concerns.\nSpeaker 1: My understanding of recent studies show that traffic speeds and pedestrian volume volumes that did not warrant additional interventions. I do urge you to continue to monitor the traffic condition of the site. Thank you for your time and for the opportunity for us to make a small dent in the affordable housing crisis and approve this zoning request.\nSpeaker 1: Best wishes to you and your loved ones. See you next time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Paul. Our next speaker this evening is Ryan Padilla.\nSpeaker 1: Hello? Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you for your time. I'm here to speak against the rezoning to a mixed five. I personally believe the the site does not lend itself to a high density use. The sewer easement that runs through the property makes it very difficult for the site design to be flexible.\nSpeaker 1: The floodplain issues on the property in the high groundwater table, if you develop it at a high density, it's going to lead to a large parking garage being required. And having a four storey parking garage in front of a park is an eyesore for the neighbors.\nSpeaker 1: It's going to. It's I agree with what someone said earlier about the dead space being created along that sidewalk along Yosemite way. And I believe the pedestrian safety. I live at 500 Yosemite way and I have to walk across the roundabout to the bus stop.\nSpeaker 1: And going in and having traffic coming in and out of the new complex is going to be very dangerous, especially in the winter. I just having a four storey development on that site is not a good idea. I'd urge the Council to reconsider a lower density development due to the site constraints that will not involve a massive\nSpeaker 1: parking garage right in our neighborhood. I think that will be a for my time. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Morgan Spencer. Hold on one sec.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry. Okay. Hi, I'm Morgan Censor. I am a library resident and I am speaking in support of the rezoning.\nSpeaker 0: I have two children.\nSpeaker 3: In preschool here in LA and I enjoy the opportunity to take advantage.\nSpeaker 0: Of all of the carefully planned.\nSpeaker 3: And balanced parks, open space and everything the library reads about the Library Master Association provides.\nSpeaker 0: I think that this proposed development.\nSpeaker 3: Is perfect to use without putting in more multi-unit apartment buildings. I wish this resident was residents was open ten years ago for my grandmother who is looking for senior residences and had to go down the Highlands Ranch. And as I continue to grow my family here in Lowry, I think about my parents and having them close by\nSpeaker 3: and just having this sort of opportunity in this neighborhood, I think would bring a lot of wonderful experiences and not monetary wealth, but wealth to the neighborhood. So I thank you for your time and supporting this rezoning effort.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Megan Brady.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. My name's Megan Brady. I'm a resident of the East Park neighborhood in Lowry here. I live just across the street from the proposed development on Yosemite Way, and I am here to oppose it for a variety of reasons.\nSpeaker 3: I know Norman and Ryan touched on this earlier with the high water table preventing parking beneath the property for residents, which is not in line with the surrounding design of the Lowry neighborhood. As somebody who will be looking at this every day directly at the parking garage, this is a huge concern for me because this is not\nSpeaker 3: why I moved to the area. I think this will also significantly decreased property values on our side of the neighborhood. The sewer easement in the middle prevents the property from being able to put the parking in the middle to wrap the building around the residences around.\nSpeaker 3: So again, just limiting the options they have there and in the floodplain on the side of the creek prevents them from building too close to that side of the property, which means this development will be right up against Yosemite Way.\nSpeaker 3: Adding this number of residents to the neighborhood will significantly increase the density of cars and pedestrians throughout the area, which I think will increase the danger and hazards of an already hazardous intersection due to speed and density. So I am again asking the Council to oppose this rezoning request.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Jarrett Lehrer Way.\nSpeaker 1: All right, I. Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: I thank you. I wanted to share there a way. 1300 south to the streets. I am. I actually work for the Denver Archdiocese. And this is a project that I've been working on for a bishop bishop matchup of high school.\nSpeaker 1: I wanted to thank the council and committee members and the public for allowing me to speak this evening. We started this process nearly two years ago where we met with the CMA and other stakeholders in the community and asked them questions on what would be a good benefit for the community.\nSpeaker 1: Because we the the baseball field is underutilized. We only use it for practices in the spring. It's very expensive and some games and games for the Loughery baseball team, but it's very expensive to maintain. And the school, which is going on 15 plus years old now, needs significant upgrades in its infrastructure.\nSpeaker 1: So we decided to pursue a rezoning and selling of this property through an RFP process based on the feedback that we received from and Mary and the stakeholders and the community prior to ever engaging any developers. We had ten developers who submitted on this project and we chose the United Development Team due to their their concept of\nSpeaker 1: providing senior housing for the community. Because a market study shows there is actually a need for senior housing and living and aging in place and in this community. We thought that it would be the least impactful to the community based on low cars and traffic counts.\nSpeaker 1: It would also provide jobs because there will be some support with the development's senior assisted living as well as, you know, living, independent living. And we also felt there was a great need for Bishop Match Path High School.\nSpeaker 1: With the money generated, we could do the much needed infrastructure improvements and provide scholarship opportunities to our students. I think Phil had said this before, but knowing we had 200 plus students that come from all over the Denver metro area, but also in every district in the city of Denver, it's a very diverse student body.\nSpeaker 1: We also have almost nearly half the students are on some type of scholarship or assistance. So this money would be greatly needed for this for this, for the needs of match both. And I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood having worked in and around the Lowry neighborhood on different development projects for over 20 years\nSpeaker 1: . Thank you for your time and I thank you for your consideration. And I hope that you support this this redevelopment, this rezoning request.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Chad Crean.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. My name is Chad Crane and I live at 470 Yosemite Way. I'm opposed to the rezoning of the area, to the zoning that they are requesting. I agree with Norman that it should be looked at as possibly the lower zoning, where it would limit the density of what could be built on this site for the reasons\nSpeaker 1: , again, that have been mentioned, the flood water plane, the amount of density that will bring more traffic, although people seem to say it won't we that live on the street can say with very honest and true opinion that it will bring more.\nSpeaker 1: And I have some concerns about the safety for people that will be at the park and people that will be living at this center with having a structure on this large on this spot and site. I think that I do commended that they are looking to do this for senior living opposed to other multi-unit housing or apartments\nSpeaker 1: , but I feel that it should be postponed. On making this vote or change until there is better clarification of exactly how this site will be laid out, especially to with the garage site being four stories. Again, as people mentioned, there is nothing else in Lowry that is four storeys high for a garage site for this kind of\nSpeaker 1: use. If we're going to have something here, let's make it something that blends in with the neighborhood and the surrounding area a little bit better. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker has been ro henninger. Monroe. You'll have to go ahead and unmute yourself. Monroe HENNINGER. Go ahead, please. Are you there, General?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Go ahead, please.\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. My name is Monroe Manager. I live at seven, six, nine, eight East seven Drive and Lowry in the North Lowry Development. I've been there for over 20 plus years. I'm in support of the rezoning of this for a couple of reasons.\nSpeaker 1: First, firstly, right now it's a private ballpark. So none of the Lowry residents have access to any of the land or the land surrounding it. My understanding is that with additional trails added to the neighborhoods surrounding there, that.\nSpeaker 3: We will have.\nSpeaker 1: Additional places where the whole community can enjoy some of the open space there. Thirdly, as you know, a son in law who's had a.\nSpeaker 0: Father in law in.\nSpeaker 1: A nursing home and had to travel great distances every day to get there. And a lot of the residents and Lowry having parents that are reaching the age where a nursing home would be necessary. I believe that having a closest is important.\nSpeaker 1: And so I'm in full support of this. I hope you do, too. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: And you. Our next speaker is Stephanie Crane.\nSpeaker 3: Everybody hear me okay?\nSpeaker 0: Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: All right. Good evening, council members, and thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight. My name is Stephanie Crane and I'm a 12 year resident of East Park. I live it for seven years now anyway. And I will be able to see this new development from my front porch.\nSpeaker 3: So it's very near and dear. But tonight, I want to focus on the density of this development. In a letter that was dated May 19th, 2021, the developer requested that the LaRouche Design Review Committee approve a variance allowing our buildings to exceed the 45 foot height restriction by up to five feet, to give them the flexibility with\nSpeaker 3: the final dimension and design of their buildings. I think it's important to note that this now a 50 foot building height that they're requesting, would not include mechanical screening. A building of this height does not fit into the landscape of the East Park neighborhood.\nSpeaker 3: This parcel of land is currently a baseball field, as many have said. To the far end of the large sports park at Fairmont, and Lowry is a one story office building that houses the Colorado Department of Public Health with ample surface parking lot.\nSpeaker 3: It would seem out of place to have a 50 foot building as you enter into another residential neighborhood and park. In addition, a building of this magnitude designed to butt up against the sidewalk would provide little to no snowmelt, causing an increase of icy road conditions at an already unsafe roundabout and adjacent sidewalk that's used daily by\nSpeaker 3: pedestrians, runners and cyclists. The developer has also asked for an increase in parking spaces a lot in one and a half spaces per unit for the adult. I'm sorry, the active adult rental and 0.8 spaces for assisted living and memory care.\nSpeaker 3: But to me that seems odd that this development would need these additional spaces, given that they have repeatedly stated that many of their senior residents have either downsized to one car and rely on public transportation, or that the memory care residents are not allowed to drive or even own cars.\nSpeaker 3: So the current parcel of land already has a significant amount of surface, lot space and mature trees that will now be removed to accommodate this large four storey above ground parking garage. We are told that this development will be between 260 and 300 units.\nSpeaker 3: Seems like the largest Colorado project for assisted living and memory care. I guess my question is why does this have to be so massive given what we know about the parcel of land? We know that there are constraints doing the flood plains, high water table, sewer easement.\nSpeaker 3: Our biggest concern is this four storey above ground parking structure that will sit right along Yosemite Sports Boulevard. All other parking structures in Florida seem to be two stories within a commercial area of the neighborhood, and they're either underground or wrapped.\nSpeaker 3: And this doesn't seem to be the case for this particular structure. We do understand that loan land zoning changes occur and we're not against this particular development, but it is extremely severe and it doesn't fit within the current landscape of the community.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm just asking you to please reconsider what you plan on.\nSpeaker 0: Allotted for each speaker. We're going to go ahead and move on to our next speaker. Leo Nyholm.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I have to go. Good evening. My name is Jarrell Nyholm. I live at 8031 East Bay Avenue. I've been a resident for a little over five years. Thank you for your time. And I would like to express my support for the project.\nSpeaker 3: As an architect and a resident. I am fully in support of a variety of types of resident residential and uses. Excuse me, in the neighborhood. And I believe that the senior living is needed. And I think it's perfectly located because it's close to transportation and it's close to parks.\nSpeaker 3: And in addition to that, I fully trust, I think it was Paul that mentioned the Larry Design Review Committee, and I fully trust their professional standards as residents or as additional opportunity for input. And I believe that that particular process hopefully will address the concerns of some of the residents have.\nSpeaker 3: That's all I had. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate it. Have a good night.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Julie Zimmerman. Okay. It looked like we had Julie in the queue. Well, there we go, Julie. Julie Zimmerman, we'll have to have you go ahead and meet Julie.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry. Can you hear us?\nSpeaker 0: I'm sure I can hear you, Julie. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Please. Thank you so much. Thank you very much for having us. Meaning we appreciate all of you. I I live at 520 Yosemite way. We are the second home in from Yosemite and fifth avenue. So we were the second home essentially built in this part of Larry East Park.\nSpeaker 3: And we live across the street directly from this new build as it we very much oppose the development of this. And I would like to show that primarily people who are in support of this do not live in East Park.\nSpeaker 3: As far as open space, there is one block of open space I think is very important that the city council understand that it is one block basically that they are seeing. The developer says that they will make this wonderful place.\nSpeaker 3: It's not a huge area. It's a block. You can come and look at it within by you. It's beautiful, but it's not a big space. I think it's an area in which they are willing to acquire some development, productivity and money to do this.\nSpeaker 3: As far as a senior community, there was one closed at Lowry Boulevard, which was replaced recently with, I think, alas, I don't know how you say it, Alice or Glass or whatever in that multi unit rental property is.\nSpeaker 3: So it seems to me very much this is about money. Finally, as far as community outreach, primarily they reach out to people within 200 feet of this building. We are the second closest home to this property that is being proposed to be built up by Matt and his associates.\nSpeaker 3: And we received a flier, as they say, but due to work, we're unable to make that meeting. But they did not. They, despite what they say, there has not been a big outreach as far as traffic and the decrease in travel between those 55 and up.\nSpeaker 3: I will be 55 on Saturday and I have a 13 year old, so I travel plenty and I have parents who are approaching 80 who live in East Park as well, not with us than in a different single home unit.\nSpeaker 3: And they travel all the time, including picking up our children because we both work as far as multi residential to the woman who commented on this is a good use. There are 300 plus units scheduled to be on this.\nSpeaker 3: So thank you to you as a preschool teacher. I so appreciate you. I can't even tell you how grateful I am, but this is not a good use of a property directly across from our home. As far as match clubs we agree, we support Match Local.\nSpeaker 3: We have a son who went to Regis. We agree in the tradition of that type of education. But I will tell you that other people can purchase can purchase this property.\nSpeaker 0: Truly, that's the time we have a lot of outreach. Speaker We're going to go ahead and move on to our next speaker, Greg Ryan.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. Good evening. This is Greg Ryan. I'm in support of this rezoning. I've lived in Lowry for a little over five years now. I moved here in 2016. I first lived off of Lowry Boulevard for about four years, and then earlier this year moved a few blocks north at 1028 Tamarack Street.\nSpeaker 1: So still a little bit further north. You know, I appreciate the opportunity to live in the city and county of Denver's place is great, really. You know, there's a lot a lot of good stuff going on here. There's a diversity of housing mix in Lowry, and I like that.\nSpeaker 1: You know, I formerly lived in like a condo and now I'm in a more of a single family home. So, you know, I do appreciate the diversity housing mix and the addition of a senior living residence is perfect for the mix of Lowry and kind of the southeast Denver neighborhood or, you know, just part of the city\nSpeaker 1: . So I hope you can join me in supporting this project. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Scott Zimmerman.\nSpeaker 1: I know that.\nSpeaker 0: We can, but we might need you to mute another device there. Scott, I think we've got an echo. Go ahead and try it again.\nSpeaker 1: Sorry about that.\nSpeaker 0: There you go.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Is that better?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I also live at 520 Yosemite Way. And I just wanted to echo a lot of the points that have been made in terms of opposition to this project. I would reiterate that there was a previous senior living facility to the west of where we live and to this proposed development that failed and went under.\nSpeaker 1: And we also currently have one senior living development called Brookdale, which is in the Lowry Central area. So I'm not entirely sure why we need a second facility. I think that I would reiterate that a lot of the people that are really for this don't live here and will not have to see this every day as they\nSpeaker 1: drive by it, or just look out their front porch to see this kind of monstrosity of a four storey parking building. I think that the development plan is a little bit disingenuous when they talk about specifically Matt Warman community outreach because we received one flier over the course of two years and other people have talked about social\nSpeaker 1: media and other community notifications, but a lot of the notifications were through the LC or the Lewellyn and other redevelopment properties which we have no stake in or ability to receive notification. I think that this is an ill conceived project and I think it's being kind of rammed down our throat.\nSpeaker 1: We understand the plight of Matchbox, but there are other people who will be willing to purchase this property for other mixed use development that doesn't result in the current plan. I have not seen any reference to the Dotti study on traffic, so I can't really comment on that.\nSpeaker 1: And I was actually quite surprised that they said it's not a really big deal because I witnessed this traffic every day. And I think that the overwhelming sense of the community is that we have not been included in this, irrespective of the developer's notifications or at least attempted notification.\nSpeaker 1: We didn't really hear about this whole thing until I think, Oh, there was a flier in May and then we had a meeting back, I believe, in December, and that was the extent of their notification. So as you can tell, I'm not in support of this.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Scott. Our next speaker this evening is David Andrews, and I believe David is joining us via phone. And we're going to go ahead and get a manicure. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead, David.\nSpeaker 1: My name is David Andrews. I'm a resident of Lourey and I want to support this project and the proposed estimates. Five reason. First, because it provides jobs which are so needed these days it sits on arterials, so its traffic impacts should be de minimis.\nSpeaker 1: Despite other assertions. It's consistent with the reuse plan with Blueprint Denver. It provides affordable units. And as a former employee of the Lowry Redevelopment Authority, I can tell you that this was always private, open space and never in the calculus to remain open space throughout the master planning.\nSpeaker 1: In addition, there's the old CRC, which is going to ensure that what, however the site plan moves forward, it is responsible and fits within the context. In short, I support the project. Thank you for your time this evening.\nSpeaker 0: And cue our next speakers, Jesse Paris.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Good evening, members of Council.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. My name is Justin Paris. The number of positive for black stocks and more for self defense positive Mexican mafia social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and the East Denver Residents Council front frontline black males and I'll be the next November 2023.\nSpeaker 1: This rezoning is very alarming. It actually hearkens back to the Dennard rezoning. I haven't seen this much opposition since then. 54 letters of opposition, 38 letters in opposition presented to this council. Oh, so much to go on with this.\nSpeaker 1: 300 plus units at 80%. Am I the. And am I level $68,592 as of 2019? We have a housing crisis, an affordable housing crisis, and this is not going to help with that. I'm all for housing for seniors.\nSpeaker 1: I'm all for allowing seniors to age in place. Those are wonderful things. But this rezoning, I don't think is going to get the mark. I really don't. Like previous speakers have already stated this just on a flood plain on a water table, 10% of the units are going to be affordable at 80% AM-I I'm still trying to\nSpeaker 1: figure out how that's affordable, but that's based off the hood guidelines. Yeah, it's just all around. But I wouldn't be surprised if you pass this tonight, seeing as you passed the marble rezoning a few months back. So I wouldn't be surprised, but I would recommend that's not passed.\nSpeaker 1: And go back to the drawing board with this. I had a few questions in regards to this rezoning. Has there been a traffic study done because of pretty previous speakers have stated that this sits around a roundabout several roundabouts.\nSpeaker 1: I'm aware of only one RTD bus route that services this area now would be the six. Has there been a parking study done on the standards? It's going to be a four story garage space here. There's no way for there to be underground parking because it's on a floodplain.\nSpeaker 1: Um, how many units? One of the speakers said it was going to be 300 plus units. What are going to be the size of the units? Are they going to be one or two bedrooms? This is going to be assisted living or is this going to be independent senior living?\nSpeaker 1: If somebody could please answer those questions, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next up, we have Cathy Head. Hi. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: I'm Cassie Head and I'm co-chair of our United Neighborhood Line.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks for giving us a chance to speak tonight. I want to summarize kind of our involvement in this project from.\nSpeaker 3: The time that we were originally.\nSpeaker 0: Contacted by the developers. And we're not.\nSpeaker 3: Taking a stand either pro or an opposition at this point. Lower United Neighborhoods has been in discussion with the senior housing development team, including Matt Oberman.\nSpeaker 0: And Phil Workman. We were originally contacted.\nSpeaker 3: And sat in on our project presentation in March of 2021.\nSpeaker 0: And followed by three meetings with the One committee. One urged that active.\nSpeaker 3: Living apartments include units for lower income residents, including public access.\nSpeaker 0: Along.\nSpeaker 1: It.\nSpeaker 3: Along the east side of Westerly Creek.\nSpeaker 0: Benches and trees for that path and that a publicly.\nSpeaker 3: Accessible pickleball court be.\nSpeaker 0: Considered.\nSpeaker 3: The senior housing team has agreed to the 10% low income.\nSpeaker 0: Units to the project. The lower income rentals are to be codified in agreement with Host. An easement along the path phone can be held by Lowry Community Master Association or the City of Denver. On October 21st, one hosted a town hall presentation.\nSpeaker 3: Via Zoom for the Lowry Community. Community current.\nSpeaker 0: Concerns expressed during.\nSpeaker 3: The October 21st presentation included vehicular site.\nSpeaker 1: Access.\nSpeaker 0: Pedestrian safety and traffic.\nSpeaker 3: At Lowry Boulevard. Just some of the traffic circle and along a summary loss of greenspace preservation of existing mature trees.\nSpeaker 0: Building height Lowry design guidelines limit to a.\nSpeaker 3: Height of 45 feet.\nSpeaker 0: And potential parking conflicts.\nSpeaker 3: Along Sports Boulevard through two follow up meetings on December 2nd and December 7th, which included city staff.\nSpeaker 0: It was determined that the pedestrian safety and traffic.\nSpeaker 3: Issues will be addressed through the.\nSpeaker 0: Ongoing monitoring by JT.\nSpeaker 3: And Site Plan Review. Once the city receives a development package, the Lone Board determined after the October 21st community meeting that.\nSpeaker 0: It does not have the capacity.\nSpeaker 3: To seek a sufficiently representative vote from.\nSpeaker 0: The R.A. community to either express or withhold support for this rezoning. The board also determined that rather than executing agenda.\nSpeaker 3: The provision of lower income housing and the path right of way can be achieved through host agreement and an easement with the City.\nSpeaker 0: Of Denver.\nSpeaker 3: Or the LACMA. One appreciates the conversations prepared with United Properties team as well as multiple conversations with city staff.\nSpeaker 1: And submits this.\nSpeaker 3: As a record of these interactions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you for your time. Thanks. Thank you. Our next speaker is Christopher Schenk.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Can you hear me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Excellent. My name is Christopher Shank. I reside at 460 Yosemite Way. I'm eight houses down from the proposed project and. I think most of what has been said tonight is very spot on from those who strongly oppose this project going forward.\nSpeaker 1: I don't think anyone here is arguing the merits of the project. I think we all think this is a wonderful idea and it's a very good idea. However, this is a horrible place for it to happen. I'd like to reiterate the point from earlier.\nSpeaker 1: Speakers of those who speak in favor are not the people who will be directly impacted by this on a daily basis. They are not the people who drive by here every day. They are not people who walk their children to the park every day.\nSpeaker 1: They are not the children who walk their pets in this area every day. And I would go so far.\nSpeaker 0: As to say that most people.\nSpeaker 1: Who have spoke in favor.\nSpeaker 0: Have a financial.\nSpeaker 1: Issue with either gaining from the property itself or scholarships through the school. We're being told here the traffic will not increase or if it will, it won't be that much. I would really like to know how the addition of 300 extra residents plus their families, plus their friends, plus the employees who will be at the site, will\nSpeaker 1: not add traffic and safety issues to an already unsafe area. I myself have been involved in two fender benders in that roundabout at Yosemite and Lowry Boulevard. I think that this is not irresponsible use of this site and it is not consistent with the neighborhood nor the neighborhood of East Park.\nSpeaker 1: I have to iterate again that we as a neighborhood do not feel that there was sufficient community outreach, despite what the developments development the proposed developers have said. Those of us who live on Yosemite, very few of us had any idea this was happening until the rezoning meeting.\nSpeaker 1: We're talking about public health, safety and welfare, and I cannot see how increased traffic in this area with no plan that's in place is going to support that. So I'd like to say that I am strongly opposed to this process.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our next speaker is Steve Zigler.\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead. You hear me? Okay? Yes. Okay. Great. My name is Steve Ziegler, and we've been Larry since 2004. My wife and I have three kids, and we also own a business, a radio and a space, actually right across the street from Ashcroft High School.\nSpeaker 1: This is not going to impact us financially, positively or negatively simply. And if we to grapple with the concerns of the traffic and its impact on our neighborhood. Thank you, Councilwoman Sawyer, for working with me and our neighbors on those issues.\nSpeaker 1: Much like the East Park neighborhood, our house borders preexisting traffic concerns. Super, super frustrating. It's certainly gotten worse over the years. That being said, this property is not open space. It's its property that's going to be developed. And I feel like what's being proposed is perhaps the most advantageous use for our community outside some sort of police\nSpeaker 1: substation. But I. I would like to see this pass. We are for it. I'm supportive of senior living, and I think it's a good mix. Overall in Lowry Southeast Denver. I do trust and believe in the Lowry Redevelopment Authority and everything that things will come to an agreeable solution.\nSpeaker 1: So I hope you join me in supporting this project. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: In. Q And our last speaker this evening is Blair Licht and Phil. Go ahead, Blair. Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Larry, looking out of the addresses for 10/17 Street Street.\nSpeaker 1: 2210 Colorado Street across the.\nSpeaker 3: Street.\nSpeaker 0: Claire, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but for some reason, your audio is really garbled. I wanted to see if if you try again. I know you don't have your camera on, but go ahead. Okay. Dr.. A little bit.\nSpeaker 0: We'll go ahead and try it again. Go ahead. Okay. Is that better? Yes, I think so. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: I would like to make reference to that certain letter from me on behalf.\nSpeaker 0: Of the applicant to the.\nSpeaker 3: Members of Council dated January 1st, 2022, and to ensure that my letters entered into the record for tonight's public hearing. The letter outlines in detail how the applicant's request for rezoning.\nSpeaker 0: Of the subject property meets and exceeds each of the criteria for approval of rezoning.\nSpeaker 3: As established by the code. By way of an update to the aforementioned letter, I wanted to let Council know that the applicant.\nSpeaker 0: And current owner of the.\nSpeaker 3: Property.\nSpeaker 1: Bishop Bishop.\nSpeaker 0: High.\nSpeaker 3: School, have agreed on material terms for a community commitment agreement between those two parties which obligate the allocated use for things. First, to enter into the agreement to provide affordable housing in favor of the city of Denver, obligating the applicant to make 10% of the residential units and the active.\nSpeaker 1: Adult building available.\nSpeaker 3: To private residents. 80% or less of area median income. Second to work with neighbors, the city and body to strategise.\nSpeaker 1: With respect to.\nSpeaker 3: Mitigation measures intended to alleviate or remedy existing traffic conditions on the Assembly and Barry Boulevard. Third, to provide a public open space easement in favor of the city.\nSpeaker 1: On.\nSpeaker 3: Over and through the existing Westerly Creek Trail.\nSpeaker 1: On the.\nSpeaker 3: Property, which easement will include an application of.\nSpeaker 1: The property owner.\nSpeaker 0: To.\nSpeaker 3: Improve, provide and maintain benches and other amenities along that trail. And finally, to pursue.\nSpeaker 1: Opportunities.\nSpeaker 3: For publicly available recreational.\nSpeaker 1: Programing.\nSpeaker 3: On the property subject to city approved. Otherwise, I'm here tonight to answer questions about any of the agreements the applicant has entered into or has agreed to enter into with.\nSpeaker 1: Respect to.\nSpeaker 0: The application.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you in advance.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I'd like to thank all the members of the community who joined us tonight for the public hearing. That concludes our speakers. We're going to move to questions from members of Council on Council Bill 21, DASH 1371.\nSpeaker 0: Council Member Sawyer.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks, Madam President. I really want to just first thank the community members for coming out and speaking on this issue. It was really helpful to identify a number of the questions that I have for tonight. So to start, I want to ask about the current zoning on the property.\nSpeaker 3: So Libya, I think maybe this is a question for you in terms of or possibly if Monti force is still on, I believe it might be a question, a historical question for the LRA, the LRA Redevelopment Authority, but wondering how so?\nSpeaker 3: So first, Monti, when what year exactly was the the Lourey community and all of that property conveyed from the U.S. Air Force to the city of number?\nSpeaker 0: And Monty, if you go ahead and reintroduce yourself for the public record before you respond.\nSpeaker 1: This is Monty Force. I'm the executive director for the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. My address is 130 Rampart Way. Denver 80230. And again, I'm not justifying for or against in just offering any. Historical perspective that I can help with, and I might be fuzzy on some of the facts.\nSpeaker 1: It's been a while since this property was conveyed. The property from the Air Force to the Redevelopment Authority for implementation into the master plan was done over a number of years, starting all the way back to 1994. So great.\nSpeaker 3: No, that's great. So so in general, what I was asking was, you know, when did when was the Library Redevelopment Authority, I guess instituted and what? And so my follow up question to that is, what was the property zoned as back then when in its original form?\nSpeaker 1: When the property came to Denver from the Air Force, there was it wasn't zoned. All of the zoning had all the property had to be zoned into Denver.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, okay. Great. Thank you. So so I guess follow up question to that and maybe I'm not sure if you're the person to ask about this or not, then the current zoning on the property is ah four. So when the property was conveyed from the Air Force, was there a discussion about what the, what the zoning was\nSpeaker 3: going to be. Because we re zoned city council resolved all but 20% of the city in 2010 into the new zoning code, and this property stayed in the old zoning code in the Chapter 59 zoning code. So I'm wondering, was that a a specific decision that was made at that time of conveyance?\nSpeaker 1: No. The Air Force, first of all, wasn't involved in the zoning process ever. And often times we tailored zoning to meet the intended uses that we were selling the property for. So the words Bishop match above may have come to us.\nSpeaker 1: I don't recall the details exactly asking to put in a ball field. So then we looked for zoning through our zoning consultants to come up with his own district. That would satisfy that need.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. That's good to know. Thank you. So. So the current zoning on the property is ah, for which allows for today a senior living facility to be built on the site. So I'm I guess a little I'm trying to unwind them.\nSpeaker 3: The issue of is that is that the waivers that that then ensure that it that we have to go through this rezoning. I guess I'm I'm trying to get the background on that.\nSpeaker 1: I think I'm probably the wrong person to answer that question.\nSpeaker 3: I think.\nSpeaker 1: Differently.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's what I'm happy to answer. That's okay. This is Marcus Pok near 4700 East Sixth Avenue. I am a consultant to the applicant. Mr. Foresman is correct that oftentimes when LRA did transfers, they would put a deed restriction on the property and then find the appropriate zone district.\nSpeaker 1: So, Councilwoman, this is zoned for today. I'm looking at the ordinance in front of me. It's a 1998 zoning on this subject property, as Libby mentioned, at the very beginning. It allowed, again to reflect that this was transferred to an educational use.\nSpeaker 1: We waived out, which is traditionally how we did things in the early days of Lowri. We waived out all of those other uses except for those educational things. So a church, a school or a theatrical studio could still be on the site.\nSpeaker 1: And as Libby said, at less than 37 feet tall today. So that could happen today. There are restrictions on that. And Councilwoman, you are correct in the existing are for an old chapter 59. Senior housing is a permitted use and a house assisted living facility is a use by special review.\nSpeaker 1: So that has always been contemplated. I would also mention just quickly that in that Lowery reuse plan, as you saw and was noted in the presentation, it also showed that senior housing is allowed in that Lowery reuse plan always envisioned for this use at that site.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Great. Thank you. I really appreciate that. So the so I guess follow up question to that for Libby. You mentioned that blueprint. Denver has identified this parcel as a future use open space. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 0: That is the current future place type. But the plan acknowledges that that applies to large, private, open spaces that are likely to turn over due to their private nature.\nSpeaker 3: Got it. Okay. And then is anyone from Parks and Rec here? I would love to just ensure that, you know, is Parks and Rec going? Is there a plan? Or would Parks and Rec be willing to purchase this land for open space for the city of Denver?\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: We do have a representative here, Kathleen, but Becky should be on. If we can promote her.\nSpeaker 3: Kathleen, if you could just hit the raise hand button, maybe so that they can find you in the ten and ten these lists. That'd be great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: All right. There you go, Councilwoman Kathleen.\nSpeaker 3: Hey, Kathleen, thanks so much for being here. Really appreciate it. I just want to reiterate my question in case for some reason, you were not able to hear it while you were getting switched over. This would be a lot easier to do in person, I think.\nSpeaker 3: But just want to confirm, is the is Parks and Rec willing to purchase this land for open space use for the city and county of Denver? Kathleen Levesque with Denver Parks and Recreation and Denver Parks and Recreation has not had any conversations with the property owner about purchasing this land and does not have any intent to purchase\nSpeaker 3: it. Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that clarification. So then let's so open space. Matt, maybe you can answer this question for me. It seems like we have sort of a discussion ruins here or a disagreement between the Lowry reuse plan and Blueprint.\nSpeaker 3: Denver.\nSpeaker 0: What is Blueprint Denver?\nSpeaker 3: I guess what was your sort of take on that in the application?\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for the question, Councilwoman Sawyer. Um, I, I guess I would reiterate what Libby said on how it is designated for private space and future use, that it can be turned over for private development. I think we're we're very we're very much in line with many of the criteria and blueprint.\nSpeaker 1: Denver, you know, as it relates to the context of of other surrounding designations there, if you look at the future place and street types in the future neighborhood context, they call out for community center suburban neighborhood context. I mean, those are all good fits for for what we're planning here and for this senior living use.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Great. And Matt, while I've got you, I just want to also confirm. So you do you have a signed agreement with host that you will dedicate 10% of the of the spaces or the units to affordable at 80% am I.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, we signed it. Host doesn't sign it unless the reason becomes formalized. But yes. And Brad, I hope Brad's on. He could speak to that as well. Host If you would like to see.\nSpeaker 3: It, looks like Brad just raised his hand. Perfect. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: And while we're waiting, Brad. Yeah, I think we're waiting for.\nSpeaker 0: Going to get him in here. There we go.\nSpeaker 3: Hey, Brad, thanks for being here. Just wanted to confirm with hosts that that agreement is signed, sealed and delivered.\nSpeaker 1: Confirms we have it executed by the winner in our contracting system for authorization on our side if and when the rezoning is approved.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, great. Thank you so much. And can you please just introduce yourself for the record?\nSpeaker 1: Sorry. Hi, everyone. Brad wanted staff for housing stability or host the city and county of Denver.\nSpeaker 3: Perfect. Thank you so much. Really appreciate that. Okay, so there were a few issues that were identified. There was the sort of disagreement between Blueprint and the Lowery reuse plan with regards to the future use type. Libbi, when when blueprint when there is a neighborhood plan because there are many neighborhoods in the city of Denver where there\nSpeaker 3: is no neighborhood plan. What does Blueprint say about which one controls the neighborhood plan or blueprint?\nSpeaker 0: The neighborhood plan typically controls.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So in this case, then that does that mean that the Lowery redevelopment plan, as put in place when all of those parcels were transferred over, is the controlling document that we should be looking at here.\nSpeaker 0: Correct? Yeah. Usually with our analysis.\nSpeaker 3: Whenever there's a neighborhood plan.\nSpeaker 0: Like, for instance, if blueprints on Bruce's five stories are appropriate and a neighborhood plan says three stories is appropriate.\nSpeaker 1: Usually we would go with the.\nSpeaker 0: Three stories that's in the neighborhood plan. So typically we defer to that smaller area plan that had kind of more targeted input from the public.\nSpeaker 1: Then Blueprint Steinberg, which was a citywide process.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, great. I appreciate that. I just want to you know, as I'm going through the criteria that we are, the five criteria that we're required to look at, I want to make sure that I understand, you know, whether this is consistent with the adopted plans, because we have two adopted plans that are potentially not in line with\nSpeaker 3: each other. Right. Okay, great. So the so the neighborhood plan is what's going to what's going to guide us there and the neighborhood plan. Can you just refresh my memory on what the neighborhood plan says for this this parcel?\nSpeaker 0: The neighborhood plan calls for a mix of uses and that include residential education, campus and community service. And within that residential category, retirement housing and managed care.\nSpeaker 3: Facilities are specifically listed. Okay. Great. Thank you. Really appreciate that. And then the the open space section. This may be another question for you. So you can you explain to me the easement and what's happening? Tell me more specifics about what's happening there.\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So a couple of things. So there's an existing trail that goes along the west side of the site along Westerly Creek. Unfortunately, that trail is on private land. The land that we are, we are purchasing. It's been used as a public trail.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know for how long, but it's so it's being used that way. So one of one of the ask through the community outreach was, can you can you put a public trail easement over this, which will protect effectively forever protect this trail to actually be a true public trail.\nSpeaker 1: And it provides great connectivity there between a bunch of the trail system that's on the South and a bunch that's on the north. So we will be doing that as part of this. And the bounds of that easement and exactly where it falls will all be flushed out through the process that we go through with with the\nSpeaker 1: city there. And then in addition to that, through the again, through the community feedback, we're going to be enhancing that trail experience. You know, no specifics really on what that would be. We've talked about at adventure that trees but you know making that a better trail experience there along Westerly Creek that will now be a public trail\nSpeaker 3: . Okay. And then I believe someone mentioned briefly pickleball courts. What is what's that?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So that was another thing. Through the feedback, they requested that we tried to put a publicly accessible pickleball court there, which we do plan to do if we do run into any.\nSpeaker 3: Issues there.\nSpeaker 1: With with noise issues, that that is our just our one concern. We would figure out something, something else to put there. That was it was less noisy but was a publicly accessible recreational activity. So that was something that was asked of us and that we will be doing with this development.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then so that is I appreciate that you have stated your commitment here at the rezoning hearing on the public record. Is there signed paperwork on that?\nSpeaker 1: There is not currently, as I think Blair's Blair stated, we are doing a community commitment agreement that we're now working through with Matchbox. You know, the history there of the Jena was spoken about by a few folks. And, you know, we we drafted that in plan with Lorne at one point.\nSpeaker 1: And unfortunately for us, we we just found out recently here that that, you know, wasn't that they were not capable of of of reviewing and executing that. So we did reach out to a couple other entities. LOWRY Redevelopment Authority, the.\nSpeaker 1: Lowry Community Master Association, you know, looking to find another party to do a put on that agreement. Unfortunately, those folks also didn't have the the ability to do that. So we are drafting an agreement that will show that with with Matchbox, who is the seller of our site, and we'll be there in the community there long term\nSpeaker 1: . And so the other, you know, but the other mechanisms that are in place there, as you mentioned, the critical piece, the affordable housing, right. We have the agreement with host and the trail easement, the trail improvements. Those can can be handled through the process as well as the publicly accessible recreation activities that we'll put on the site\nSpeaker 1: . We can handle that all through the process. The Denver.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Great. Thank you. And the the parking lot. So we heard a lot of comment from the public about the parking lot. Can you talk me through that?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sure. I mean, the site plan is something is definitely still in flux, having been through the SDB process yet and in a in an effort to be open with the community and get feedback, you know, we're showing them some very early plans of what we we have planned for the site.\nSpeaker 1: And I think in the most recent one we showed, we have shown a four storey above structure or above ground, part of the structure at the corner of Sports Boulevard and Yosemite. That that plan, while it is still in flux, it has not been done in a vacuum.\nSpeaker 1: Folks here have mentioned the Lowry Design Review Committee. We've been through several conversations and iterations of that site plan with them, working with them to see what their thoughts were on best ideas for where to locate an above ground structure here.\nSpeaker 1: So I think it's it's it's a little bit premature on the on the conversation there. You know, I will say, I know people are concerned about looking at a parking structure, you know, that will be screened again. LOWRY So lucky in that they have these gatekeepers that protect the architecture of.\nSpeaker 1: LOWRY And, you know, this these further steps will take in the process. They'll be there to enforce the Lowry design review guidelines that have dictated everything that's been built there. Lowry.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Great. Really appreciate that. And I will just say, as an aside, I think there was a speaker earlier who mentioned the way the process works. And I want to just make sure that it's clear for all of the residents and the public what we're talking about here.\nSpeaker 3: So the the rezoning process happens first and then the site development review process happens second. And so as council, we can only look at the criteria that we're allowed to look at in terms of rezoning. But it's good to get an idea of some of the feedback that the community has had for you and some thoughts about\nSpeaker 3: that. And it's good to know that the design review board in Lowrey is has very specific requirements and that you're in conversation with them as well. Okay. So then I want to ask a question of, I guess, one of the representatives from Dotty about the traffic.\nSpeaker 3: This is an area that my office has spent a significant amount of time with the police department and with Daddy working on. And so I know that there was a community meeting. I was not there because as a quasi judicial role that I have in this rezoning to vote yes or no, I can't I couldn't be there\nSpeaker 3: to hear the discussion. So curious if I can get a report on the conversation and what may have come out of that in terms of potential mitigation of the issues?\nSpeaker 0: All right. We've got Dana Hofmann ready to answer that question, Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. Deena Hoffman again. Department of Transportation Infrastructure. I'm the community designer for this area. Councilman Sawyer, I can speak to that meeting. So we did have a meeting with the East Park community. It was hosted by LUHN. And the intent of that meeting, just for the record, is was to talk through existing transportation issues, not issues very\nSpeaker 3: specific to the potential impacts of this rezoning and redevelopment. In terms of the meeting content, so some of it was just hearing concerns from a community about transportation in the surrounding area. I would summarize that as primarily speeding safety issues within the traffic circle there at Yosemite and other traffic circles and excuse me, roundabouts there and the\nSpeaker 3: other roundabouts in the area. And then also some requests for additional crossing treatments. Dottie has looked into some of these concerns prior to that meeting and also subsequent to that meeting and some of the concerns we've heard more recently brought up by this development.\nSpeaker 3: One of the changes that will be coming as a result of that additional analysis are some safety improvements at the roundabout there, and those will primarily be done with signage and striping, and it will better clarify essentially which lane assignment cars will be entering into making sure that folks are traveling at an appropriate speed as they enter\nSpeaker 3: into the roundabouts. I have the draft work order available, which I can share with council if you'd like. There are just minor modifications being made to that before it's approved and it goes out. So that's probably the most significant change that's being made at this point in response to community concerns.\nSpeaker 3: We are going to look at some additional crossing treatments. There are none that are approved at this point. I hope that helps. Yeah, that was great. Thank you. Really appreciate that information. And, you know, oftentimes when we have a development like this, the developer makes a commitment to do a traffic study during the site development review plan\nSpeaker 3: and potentially even make some upgrades or enhancements to to the, I guess, the roadways, the travel ways outside of but adjacent to the development. Has anything like that happened here, Dana? Do you know or maybe Matt, maybe you can speak to that.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Dana, go.\nSpeaker 1: Ahead. I guess I'll go ahead, Dana.\nSpeaker 0: But we'll make sure to hear from both of you. So, Dana.\nSpeaker 3: Matt may want to speak to this and Marco also could speak to this as well. So we don't have any specific commitments from the developer, although, you know, we've definitely heard interest and doing best interests for the neighbors.\nSpeaker 3: What I am aware of is that some a traffic study would be conducted once the development was ongoing. Some specific requirements we've asked for if that traffic study was done. So so Marco could speak in more detail about what they would have to look at moving forward.\nSpeaker 3: But there aren't any commitments at this time. Okay. Great. Matt, did you want to jump in? Thanks, Dana. Did you want to jump in and fill out some some of that information further?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. I mean, I'll just reiterate that we want to be part of the solution here and we want it to be safe for our residents as well as the community. Right. So certainly we were doing a full traffic study through the typical process here in Denver for through the ACP and the civil design.\nSpeaker 1: And it's expanding the scope of that to collect some more data points to to help Doddy come up with ideas or solutions here. I mean, we're definitely open to doing that and we want to be a part of the solution here and see how our development could help alleviate some of these concerns.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, great. And so is there have you committed to I guess it's hard without a good neighbor agreement based on the inability of any one particular organization within Lowry to have the I guess, the ability to do a good neighbor agreement.\nSpeaker 3: Have you committed to that in some other way, or what does that look like?\nSpeaker 1: Not at this time other than obviously, you know, we're here saying it now on public record that we want to be a part of the solution. And and, you know, we're going to be long term members of this community.\nSpeaker 1: So we want to be a part of that. We we spoke to the the agreement with Matchbox that we're working on. So that's an avenue we could potentially take there. But I guess that's yeah, we're we are still working through that.\nSpeaker 1: So.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, great. Appreciate it. I've got a few other questions, but I know that there are a couple of other council members with their hands up in the queue. So I'm going to step back and let them answer their questions.\nSpeaker 3: And then if my questions are not answered based on the things that they ask, I will pop back into the queue. Thanks, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. We're going to go ahead and go to Councilmember Flynn.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Madam President. I'll be brief. I just have one question. I need a clarification. Libby, can you tell me, reading through the staff report on this five story, three story, the existing zoning allows three stories. The request is for a five story zoning, but the Lowry design guidelines limited two apparently to four stories.\nSpeaker 1: And so I'm a little concerned why we selected the SMU five rather than the SMU three with waivers to four stories, rather than just giving a blanket entitlement to five stories. When we did Loreto Heights, we did SMU three along along federal, but with a waiver to allow up to five stories.\nSpeaker 1: And so why what is the mechanism in the rezoning that we're being asked to vote on tonight that would guarantee that it will not be five stories, but it will be, in fact, limited to 50 feet.\nSpeaker 0: I appreciate the question. It is a rather convoluted story with what's existing and what's allowed with the some X viruses. LOWRY But the Lowry Design Review Committee will be reviewing this in tandem with the site development plan process.\nSpeaker 0: And so any development within this area is going to have to meet the design guidelines and go through that review process, which would limit the building to four stories slash 50 feet. So that is the mechanism.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Is there a mechanism within the Lowry? That's that's all the way on the other end of town. I don't get out that far all that often. So I'm just curious, is there anything in the Lowry design guidelines process that allows it to be changed down the road?\nSpeaker 1: In other words, that we're we're letting loose. We're being asked to let loose an entitlement for five storeys, 70 feet. Could those design guidelines change down the road as early as this design review on this project prints, for instance?\nSpeaker 0: And that is a really good question. I do know that they did have a older version of design guidelines, and the one that they have now is only a couple of years old. And some of their terminology and some of the ways that they're addressing things have changed.\nSpeaker 0: But I don't know how much like they're. The design guidelines themselves and height limitations have changed.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so I understand, you know, things change. Times change. This was 1994. Could Marcus Parker maybe address that? That Marcus, you were there at the time. Can you tell us what is the process with the design guidelines and how how can they be revised or would they be revised within the life of this project?\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. And Councilman, I just want to stay on record again that all the RC we've actually already started and going through that process and LOWRY And so this site actually going through it is already capped at that 45 feet that we talked about.\nSpeaker 1: It's interesting, Councilman. It kind of is somewhat out of order the way it happens there. But we actually and that's why the community knows a lot, if you will, about the suggested parking garage and so forth, is because there is this process.\nSpeaker 1: So, Councilman, we have gone through there as to your question. There may be a way somebody mentioned that you didn't get a variance for some of the structures on the roof, but all across. LOWRY There is a height limitation.\nSpeaker 1: And, Councilman, that has been true. The only thing I read, though, is that existing buildings like the hangar immediately to the west of us is 67 feet. So the big bear ice arena, which is right there, is actually something that's higher than that.\nSpeaker 1: We certainly will not get there. So, Councilman, we will stay at that 45 feet. Okay. Thank you. I think the hangars were there long before ABC, long before the people were there. That's right. Thanks. Thank you, ma'am. That's all I have.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Marcus, for the public record, would you please introduce yourself?\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Marcus Park, near 4700 East Sixth Avenue, consultant to the developer.\nSpeaker 0: All right, great. And prior to you, we had Libby Kiser, our community planning and development planner. And so thank you, Councilmember Flynn. We're going to move to Council Member Sandoval. We're going to have to have you a new councilwoman.\nSpeaker 0: For some reason, we're not hearing your audio. Okay. We're going to go ahead and see if you can work on that or if we need to have you leave the meeting, councilman, and bounce back in. We can certainly do that.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Cashman, do you want to go ahead and go ahead with your questions?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, thank you. Just one quick question. Whether it's from Marcus or the developer, if there's someone there.\nSpeaker 2: That can answer.\nSpeaker 1: I'm I'm just wondering, a lot has been made people concerned about the view of the parking garage. We see a lot.\nSpeaker 2: Of developments.\nSpeaker 1: Now and now a days where the parking garage is wrapped by the residences.\nSpeaker 2: Is is that an option? Has it been.\nSpeaker 1: Considered? Just wondering. Yeah. Councilman. All this joker. Marcus Falkner consultancy. The Development. We have started that process. As I mentioned, the DRC. We will have to go through the full step and want those neighbors, particularly the neighbors immediately across the street to be involved in that.\nSpeaker 1: So, Councilman, we did show some massing and I think, frankly, that's what shows brought those comments forward. I think that massing we will go through that architectural review and talk about screening all of that. I would note that someone who's been involved in Lowery a long time, councilman, this is a wonderful thing that we're dealing with, is\nSpeaker 1: actually parking structures immediately across the street. It's a very large parking field. And that really leads to kind of something that I don't think is the the type of context that we want to develop today. So we are working through those challenges.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman, I guarantee you those neighbors will be involved. Lowery has a great process that that LDR. So, yes, sir, there are some slight limitations on that, that low water table. But we will work through those issues with the neighbors and find the proper screening.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you, Marcus. Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Next up, we have Councilmember Sandoval.\nSpeaker 3: Can you hear me now?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I had to tell the woman the technical difficulties. The matrix is in the computer. So I don't know who this question will go to, but when Larry was built out, how much affordable, affordable housing was developed with this master plan?\nSpeaker 1: So, Councilman, I'll defer to Marni Fauci if he is still on. One thing I will note if he's maybe getting promoted is that we were subject to the original Ice Age ordinance, so we had inclusionary housing throughout the site.\nSpeaker 1: We greatly exceeded LRA, greatly receded that 10% limitation. So, Councilman, there was an agreement for all of Lowry, including Boulevard one, which is the last phase that was developed on the west side of Quebec. So this subject property, if you will, Councilwoman, was already subject to that agreement, to a preexisting agreement.\nSpeaker 1: The neighbor said that's not enough. We frankly agreed with them. We said we wanted to go further. And we believe this is the first senior housing deal that actually has a deed. Restricted affordable housing agreement in place with host.\nSpeaker 3: So you're saying what I hear you said was like 10%. So 10% of housing. So including single unit homes, single family homes, 10% of apartments. Because I know Central Park had like a specific master plan where they had a portable housing developer.\nSpeaker 3: Who was your affordable housing developer?\nSpeaker 1: Councilman, I'm sorry again, if I'm blind and don't know if money force can answer it. So you let me jump in.\nSpeaker 0: Monte is on so we might take it over. And Monte, if you want to introduce yourself for the public record.\nSpeaker 1: Marty Faust. I'm the executive director for the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. And the. Affordable housing for all of Lowry was entered into? Well, first of all, there was the I show. We negotiated a 200 units of for sale units.\nSpeaker 1: It was in that plan. But overall, affordable housing amounts to about 800 units in Lowry between rental housing for formerly homeless and for sale units.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And that was that. Thank you, Marty. And that was throughout the redevelopment of the whole entire project, is that correct? Right. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And then who is your affordable housing developer? Is it same as the developer who built everything? And then were they restricted? Or can you explain that process a little bit?\nSpeaker 1: It's a fairly complicated but the um we the for sale housing was developed by a land trust. It was not deed restricted. It was a land trust, the Colorado community land trust to develop those properties with help from the Lowry Redevelopment Authority as to affordable housing for the formerly homeless.\nSpeaker 1: That was done through the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and some other force or for rent developers as well as we required certain developers when they were developing property to include affordable rentals in the program. It goes to multiple developers.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, I hear you. I got that. Thank you. And then a comment was just made. And inform us who are as familiar with the whole Lowry development. It was said that during the site development plan that there would be participation by the public.\nSpeaker 3: That doesn't happen in northwest Denver. If a project gets rezoning and a site development plan goes through the process. It's between the community planning and development development services more specifically and all of the processes that go through a site development plan.\nSpeaker 3: So for those who are watching this, Lowry have a different site development plan that people can actually participate in.\nSpeaker 1: Who answered this in part. And that is the Lowery Community Master Association has oversight of the Lowry Design Review Committee, and I'm sure that they post their meetings and projects on the website as they're going through the process.\nSpeaker 1: It'd be better directed actually to the Lowry Community Master Association because they actually now control the design review, that is the community design controls to review it.\nSpeaker 3: So I understand her design review process. I'm just I'm just confused on how it keeps being said that the public who are on here, who have talked in opposition can be part of this site development plan is I just don't understand where there's a trigger that would have public participation in the State Department then.\nSpeaker 3: Can someone on the team help me understand.\nSpeaker 0: That.\nSpeaker 1: It's all in the what I site I can. Sorry Matt. If you jumped in Marcus partner again, what I cited was exactly what Marnie Faust just mentioned, the elder C Lowry Design Review Committee. Those are public meetings, Councilwoman, that are posted for members of the public to be able to attend.\nSpeaker 1: And they have a process that goes through that. There's public comments that would be allowed, Councilwoman. And I'm sorry, I don't know if it's at the beginning of the end of the meeting. That is a process, one of the processes that we've already started going through, and they had a public posted meeting and where they allowed that\nSpeaker 1: to happen. And we will continue to go through that process.\nSpeaker 3: For the Site Development Fund. And so when you do the site development, spend the whole entire site development spend, so the traffic, the water, wastewater, all of the things that have to be checked off on the site development spend that's posted through this.\nSpeaker 1: RC Yeah, I think their purview is a little less right councilman than the whole councilwoman and the whole ACP, but all of the elements that are within their purview will be available. I think what we're offering to do and we have done throughout, is to continue to communicate with those neighbors.\nSpeaker 1: So, Councilman, we're happy to to share some of those details, give updates at the age of the RC process. Lowry is known, as you say, for a little bit of a different process where that is a much more open and involved process that will go through on the site plan.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. And Libya, I have a question for you. So although this is been asked for five story entitlement, did I hear correctly that this whole area has a height cap at 45 feet, which I think is under five stories.\nSpeaker 3: So even though they're going asking for an entitlement of five stories, they can't build five stories. Is that is that what I'm understanding?\nSpeaker 0: It is correct. Yeah. Sorry that that's confusing.\nSpeaker 3: But per the DRC process.\nSpeaker 0: They had their design guidelines that max height at four stories. And I do believe that the applicant's team is actually pursuing 50 feet instead of the 45 feet. That's typical, but that is still significantly less than the 70 feet that would be allowed with the five storey s-max.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. That's I think that's a that's a valid point for this hearing, is that although they're asking for more entitlement, that there's already a cap at 45 feet, can one someone from the development team. Is it are you going to 50 feet?\nSpeaker 3: Is that including all of the equipment on top of the building, the back and the elevator shaft? Or are you going 50 feet plus the age back and elevator shaft?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, this is metformin with native properties, but we're certainly not far enough along the design process to know exactly what the heights will be. But let me add some clarity on the 50 feet. So we did go through a height variance process, a public process with the DRC to go from 45 to 50.\nSpeaker 1: And the reason for that is you really you really can't even fit a four storey building with a flat roof and 45 feet. So we made that case to them as well as it allows us to do more articulate architectural articulation along the roofline.\nSpeaker 1: Right. Going up and down, you know, things that make it look like not one big massive block. So that was really the reason for the 50 feet as it relates to mechanical screening, mechanical penthouses. Yes, that is outside of the 50 feet.\nSpeaker 1: That's how they've written the Lowry design review code. But you know, those the goal is right to set those back into the middle of the roof. And and you'd have to be standing a pretty good distance away to see those.\nSpeaker 1: But those are not within that 50 foot 50 foot restriction.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I have one question for you. One last question for you. I keep hearing public comment about the water table. Have you or has your team done study that indicates the water tables higher over in this neck of the woods than it is in other places in Denver.\nSpeaker 1: I can't I can't speak to how it compares to other places in Denver. But, yes, we do have a relatively high ground water table here. You are right next to Western Leigh Creek there. Right. So I think that's part of it.\nSpeaker 1: I'm not a geotech expert, but yes, we do have some areas on that site that seem to be higher than we might typically see in Denver.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you, Madam President, first of all, for my questions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And we're going to go ahead and move to Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Some of my questions have been asked, but I did want to ask a couple that have not been asked. I heard some reference to other senior living, one that I don't know if it existed and then went away or\nSpeaker 0: they had applied for the zoning to do it and it never happened. But Marcus, I see you on there. How many senior living projects are on the Lowrey property?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Councilwoman. So just for clarification, there was a senior housing development that was just about the equivalent of four or five, maybe six blocks to the west of the site that went away because, councilwoman, that was a facility that came from the Air Force, had very aged facilities.\nSpeaker 1: And interestingly enough, when that went away, it became a very intense multi-family development. So that became a much more intense multifamily use. There is councilwoman and existing senior center right out of callback that has a facility there. Matt and his team are experts in this.\nSpeaker 1: They did a very detailed analysis, market analysis of the site, and there was a remarkable need for senior housing. It's actually reflected in the equity analysis in an ad that went through the zoning and really looked at this was very much needed.\nSpeaker 1: So we would believe that this is actually a very beneficial use and a very needed use at this site.\nSpeaker 0: So the market analysis wasn't just of the Lowry community. It was of the broader age population that needs affordable or needs senior housing, but includes the 10% that's in it. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: That's correct, Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then I wanted to get. The. Lowry folks back on. Because I had a question about the. So the design review process that you talked about with Councilwoman Sandoval. So that was that was to ensure that all the new buildings coming in met that criteria.\nSpeaker 0: But for the ones that were assumed because some of these properties were of gifted, if you will, to some of those nonprofits. Correct. Monte, are you on? We do have to go.\nSpeaker 1: Ahead on muted now. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So so the properties that were gifted to nonprofits and this was back when Councilwoman Polly Flowback was the councilwoman of this district. And I remember her and Cathy Reynolds going to Washington and asking for $5 million to assist because there were more nonprofits that had.\nSpeaker 0: Basically applied for some of those existing buildings. And Marcus just talked about one of them that just went away. Right. But. Some of those nonprofits were given money to go do their projects elsewhere as opposed to on the the Lowry property.\nSpeaker 0: But for those that did remain. Did they have to go through or if they do upgrades in the future, will they have to go through the design review process?\nSpeaker 1: Very good memory from those days. Yes. The design review. Just a couple of questions there. But first of all, the design review process holds for any past development that has already occurred and also applies to anybody that is going through the process now for redevelopment of a site.\nSpeaker 1: We anticipated that there would be redevelopment of properties or you know, it's been 25 years plus since the original buildings were first done here. So, yes, we anticipated that there would be changes and that there would be a need for continued design oversight on redevelopment of properties.\nSpeaker 1: And yes, there were a number of affordable housing units that were actually created off of Lowry based on the settlement agreement between HUD and numerous parties.\nSpeaker 0: Right. Okay. Those are all the questions I have. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Monte. All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilwoman Sawyer, we've got your back up.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks, Madam President. I think the vast majority of my questions have been answered. Really appreciate. I feel like there's like so many moving parts here. The history of Lowry is very complicated. And there are, for lack of a better term, a lot of hands in the pot when it comes to anything happening in Lowry, a lot of\nSpeaker 3: different oversight and then a lot of different community outreach. So I really appreciate all of those different kind of sectors coming together to explain, you know, what is happening here and some of the complicated challenges that are happening with this rezoning, which is why so many questions have been answered.\nSpeaker 3: I'm wondering, I think sort of final question. If Blair is still in the queue somewhere and Blair, if you don't mind raising your hand, if you are if we could upgrade her. I feel like I just would like some more clarification.\nSpeaker 3: You know, Matt, no offense. You seem like a great guy. United Properties seems great, but I don't trust you. I would like to know a little bit more about an agreement and what that might look like in terms of, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of really good promises being made.\nSpeaker 3: But I would like more certainty the attorney in me needs more certainty than that. So, Blair, if you are back up, would you mind kind of just walking through how that certainty might end up existing? I'd really appreciate it.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks. Sure this is Blair lifting files. Attorney for the.\nSpeaker 0: Applicant.\nSpeaker 3: I missed part of your question while I was being upgraded, so let me know if I don't answer it.\nSpeaker 0: But the applicant and much boss have come to a material term agreement.\nSpeaker 3: It's not signed, but we have agreed on the material terms of what we're calling a community commitment agreement. And this is sort of in lieu of some of the things that.\nSpeaker 1: We have offered to.\nSpeaker 3: Put in writing in favor of one. And they have said that they're unable to sign an agreement at this time. And so we've taken the.\nSpeaker 0: Same community.\nSpeaker 3: Commitments that were intended to go.\nSpeaker 0: Into that agreement with one and put it into an agreement with us. Because as everyone, you're not as much by much, but.\nSpeaker 3: We'll be retaining the property across the street by the high school. And so there are three primary components to the.\nSpeaker 0: Agreement, I would say. The first is obligating us.\nSpeaker 3: As the applicant properties to sign the agreement to build affordable.\nSpeaker 1: Housing.\nSpeaker 3: I think that's in your your pocket and I think you can see that.\nSpeaker 1: Both us and.\nSpeaker 0: The applicant is signed that.\nSpeaker 1: That becomes effective.\nSpeaker 0: Upon the rezoning getting.\nSpeaker 3: Approved. The second piece is.\nSpeaker 0: An acknowledgment by both my.\nSpeaker 3: Staff and the applicant that there are some existing traffic conditions that are.\nSpeaker 0: Causing some consternation among the neighbors and some concerns about safety and whatnot. There's a commitment.\nSpeaker 3: In there for.\nSpeaker 0: The developer.\nSpeaker 3: To work with the residents of the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 0: And members of the community.\nSpeaker 1: The city.\nSpeaker 0: And Dottie to strategize with respect to mitigation.\nSpeaker 3: Measures that are intended to alleviate or remediate those existing traffic conditions.\nSpeaker 0: So we don't know exactly.\nSpeaker 3: What those are. We do know.\nSpeaker 1: What we can.\nSpeaker 3: Do to assist or are committed to helping with that process and continuing to engage with the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 1: As we do.\nSpeaker 3: So. And the third and final piece is an obligation.\nSpeaker 0: To grant an.\nSpeaker 3: Open space easement to the city over the existing Westerly Creek Trail and to improve that trail to provide benches and other amenities. The easement itself will also obligate the property owner to maintain those the trail, the benches, any other amenities in perpetuity.\nSpeaker 3: And then finally, there is an agreement to pursue opportunities for recreational.\nSpeaker 0: Programing on the property.\nSpeaker 3: You guys have heard us talk about a pickleball court. I think that the applicant is excited about a pickleball court.\nSpeaker 1: There's some concerns about.\nSpeaker 0: Noise and.\nSpeaker 3: If that isn't the exact public, the available amenities, and we will come up with something else.\nSpeaker 1: That works for the community to serve.\nSpeaker 3: Those recreational interests. Okay. Great. Thank you. So I have never heard of this before. And do you know, is this the first time that something like this has ever been done? As far as I'm aware. Yes. It really looks like a good neighbor agreement, to be honest with you.\nSpeaker 3: But instead of being with an R.A., it's actually with another property owner and with another entity in in the neighborhood. I think Matt had previously mentioned that we had talked to both the FEMA and the LRA to see if they were interested in being a counterparty.\nSpeaker 3: Right. All agreements need a party and a counterparty. And they had also said that they were unable to sign it for a variety of reasons.\nSpeaker 0: And so because of I don't want to speak for much about.\nSpeaker 3: That, because they will continue to be a neighbor. They do have a vested interest in being as a community member and being.\nSpeaker 1: Supporting.\nSpeaker 3: That. That's a.\nSpeaker 1: Concern of.\nSpeaker 3: Mine and whatnot. And they have the ability to be a counterparty and.\nSpeaker 1: Enter into.\nSpeaker 3: This agreement. So I'm not aware that this has been done before.\nSpeaker 1: But it's still an enforceable agreement between two parties.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Great. Thank you. Really appreciate the clarity on that. Thanks so much. Thanks so much, Madam President. That, I think is the end of my question.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Well, thank you, Blair. And thank you, Councilman Sawyer. The public hearing is now closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 20 1-1371. Council Member Sawyer.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. This is a tough one, I have to say. Again, I want to thank the community for coming out and not just coming out tonight to speak on this, but repeatedly and really engaging with this potential development and and making it, you know, truly better.\nSpeaker 3: I have always said that if something is going to be developed, it has to provide a community benefit and it has to be something that works for the community or it's not worth doing it. So, you know, for example, I'm I am also concerned about the the the traffic circles I drive over in this area all the\nSpeaker 3: time. And it's it's really bad. So I really appreciate Dottie's willingness to engage in this as well and find some solutions during the site process that makes sense for the community and works for the community should this rezoning be approved.\nSpeaker 3: So, you know, I've talked about the traffic circles and the concerns there and how the developer has gone above and beyond to be willing.\nSpeaker 1: To.\nSpeaker 3: Provide some mitigation. I've talked about, you know, the concern of green space, open space and how that kind of doesn't mesh necessarily. Blueprint number doesn't necessarily necessarily mesh. I'm sorry, it's getting late with the with the Lowry reuse plan, but that the Lowry reuse plan is really the thing that the controls here, you know, it's incredibly frustrating\nSpeaker 3: that, you know, nothing has been done yet in terms of the those roundabouts. But I'm really excited to hear that there are improvements coming and appreciate all of the work that the Lowry United Neighborhoods Traffic and Pedestrian Safety Group has done with Dottie and with the community on that.\nSpeaker 3: So, you know, that's really exciting. And I think, you know, this has gone on really long, so I'll keep it short. You know, this property is going to be developed, right? Matchbox has said that they have goals that they want to achieve.\nSpeaker 3: And the way that they as a school can achieve those goals is by selling this property. I looked into it and asked some questions and I know that there were a number of other offers for this property. This was the only one that provided a community benefit at all.\nSpeaker 3: All of the other ones were more multi-family residential properties, like the ones that we just talked about a minute ago where there used to be an assisted living facility that closed and then was raised and then a number of multi-family units were built on that land.\nSpeaker 3: So I don't want the same thing to happen here. If we can ensure that there is a community benefit that does help, you know, not only in terms of affordability, but in terms of aging in place and in terms of more options.\nSpeaker 3: I really am appreciative of that. I also think it's important to note that this developer, not once but twice, was able to say tonight that they are offering something that is doesn't exist in the city and county of Denver right now.\nSpeaker 3: So not only with the agreement to formalize the open space easements and the, you know, traffic mitigation, but and the outreach to the community. But also then that this is the first of its kind in terms of providing affordable units specifically to seniors.\nSpeaker 3: Our community is struggling with that, and that will only continue and get worse over time because of the number of people who are aging in East Denver and because right now we are seeing that those people are getting lost to Arizona and to Littleton.\nSpeaker 3: That's where they go because there's no place for them to age in place in the city and county of Denver that's affordable. And when they're ready to move out of their larger houses for whatever reason, that's the only choice they have.\nSpeaker 3: So it is really exciting, I think, to see that I think it's going to, you know, fill a community benefit. And and so I'm really, you know, I had to work through the consistency with adopted plans piece. But I think that this is extraordinary what we have been able to get from the community in terms of feedback\nSpeaker 3: , what the developer has said that they are willing to do. It's extraordinary. And, you know, given the fact that it's our fourth with waivers right now. So, I mean, tomorrow there could be a four story set of classrooms built on that site.\nSpeaker 3: That is, I think, really important to recognize as well. And so, you know, walking through the specific criteria that we are looking at, I am I am hesitant, but I am supportive of this. So. Thanks, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. And I don't have anybody else in the queue. And so I'll go ahead and round out the comments that I do believe this meets the rezoning criteria. I want to sincerely thank the community members who came and testified tonight and the robust questions and answer session that we had to really dig into this\nSpeaker 0: a bit more. And so I will be supporting this this evening as well. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 21, dash 1371, please. Sawyer, I. Torres. I am black. I see tobacco. I. Clark.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 0: Flinn.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 0: Herndon.\nSpeaker 1: I. Paint. I.\nSpeaker 0: Cashman. I can eat. Ortega. I Sandoval. I. Madam President. I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announced results. 12 Eyes, 12 eyes. Counsel build 20 1-1371 has passed again. Thank you to the community members and city staff who stayed with us for that hearing.\nSpeaker 0: We're going to go ahead and move on to the next one.

        "source": "Speaker 0: Item 14 Communication from Councilman Austin and Councilwoman Mango. Recommendation to include up to eight new storefront retailers licenses in the feasibility analysis that is being prepared for the Long Beach Cannabis Equity Program.\nSpeaker 2: Council member, Austin.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I'm on. Thank you so much. First of all, I want to thank you for the time. It's been a long day. I want to especially thank our council member, Mongo, our DNF chair, for signing on in support of extending this opportunity for.\nSpeaker 6: Economic inclusion that will provide additional cannabis retail licenses for social equity qualified applicants. I have really appreciated the many thought provoking conversations with advocates of the Long Beach Cannabis Commerce Council, the BCA, and with members of the community who reached out to me over the past several months about addressing this perceived equity void.\nSpeaker 6: And for context, back on January 5th, the Council received a report on the current cannabis equity program, which we do. We have one. And the the staff recommendation included preparing a feasibility analysis on licensing and regulating non storefront delivery only shared manufacturing facilities.\nSpeaker 6: However, direction on establishing storefront retail licenses exclusively for social equity applicants was deferred and sent to. The abyss. That direction didn't sit well with me and many others who were paying attention to that item in the community. And so this item that I'm bringing forward this evening is really pretty straightforward.\nSpeaker 6: We're simply asking staff to include up to eight new retail storefront licenses in the Peace and stability analysis currently being prepared for the Lombard's social equity program. These new licenses will be exclusively for social worker to equip applicants who have at least a 51% equity in profits who are interested in the business.\nSpeaker 6: The Why eight Council colleagues. I am open for discussion and open to amend it to up to ten new licenses increases the council. Our city has and should continue to lead with thoughtful and innovative approaches to cannabis policy in the areas of equity especially.\nSpeaker 6: Continuous improvement should be our drive. Today, there are no currently no black owned cannabis retail operations in Long Beach that I'm aware of. And for that fact, I'm not aware of any indigenous or people of color or minority owned storefronts.\nSpeaker 6: Our current equity provisions allow for 40% social equity and employment for retail candidates, but there are no provisions to allow for ownership. And that's a glaring flaw in our equity program. In my opinion, it's a progressive city that is leading on racial equity and inclusion.\nSpeaker 6: We can and should do much better. I also see this work as critically important to restorative justice. Expanding retail cannabis licenses can create wealth and hundreds of new, good paying jobs for communities that have been impacted by the overpolicing and criminalization of cannabis, which is now legal in a very profitable industry.\nSpeaker 6: So tonight I'm asking my colleagues and staff to be thoughtful while moving this item forward. Continue to maintain high standards. Let's be geographically sensitive to approved locations. And I will just let you know I am not interested in over concentrating retail storefront cannabis storefronts in any any area of the city.\nSpeaker 6: And I'm not interested in unfairly scrutinizing new applicants. And so with that said, I would like to move this item and hope for a good discussion this evening and hope I can count on your unanimous support from my colleagues to direct the city manager and staff to expand cannabis retail licenses to social equity qualified applicants.\nSpeaker 6: And my final point is equity delayed is equity denied. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman. I have a second by. Councilman, Mango. Councilman. Councilwoman. Before we have a full speakers list, did you want to go first to the public comment? Which one was it?\nSpeaker 1: Public. I know there's a delay on the screen, sir. Public comment would be great.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so we'll go have a comment and I'll go back to you. So. Madam Clerk, please begin public comment.\nSpeaker 3: Our first speaker is Brandon Bolton.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, mayor, council members and staff, thank you for your time. I am Brant Bolden from the Cannabis Commerce Council of Long Beach. I'm also a member of the National Cannabis Industry Association on the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee.\nSpeaker 4: Lee Triple C We focus on economic empowerment, educational development and career.\nSpeaker 2: Development in the cannabis.\nSpeaker 4: Space. And I also like to give a special thanks to Councilman Austin and his staff.\nSpeaker 2: For bringing this wonderful recommendation forward.\nSpeaker 4: These licenses are a step.\nSpeaker 2: Forward to bring economic prosperity for communities of.\nSpeaker 4: Color's most impacted by the war on drugs in Long Beach. I am in support of the June 14 request to add eight new store to retail licenses in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: There are currently zero black owned retail storefronts, even though that this industry was really built.\nSpeaker 4: On the sacrifices of these.\nSpeaker 2: Black and brown communities in the We Are, that isn't really reflected in the legal cannabis market.\nSpeaker 4: In Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: And it's imperative that the cannabis.\nSpeaker 4: Equity members retain at least 51% of ownership and 51% of profit sharing in these new license types.\nSpeaker 2: So that way we don't.\nSpeaker 4: Undermine the definition of what social equity is in cannabis. And then also, you know, social equity member these retail outlets.\nSpeaker 2: Will allow.\nSpeaker 4: Retail channels and pipelines for social equity members who don't own retail outlets. Right now, a lot of the operators.\nSpeaker 2: Currently are fully vertical.\nSpeaker 3: So I think your next speaker is brave. Freeman.\nSpeaker 2: Hello, my name is Choreographers. I'd like to first start by taking the opportunity to thank the city staff, the council today for allowing me to speak. I am a long time cannabis.\nSpeaker 4: Enthusiast who is passionate about.\nSpeaker 2: Social equity as well as community redevelopment. As Long Beach resident, I have watched a person I call my brother struggle to enter the cannabis industry, even with the verified equity applicant paperwork provided by the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: I want to give credit to LBC, Triple C and other equity groups.\nSpeaker 4: For championing this issue.\nSpeaker 2: Brandon Bolton, who just spoke, and Edgar Cruz as many other diverse recognition for this tireless.\nSpeaker 4: Pursuit of this issue.\nSpeaker 2: I've seen hardworking man take ten steps back.\nSpeaker 4: Just.\nSpeaker 2: To assure that individuals like myself and others can even think of the opportunity of getting into the cannabis industry. As I am guided by the Cannabis Commerce Council of Long Beach. I would also urge the city to approve the recommendations to create more retail license opportunities.\nSpeaker 2: As we have seen, we have more dispensary storefronts being opened across the nation. We also see the legacy markets and communities of colors are being left out, which is unacceptable. Long Beach has the opportunity to show not just the city but the nation how to operate a successful social equity program.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Think your next speaker's brain is.\nSpeaker 2: I'd really be mayor, vice mayor and council members. My name is Brian, and I'm a.\nSpeaker 4: Cannabis entrepreneur here in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm just calling in support of eight new.\nSpeaker 4: Retail licenses.\nSpeaker 2: When the social equity program was created. By the time that happened, there was really the retailers were already at their.\nSpeaker 4: Capacity was.\nSpeaker 2: A lot of buzz out. And get this, you know, not included in this race. So I'm definitely in favor of adding new retail licenses. And I believe it'll enhance our economic inclusion and really give us a fighting chance in and competing with the current operators that seem to be advancing at a faster rate than we could.\nSpeaker 2: So yeah, I'm just trying to be supportive. And so. And so to our solidarity, you know, for our new licenses. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: And your next speaker is Edgar Cruz.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, councilmembers. My name is Cruz and I am the founder of the Cannabis Commerce Council of Long Beach, where we focus on kind of social equity within our jurisdiction. I'd like to start off by thanking Councilwoman Safety, Mongo, countryman Nelson and the staff for championing this agenda.\nSpeaker 2: Also like to thank the City Council, women and men, as well as Vice Mayor Richardson and McCarthy for your time and energy. As the gender 14 is very sacred and historic for some individuals, just like myself, as being an equity applicant.\nSpeaker 2: The first year it started, I was told I was in. I was able to create a cannabis business but unfortunately not create a dispensary just due to the opportunities lacking within our within our community. With the city having a cap of 32 dispensaries within the lottery process, basically created a block of any minorities dreamed of getting any\nSpeaker 2: retail space. While we see multiple private entity obtaining more licensing and opening up more shops, which is basically a big slap in the face to most individuals like myself and the communities of color as I fully support this motion.\nSpeaker 2: I will also say that there are more recommendations that need to be considered as well to assure the success of obtaining by licensing exclusively to social equity recipients as well. Just like my partner said, Brandon. 51% of equity ownership is very exclusive.\nSpeaker 2: And also the opportunity to, you know, give grant or loans when when it comes to real estate, because.\nSpeaker 3: I think your next speaker is James Marks.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. Yes, I'd like to thank.\nSpeaker 4: Councilman.\nSpeaker 6: Alston and Councilwoman Stacey Mongo for bringing.\nSpeaker 2: Forth this bill. What I want to talk about.\nSpeaker 4: Perspective. Imagine opening a lucrative store.\nSpeaker 2: Or brand.\nSpeaker 4: In which you've worked hard to.\nSpeaker 2: Build, and then now you've been targeted.\nSpeaker 6: By mass.\nSpeaker 4: Incarceration and your families destroyed. Beyond reconciling repair and that same product that you used as a survival mechanism.\nSpeaker 6: Is.\nSpeaker 4: Now a legal in enterprise in your community. And that has somewhat formed a monopoly and excluded you and others like you from your.\nSpeaker 2: Community, from participating in the growth and.\nSpeaker 4: Development of that in your own respective communities economy. So for over ten years, we have to deny not only ownership but also our opportunity of ownership. This is a ten year journey vision fight that many may not know about.\nSpeaker 6: But it has had weekly.\nSpeaker 4: Meetings, whether.\nSpeaker 2: Via Zoom, many.\nSpeaker 4: Airlines flight across the country in all 12 Los Angeles County. And we're still a block out of that market today. We're still being denied a basic human right. And that is the opportunity to become.\nSpeaker 2: Business owners.\nSpeaker 4: In our own community. Thank you, Councilwoman Sorrell. And my heart goes out to you and your community. I really not only understand.\nSpeaker 2: But I don't really understand.\nSpeaker 4: What's going to win. The face of racism rears its ugly head. It is something that.\nSpeaker 3: Think your next speaker is Julian Xavier.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. To the mayor and to the city council. My name is Julian Xavier, representing me and my son who was an angel, Andre, as a verified social equity applicant. I'm here to discuss the city opening eight retail locations with social equity verified applicants.\nSpeaker 4: This is a great way for us to get into the industry with so many real estate hurdles along side with owners are still showing locations that are. Applicants have submitted initial applications and have not withdrawn. We are just like in a limbo and it's hard for us and we really need this to catapult us in to the\nSpeaker 4: next era of. Creating generational wealth, you know, is really hard for us. There's so much stacked against us. You know, we need this to just get in and help us help you get tax money to really take us to the next level in this community.\nSpeaker 4: As a Long Beach applicant, I'm telling you, it's a really hard fight and we really need. The city to look at applicants and applications who have been sitting there dormant, holding up locations. Right. And not moving forward. There's so much that's going on that we really need your help and we're here for the long haul.\nSpeaker 4: Some people are just here for a just a lunch meal, but we're here for the long haul to just. Create this generational wealth that we.\nSpeaker 3: Think your next speakers memorial burial.\nSpeaker 4: Great evening for giving glory and honor to God. Second, thank you, Mayor and Council, for opening the Florida comments. My name is Muriel Barrow, also known as Mae Barrow, and I'm a verified social equity applicant, a mother of four and a cannabis company CEO.\nSpeaker 4: I was born and raised in Long Beach, where my immigrant, Filipino mother and my black father growing up in the projects, graduating from poly, then later on purchasing a home within the city. Needless to say, Long Beach is home.\nSpeaker 4: Currently I have a cannabis events license and have been in talks with the City of Long Beach regarding being allowed to host its first ever legal cannabis education fair where consumption is allowed, as well as seeking your approval to open a retail locations.\nSpeaker 4: After our conversations, I found out that over 30 dispensaries are allowed in Long Beach, yet none were social equity. This is very disheartening as there is nothing equal about this scenario. Today we have the opportunity to change that.\nSpeaker 4: Allowing these social equity retail licenses is a small step toward righting the decades worth of wrongs that the city and this war on drugs, a.k.a. the war on people, has done. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Our next speaker is Nasreen Elahi.\nSpeaker 4: Hello, City Council. My name is a strange story and I'm a cannabis equity applicant. In 2018, the Cannabis Equity Program was designed to bolster opportunities for minority community members that were directly impacted by the war on drugs. Currently, equity applicants have no access to retail licenses.\nSpeaker 4: Applicants are still being shut out of the most significant revenue source of the cannabis economy. How does the cannabis equity program expect to give equal opportunities if equity applicants are missing from the most important and most financially accessible part of the cannabis industry?\nSpeaker 4: Opening eight new storefront licenses for equity applicants will help close the divide on economic exclusion. It will allow us to be a part of the new industry that is expected to grow to 35 billion by 2025, according to North Bay Business Journal.\nSpeaker 4: Giving equity applicants for these storefronts will allow us to boost our local economy and help close the economic divide that we are currently facing. As an equity applicant, I've experienced the frustration of red tape firsthand, knowing that I currently do not have the same opportunities in the new and complex industry of cannabis.\nSpeaker 4: As frustrating. My parents were immigrants who started a small business in Long Beach. I grew up watching my parents struggle, trying to make it out of economic oppression while cultivating community. The community is what kept us going. It gives us a space not just for retail, but a place where we create a family.\nSpeaker 4: While funding is a huge improvement for this program, inclusion in retail is the next step we need to make together. Allow us to be part of the industry that had originally targeted us. Help us to heal and bring us closer.\nSpeaker 4: Closer to closing the economic oppression and bondage allowed ink.\nSpeaker 3: Your next speaker is Miko Macias. Michael Macias. Our next speaker is Sherry Franklin.\nSpeaker 4: Hello. This is Sherry Franklin. Thank you, mayor and council members. And thank you, council member Austin for your leadership. I represent Calvary Incubator with the largest cannabis incubator in the country, proving that social equity applicants can thrive. Hi.\nSpeaker 4: How's it going? My name is Mike. And give back to their community. We are also we have thinking Gro Lab, which provides technical assistance to organizations such as the Cannabis Coalition of Long Beach. And I so support the leadership of Edgar Cruz and Brandon Bolden.\nSpeaker 4: We should lift them up in their drive to make sure their social equity is available. When we do that, we improve our community, communities, economic empowerment. We help the small businesses, people buy homes when the licenses are not up and from our community they do not help recycle dollars, only provide the taxes.\nSpeaker 4: And that isn't a way to to improve a community. And also the pride of a community we found where social equity thrives, so does the community. And we urge you to support the eight additional licenses or more. And we applaud you for your leadership.\nSpeaker 4: Everyone is watching and we want to share how wonderful your leadership has helped move social equity forward. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Our next speaker is Michael Macias.\nSpeaker 4: Hi.\nSpeaker 2: How's it going? My name is Michael Macias. I was born and raised in Long.\nSpeaker 4: Beach, California. I now live in Sacramento, California.\nSpeaker 2: I'm actually.\nSpeaker 4: In huge support of this.\nSpeaker 2: Coming through.\nSpeaker 4: With our city.\nSpeaker 2: I have now seen many other cities that are starting to do the right thing and.\nSpeaker 4: Really have a stance and support system for the social equity programs coming out. Sacramento specifically has already.\nSpeaker 2: Moved.\nSpeaker 4: Towards a positive direction.\nSpeaker 2: As well. You know, they are giving.\nSpeaker 4: Social equity applicants ten dispensaries. So there's many other cities as well as the state.\nSpeaker 2: That's now moving, you know, has now opened up their own social equity.\nSpeaker 4: Section and everyone is just moving towards the support.\nSpeaker 2: I feel like Long Beach should.\nSpeaker 4: Also stand behind all of us and they should also show their support by opening the storefront section, which.\nSpeaker 2: We all know is a.\nSpeaker 4: Huge role in the cannabis industry. So my comment is just to support and say thank you to everyone that's working really hard on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Edgar. Thank you, councilman and councilwoman, for for doing this. And I really appreciate everyone and I hope you guys are.\nSpeaker 4: Able to make the right call and the right decision on this and show your support. I think that this city is a great city and I really love this city. I would love to see all these positive impacts happen.\nSpeaker 4: So if we can be in a.\nSpeaker 3: I think your next speaker, Stefan. With a rescue. Stefan Blatter rescue.\nSpeaker 2: Hi there.\nSpeaker 4: First, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank.\nSpeaker 2: City council today for allowing me to speak. My name is Justin Steel, and I have been a Long Beach resident all my life. I'm on the board of the.\nSpeaker 4: Cannabis Commerce Council of Long Beach, and as I see the city of Long Beach in the process of discussing more opportunities social equity, storefront retail, licensing.\nSpeaker 2: I completely fully support this.\nSpeaker 4: Motion to approve and also go to take extra steps to ensure they can sustain.\nSpeaker 2: A successful cannabis business to begin with. There are many pathways the city can create to achieve these goals, and I urge that you make sure when having these.\nSpeaker 4: Discussions in regards to social equity, it's imperative that social equity recipients.\nSpeaker 2: Are at the table.\nSpeaker 4: In the state and nation needs to see a thriving, successful social equity program. And I truly.\nSpeaker 2: Believe, along with many others, that Long Beach is the perfect.\nSpeaker 4: Place. Providing retail store opportunity exclusively to social.\nSpeaker 2: Equity would be a vital asset for equity applicants.\nSpeaker 4: To continue becoming more part of an industry.\nSpeaker 2: The revolt revolves.\nSpeaker 4: Its marketing structure.\nSpeaker 2: And regular and regular regularities around minorities being in the cannabis.\nSpeaker 4: Industry. I really appreciate you.\nSpeaker 2: Guys only speak today and I truly want to thank everybody.\nSpeaker 4: Pushing this forward.\nSpeaker 2: All of the Long Beach community.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Let me go ahead and go back. So I'm going to go back to Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I really appreciate the community and all their comments. Many of you know that this item was heard before a committee that I have served on since 2014, in December, at which time the item I didn't get a lot of advance notice except for the general posting of the agenda, and I brought up some\nSpeaker 1: concerns at the time related to equity and some of the other opportunities that are available for community members to actually really build wealth. And what does that look like? And some of the conversations I had with cannabis. Dispensary owners in my district and in other cities and their experiences in how to learn and build wealth.\nSpeaker 1: And that was on a really sharp turn turnaround with a 72 hour posting. So when Councilmember Austin reached out to me, I thought, you know, this could go back to my committee now that I am chairwoman of economic development and finance.\nSpeaker 1: But I felt like it was really worthy of a city wide discussion. And I really appreciate Councilmember Austin for having the courage to stand up and bring it forward. There are other cities like ours. Sacramento was mentioned by one of the participants there of similar size 500,000 people.\nSpeaker 1: They have similar number of dispensaries. They currently have 30. And they are to considering an additional ten potential licenses because of the opportunity to really be serious about equity and put the communities that were most impacted first. And while we while it's easiest to move forward with delivery opportunities and the such, the wealth building opportunities are just\nSpeaker 1: not the thing. I really appreciate the plan put forward by the Long Beach Collective Association. While I connected with many of the members on their social equity committee, I was not able to fit in another agenda at a meeting with them yet, but I hope to meet with them later this week.\nSpeaker 1: I really appreciated a lot of the things that they drew attention to. They talk about the business education and the revision of the point system. They talk about getting the Human Relations Commission involved in the revision. I think that all of these are really important because when we hear from our city staff and I know that the\nSpeaker 1: timing on the agenda item in December was also unfortunate. It was important, and I really appreciate the former chair bringing it forward because I was not aware that we were going to lose our our cannabis czar. AJ was a champion for the industry in the city and really knew and understood the details.\nSpeaker 1: And I felt in hindsight it was important to move forward on something related to equity before he exited the city and moved on to other opportunities. But that doesn't mean that we can leave well enough alone. We really need to address the opportunities.\nSpeaker 1: And like Councilmember Austin said, it's not I'm not sure where we go with how many, if it's one, if it's five, if it's eight. But I do know that one of the main things that we talked about when we talked about creating a cannabis ordinance way back when, before it went to the voters, was the concern that\nSpeaker 1: we had related to the number of dispensaries. And when that concern was brought forward by certain members of the Council, the response by many of the members of the council who sit here with us today was that if we have too few dispensaries, we're going to be looking at a a.\nSpeaker 1: More impact to the communities that have those dispensaries. And I am one of those districts. So we have several dispensaries in the district. And at some of those dispensaries it looks like it's Black Friday. Every single day the lines are around the building.\nSpeaker 1: There is not enough parking because even though the parking meets the city requirements, the volume and demand for cannabis is so high that when we add an extra hour, you directly see the revenue increase of those dispensaries. I've talked to some of those dispensary owners and of course, when we had an honest conversation, they're like, you know\nSpeaker 1: , giving up eight additional licenses or four additional licenses or who knows, 12 additional licenses means cutting into my profit share and my market. And, you know, I really talk a lot about the fear that the community had when we were adding a Starbucks and how that could disproportionately impact the grounds coffee shop and the coffee bean.\nSpeaker 1: But what we found was that both of those other coffee shops thrived more when another was introduced to the market because the real commitment to growing the customer base was there. And different customers have different needs and different stores function differently to reach out to and gain those customers.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that ownership that comes with equity is going to have a different perspective. And I think it's I said this in December, I can't remember it wasn't a meeting at the dais, but the fact that we had 200 applicants and only one made it to the finish line or the final stages means there's something wrong\nSpeaker 1: with the process. And I know I heard some individuals talk about the 51% ownership and 50% profitability. And when talking to some of the highest grossing cannabis dispensary owners, it's a really scary thought for them to. Invest a lot of their personal capital in an industry or a a not an industry, an additional store that they would\nSpeaker 1: be a minority shareholder in. And so if you watch Shark Tank, you learn a lot about investment strategy and you often see that you can choose to be upfront 1% owner. Thank you. I'll finish the sentence and I'll be glad to pass it on.\nSpeaker 1: There are lots of businesses that say I want to own 51% of my company and that's the most important thing. But as Mark Cuban says, you can own 51% of a grape or you can partner with me and you can own 10% of the ocean because the amount of money you can make, if properly partnered with a\nSpeaker 1: a person who really knows the industry, the possibilities are endless. So while I would like 51% to stay with equity, I don't necessarily. Feel like we know that the best route is that all 51% needs to be owned by one person.\nSpeaker 1: There might be strategies that we could implore to make five or six millionaires out of a partner. So I really appreciate and want to hear from my colleagues and I want to continue to hear from the industry and what they've learned.\nSpeaker 1: And I want to continue to hear from the communities that are near these cannabis dispensaries, because they're the ones that feel very strongly that more are needed so that their communities could get a break from the parking challenges that come with the number of customers that some of these very successful cannabis operators, despite their amazing community resilience\nSpeaker 1: and their partnership with the communities, but what they could look at, they could do together. So thank you so much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I don't have any other councilmembers cued up right now. We went through public comment, so I'm going to go ahead and call for a roll call vote. Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I'll queue up a few times because I think there I have a lot of questions about people.\nSpeaker 2: So I've been an advocate for this for a long time. I know the timeline was presented today. It started in January. This goes actually this goes back pretty far. And so I want to start and ask some questions.\nSpeaker 2: I'll just clarify the record here. So, Tom or Kevin, can you walk us through the timeline of cannabis equity since this issue was brought up last summer during the reconciliation process? Walk us through what took place.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, Vice Mayor, I'll start and Kevin can jump in. This started back in July, I believe, of 2020, where there was a request to really look at what are some of the options for cannabis equity. We came back with a memo outlining some of those options in August, and that kind of started the ball rolling.\nSpeaker 5: We looked at shared use manufacturing, we looked at equity ownership. We also looked at delivery only. This then had some further discussion at Economic and Development and Finance Committee, and then that is the motion that was forwarded to the Council in January 5th, I believe, where we kind of outlined a number of the pros and cons to\nSpeaker 5: each of those strategies, talked a little bit about some of the staff time it takes to do those types of work. And then the council ultimately approved the two items that was part of our current work plan. And then, of course, if we're looking to add anything else, we'd have to figure out how that fits into our\nSpeaker 5: work plan just with the amount of staff that.\nSpeaker 2: We do have. All right. So the motion in July was that a staff recommendation was a council recommendation. And do you know do you know that you have.\nSpeaker 5: In July was account's recommendation?\nSpeaker 2: Right. So that was a council recommendation that I made with Councilman Austin, Councilman Andrews as cosigners on that item with Councilmember Pierce. And what it expressed, what it requested was it said the cannabis equity program is not doing the right things, it's not delivering.\nSpeaker 2: Began the process of starting and evaluating the program. Now find out if there needs to be a ballot measure because there was a question on whether or not because it was originally established by a ballot measure, where do we need it to go to the ballot?\nSpeaker 2: That's what initiated this conversation. The report came back and said, You do not need to go to the ballot on recreational, not medicinal, and came back with a recommendation to start with shared use and delivery and do more research on brick and mortar because of a number of factors.\nSpeaker 2: Now, city manager staff recommended to go with brick and mortar. I mean, to go with delivery and shared use first. What was that based on? Why did staff recommend that?\nSpeaker 5: Yeah, I'll have Kevin Jackson answer that, please.\nSpeaker 6: Sure. Yeah. Thank you, Vice Mayor. So the recommendation. So, again, just to paraphrase, we. All three options were under consideration. The recommendation to move forward with shared use, development of a shared use manufacturing manufacturing ordinance and the feasibility study on the delivery only license type was to to try to provide an immediate opportunity to to facilitate access\nSpeaker 6: to equity ownership, because these two license types actually require less capital and they're less complex to develop while all of them are complex to to develop in terms of regulations and programing, these were the least complex and require the least capital and provided a lower barrier to entry for equity owners than the dispensary retail option.\nSpeaker 6: So the dispensary retail option was was among the three. But we prioritize the other two because we felt like they gave us an immediate opportunity to provide some opportunities for equity ownership while still pursuing the the third option with retail dispensaries in the future.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. So you brought up there was a 15 minute presentation about the barriers to brick and mortar. And we acknowledge I remember push you in saying, well, you know, we need to make some time for this now.\nSpeaker 2: I'll get to that. We need to make sure we we sort of get there and address this. So the idea was staff recommend it be that these we can do today we can do this today, but we need a little bit more time on the others.\nSpeaker 2: So we recommended to move forward with those. So I want to know so I want to know about some of those barriers. Some of the things that were raised were concerns about the prices to get in the market of a lack of examples of cities who got it right, a lot of predatory practices, a lot of, you\nSpeaker 2: know, things that that you really don't want in the neighborhood. Right. So there were a lot of barriers. Can you walk us through a few of those barriers that staff stood tall and said, these are the issues that we really need to make sure we get right.\nSpeaker 2: What are some of those barriers?\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. So what, what we what we found in just monitoring what's happened in some of the other jurisdictions throughout California where they've applied a cap and reserved an absolute number of licenses for four equity applicants, is that there has there has not been a lot of success in maintaining those equity applicants once they once they actually get\nSpeaker 6: a license. And so the what we found is that there are partnerships that have been formed with investors that begin with the equity applicant having a majority ownership, 51% or more ownership. But then shortly thereafter, these equity applicants are are not either in the majority ownership or they're no longer in the ownership structure at all.\nSpeaker 6: And and so what it amounts what it has amounted to is there are multiple instances in multiple cities where there just investors have employed predatory practices and taken advantages, taking advantage of equity applicants. And so while we've been keeping an eye on this and looking at this option, because we do believe it's a viable option for us\nSpeaker 6: to look at, we just recognize that it's very complex and will require some feasibility analysis and analysis for us to understand how to address that issue so that equity applicants are not taken advantage of when we do put a process in place.\nSpeaker 2: Right, it's been 5 minutes great that great are cued up again and my next in line where. Actually have another person, and then you're up after that. Okay, great. I'll come back. Got a lot of questions. A lot of good facts need to come out in this discussion, so I'm just gonna keep doing this.\nSpeaker 2: Keep it going. Thanks, councilman. Councilman. Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I'm glad this is a good break so we can have a good dialog here. Mr. Richardson So we did talk about less complex and how delivery is less complex. At that point. I kind of brought up that there are also other delivery models that really support franchising so much better.\nSpeaker 1: We have not yet tackled the same thing that we did for like the Yelp and the delivery models for our restaurants, for the big owner in the market. Right. The the the \u00a35,000 gorilla is really weakness and their barrier to entry and ownership of that market.\nSpeaker 1: One of the things I think is really amazing about the language cannabis growth is that a majority of the owners, at least in my district, they're all Long Beach residents. Right. So when you want someone to really invest in equity, their likelihood of picking up another Long Beach person.\nSpeaker 1: It's a market they know well. Some of our Long Beach cannabis owners also are breaking into other cities. And so that really allows them to grow their market. But they also feel that there's opportunity still in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: So some of those owners I've encouraged to join, I'll be seeing not all of them have. Some have been before and then they aren't. And there's all sorts of dynamics of that. But I know that it's really important to listen to stuff recommendations.\nSpeaker 1: And Kevin and I have talked about it many, many times and sometimes very excitedly. But you, Mr. Richardson, led last week on an item where we rejected the staff's recommendation. And I think that it's important that when an item such as equity is so important, that it be able to come back.\nSpeaker 1: Even when the staff are leveraged. I know that you and I agree on this, and we brought many items to the city manager and there was just not enough time and not enough resources. And then many of those things, especially with the digital divide and now Senator Gonzalez was on a lot of those items with us.\nSpeaker 1: They became a top priority once Coburn was here, but there was never enough resources to make those shifts. And how do we done those things and how do we push staff when we knew we were in a position to do that and we were excited about those items, we would have been so much farther along in the\nSpeaker 1: digital divide by the time Cogan got here. And so as I see these other cities moving forward on equity, I just want to make sure that we're still at the table. So that wasn't what I had originally planned to say, but you had such great comments.\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to kind of add on to that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I think it comes from Mango. I have basically Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just be clear. I have a number of questions for staff. I'll get my opinions. I'll get my opinions later. I want to see this happen.\nSpeaker 2: I just don't want to mislead the community as if this thing started in January. I don't want to raise until the expectations about if you get it. All we have to do is pick a number. We would have picked the number.\nSpeaker 2: This was about going through the process of doing the right place. We have some integrity about the process. A couple of questions. So. So, Kevin. Kevin, you mentioned those barriers. Now, has the landscape changed at all from January when this council voted unanimously, including Councilman Austin Mango voted unanimously on the recommendation?\nSpeaker 2: Has the landscape changed from January to today? Around some of those concerns, other concerns going away.\nSpeaker 6: No. Those are still very real concerns that we'll have to grapple with in the feasibility analysis whenever we get to it. The only thing that's that's changed a little bit is, you know, we're just we're further along on the initiatives that council gave us direction to work on.\nSpeaker 6: And so those initiatives are currently underway, which is the development of the shared use manufacturing ordinance and the feasibility analysis on the delivery only license type.\nSpeaker 2: Right. So. So what we set out and said was we're going to phase. Just want to start with the easier things. We started in January. Where are you with those two easier things? The particularly shared use and delivery.\nSpeaker 2: Are we close to delivering those?\nSpeaker 6: So we do have a workplan for those two items. And in those work, plans are underway. I'm going to ask Emily Armstrong, our new cannabis program manager, to to to share information on kind of where we are with the current status of those initiatives.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Before we do that report, I kind of manage this five minute clock a little bit. There was a statement that what the council did was send the brick and mortar to the abyss. That was the language that was, you guessed it.\nSpeaker 2: OC Was was there a reference to six months and six coming back within six months in the Economic Development Committee recommendation was that reference that city council.\nSpeaker 6: The reference to six months was was actually a part of the motion. The Ely and F Economic Development Finance Committee motion. The the recommendation at council. The motion that was approved only included the the the direction to move forward with the preparation of the shared use manufacturing ordinance and to conduct the delivery only feasibility analysis.\nSpeaker 6: There was some discussion at the meeting that indicated that that described the conversations in the motion that happened at EDI and F, but the six month reference was not in the council motion. It was in the EDI and F motion.\nSpeaker 6: Right. Right.\nSpeaker 2: So that's not the abyss. Staff said, Hey, we got to do this 1/1. We need more direction on some very key deliverables. Like how many dispensaries? How are you going to protect it from, you know, some of these predatory practices and starting the work plan?\nSpeaker 2: So we said, okay, do the easy stuff now and come back now. I have to say, if there were concerns about the six month, they're not coming back within six months. I would have accepted a motion to make it three or whatever it was.\nSpeaker 2: But the only friendly amendment that was offered was not from Councilman Austin, was not from Councilmember Mongo. It was from Councilmember Sara. She talked about the loophole, the gaping loophole in our program that needed to be corrected and that anybody who's unemployed in our city, no matter what district you're from, from any district in the city, any\nSpeaker 2: community, if you're unemployed, you are considered an equity applicant. Now, that loophole was inserted into this process by Councilmember Mongo. I vocally opposed it. I voted against it. And what ultimately happened was I had a meeting where there wasn't a full city council.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember Mongo, supported by Councilman Alston, inserted that loophole that effectively gutted our cannabis equity ordinance. Councilmember Sorrow. Fix that in January. If there were a friendly amendment to say, I'm uncomfortable with six months, how about we phase it in three months?\nSpeaker 2: How about we do do explore these factors now? We would have expected, except that I think it's just important that people understand that there were concerns, there was a whole discussion and this was not some big industry thing about we want to do this, we want to do that.\nSpeaker 2: I thought it was a healthy discussion of council, so I'm probably at my 5 minutes, but I actually have I have some recommendations that will make it better. And I have just a few more kind of questions that I want to I want to get to.\nSpeaker 2: So I just cued up again about my 5 minutes. I just had a timer. I want to do this, Mr. Mayor. Okay. I have two other folks queued up right now. Johnson, Austin.\nSpeaker 6: Thanks. So cannabis has been a long policy and complicated policy for many years. Been on the council since 2012. And when I first got on this council, there was a ban in place. The ban actually went in place a week before I joined the council and we went through those machinations.\nSpeaker 6: We are now at a place where cannabis is a legal commodity. We have storefronts opening it and the fact is that people are still excluded from owning retail storefronts. My item actually addresses that and gives clear direction and shows that this council is is is committed truly committed to two to equity.\nSpeaker 6: We can filibuster this all night long and go through the revisionist history of cannabis policy in Long Beach. I don't think that's necessary, Mr. Richardson. I think with any policy on any given Tuesday, we can come back and clean up correct and give clear direction for staff, and that is the intent.\nSpeaker 6: This evening, again, I spoke when this item came in January, on January 5th. I spoke and I have my concerns. And and I did ask that regarding the items that we were looking at in terms of delivery services and shared manufacturing.\nSpeaker 6: I asked if this was excluded exclusively for social equity qualified candidates in the response was no. So anybody would be qualified for to use those. And so so the difference in what we're trying to do this evening is clear for exclusively.\nSpeaker 6: It's an exclusive policy exclusively for social equity qualified candidates. Stop mention that we decided to move with the less complex, the less in the in the direction that will require less capital, which assumes a lot about the applicants.\nSpeaker 6: But it also says that that we are we're saying that if you're socially if you're a social equity candidate, that you're going to make less profits and you're going to be in the less profitable areas of the cannabis industry.\nSpeaker 6: And I think that's the wrong message to send tonight. And then another question is regarding the investors. One thing that we did not do and we still don't do, it doesn't matter if it's a cannabis business or if it's a pizza place.\nSpeaker 6: The city council does not get involved in who's investing, right? Where's your money coming from? Right. I mean, we have done that for every every every every applicant. You know, I think we were probably been it would have been very alarming.\nSpeaker 6: Investors come in and people can invest in businesses. And we should we should encourage that. But we should encourage minorities. We should encourage young black entrepreneurs, young Latino entrepreneurs, young young people of color to get involved, particularly in this industry.\nSpeaker 6: And so I understand, you know, you may have some recommendations. I like to help the conversation, but I mean, at the end of the day. And I know you were a champion for equity. This is about ownership equity in the cannabis retail space.\nSpeaker 6: I hope you can support this. Thanks.\nSpeaker 2: I think it. Councilmember Vice Mayor Richardson. All right? Yeah, I'm just trying to land this plane the right way. So the issue here is that it's been the framing. Number one, the frame is off. You're right. Ask for equity, and I want to get there as soon as possible.\nSpeaker 2: I also want to make sure we consider we you know, we go through the process that and consider some of those risks we talked about. And staff should be studying that and evaluating that. So my question for staff is based on based on what it requires to get to cannabis ownership for brick and mortar, what are the\nSpeaker 2: next steps required? What would you recommend? Are the next steps required? That's where. That's where Mr. Mulder go.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I'll take it. Okay. Smart. So, you know, we need it. We need it. We need a licensing process in order to to facilitate access to equity ownership, access to brick and mortar dispensary facilities. And so we need an opportunity to study that and and develop the appropriate regulations and programs and programing to to facilitate that.\nSpeaker 6: The but I will say that capital is, you know, having enough capital to actually invest in an equity business or start up an equity business or start up a cannabis business, I should say I'm sorry, is, is, is the number one issue.\nSpeaker 6: And so if you want to start up a brick and mortar dispensary business, you know, from what we've what we've learned, it's at least $1,000,000 to do that. Some of these the level of investment to start up, some of these smaller scale businesses like that are related to shared use and delivery.\nSpeaker 6: Only the capital requirements are less. And so it just provides more of an opportunity, an immediate opportunity.\nSpeaker 2: Right. Right. I get that. And we did that. Are very devoted on that. I'm talking about with House of Mouse milestones. Really try and get to here. I think, you know, there was a floor in the motion in January.\nSpeaker 2: I wish you would have brought it up in January, but it didn't in any given Tuesday. These things can come up absolutely right. My concern is that we're not overcommitting or promising things or making promises not rooted on data or science or any kind of best practice.\nSpeaker 2: So I want to just get to what steps needs to start from now.\nSpeaker 6: So sort of so what would be involved in this in this effort? And this is similar to the other efforts. So we're going to have to do a regulatory analysis. And in this particular instance, the in order to create additional dispensary licenses, they're more likely going to have to be adult use only licenses and not dual license\nSpeaker 6: like the other 32. Because in order to create additional licenses for medical dual lights were meant for for medical the it would right the the voter approved initiative it would have to go to the voters to do that.\nSpeaker 6: So. So that's that's one issue. We have to develop the application and licensing process, which will be very involved is, you know, if you can recall, we just got to the point where we're nearly done issuing all of the 32 licenses from the from the initial dispensary process.\nSpeaker 6: And so that process was very involved in this. One will be two, particularly if there's going to be a cap and a resident reservation for equity. So we'll have to develop the appropriate application and licensing process for that.\nSpeaker 6: We were we would also be benchmarking the other cities. We've done some analysis of some of the other cities and the lack of success and relative success they've had in this area. We understand that there are some issues with with predatory practices.\nSpeaker 6: So we would want to to make sure whatever we create here, that we create something that works and that we resolve that issue and that we don't experience the issues that are happening in some of the other cities.\nSpeaker 6: So as part of the benchmarking study and looking at the other cities more closely, we would get a better understanding of what we need to do to address that issue. We also, because we're talking about equity is critically important and we're already doing this with the other initiatives, and we would do that with this one as well\nSpeaker 6: , is making sure that we are reaching out to the the community, those who are concerned about equity and making sure that we're taking and collecting that input so that it informs the development of the regulations in the program and also reaching out to the industry as well.\nSpeaker 6: We'd also do an examination of all the resources that would be required to implement the the the new licensing program.\nSpeaker 2: So in general of that takes about how much time, I would say. So figure that out.\nSpeaker 6: So if we were doing this.\nSpeaker 2: Six months at the committee, does it really take six months? And six months have already gone in January? At least for how long does it take you to get it done?\nSpeaker 6: If if if we and I want to mention that we're going to be doing this with with nine departments. So this is not just the city management practice. This this this work impacts the nine other departments. And so, you know, we have to evaluate the the workload of all the other departments in the context of everything that's\nSpeaker 6: going on in the city. So so that's an element of it as well. But I would say that if we were if we were doing this work in isolation of anything else, it like, say, if we put the other initiatives on hold and we did this in isolation of everything else, we could probably get this work done\nSpeaker 6: in 90 days.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All right. Now we got a number, and I wouldn't want you to stop what you're currently doing. I think. I think the goal here is that was left out. We got to include that. It realistically takes 90 days to do it.\nSpeaker 2: So this is. Okay. That's good to know. And so 5 minutes I cued up again. Okay. Okay. I'll be in my next mayor. No, we have accounts. I'll come back.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. Well, I'm still trying to wait for this plane to land. And, you know, it's been a long night.\nSpeaker 2: You want to. I just want to finish.\nSpeaker 6: With a good discussion. Good discussion. And I think one of the questions that that was also asked is how has the landscape changed between January and today? And we just had a report earlier, about $235 million of economic relief coming to the city.\nSpeaker 6: And part of that is cannabis start startup could go toward economic development for cannabis startups. And so I think the landscape has significantly changed since January, number one, and we need to keep that in mind. And that should be part of a driver here to move forward on equity ownership in in cannabis retail space.\nSpeaker 6: And so I wanted to make sure I got that point in our. Mr. RICHARDSON Vice Mayor, because you again, have been involved with our Edendale economic development base. To me, I'm kind of befuddled as to why we this is this is even more of an exercise right now.\nSpeaker 6: This should be something that this council should be jumping at doing, considering all that we have been through, considering the goals of our racial equity and reconciliation process, understanding that we have a mission and a in any charge to deliver equity for all our constituents.\nSpeaker 6: And so that I would I would ask that, you know, again, I'm glad we're doing kind of. I was going to ask the city manager and to put a timeline on this to me 90 days. And if I can amend my initial motion to include that this return to the council in 90 days.\nSpeaker 6: And just for clarification, I'll read with the motion this request that the city manager include up to eight new storefront retail licenses in the feasibility analysis that is being prepared for the Long Beach Cannabis Equity Program right in there.\nSpeaker 6: And secondly, we define that, that it should be exclusively for socially social equity qualified candidates, and they should have at least 51% interest in the business. I think that's pretty clear. You know, what we're talking about is an analysis and including this in the study that's concurrently underway, currently underway to to allow social equity for delivery services\nSpeaker 6: as well as shared use manufacturing that's able.\nSpeaker 2: Vice Mayor Richards didn't. Thank you. Is the five minute process. When when this discussion started, we didn't have these rules. You can get all your questions answered at once and then land the plane. But this is the rules from us.\nSpeaker 2: So. All right. So, you know, I don't want to filibuster, but when we put the.\nSpeaker 6: Rules in place because of one.\nSpeaker 2: Long council meeting. Right. Some things require conversation. If there was more conversation, we wouldn't have a lot of dispensaries concentrated in my neighborhood and certain areas of town. We should have put more consideration. You know, there was a vote when we talked about one four district years ago.\nSpeaker 2: You voted against that motion, one per district. That's what triggered this to go to the ballot. And we lost all the control here. But I just want to I just want to finish. So I agree that things have changed when we made this decision on the fifth of a six month phase, it may not make sense.\nSpeaker 2: When we made this decision back on January 5th, we were at the height of a pandemic. We couldn't think about opening stores or restaurants, and everybody was literally potete protest. And at the time there was a lot of drama going on.\nSpeaker 2: Couldn't think about that. Also, a number of cities attempted this across California. It failed. So I want to make sure we get the program right. I've said that from beginning this motion today. I get it. It's political theater.\nSpeaker 2: But that doesn't change my position that these things need to be done the right way. I don't want to see you know, I don't want to make ourselves risk, you know, increase the risk of exploitation. Somebody in my community get a license.\nSpeaker 2: They're moved out six months from them. I want to make sure that it's tight if the goal is to explore and to provide cannabis entrepreneurs opportunities. But I open up brick and mortar I support that is built on a solid foundation.\nSpeaker 2: That's that's what needs to happen. So there are a number of points that we need to decide on as a council. So, one, how do we make sure the system is fair and balanced for local people? I got letters from Sacramento, Oakland, all these people.\nSpeaker 2: Why are they so interested in Long Beach opening up their dispensary business? No. You know, I'm not getting a lot of like residents reaching out to me, saying, you know, hey, this is this is what I'm not getting that I'm not really here.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to make sure the local residents who want to do it get a fair shot of doing it. So the motion in January wanted a more full evaluation. It was clear that we need three months to make that happen.\nSpeaker 2: Sounds like you're amenable to keeping that in. You're making that a part of your your motion sounded like it sounded like that, so I'm good with that. So what's the timetable of six months? So I'm going to offer to friendly members here.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Austin one of them is in addition to the 30, the 90 days. So one, I want to make sure that we're setting aside the funds. We made a motion at the recovery during the recovery discussion to identify economic empowerment zones.\nSpeaker 2: A strategy within that that's called out is to build a local pipeline, an actual local pipeline, so local people can get in Q and go through the process and get a preference for local people to actually land these licenses.\nSpeaker 2: And so I'm offering a friendly amendment that or I can just substitute it, but I can offer a friendly amendment that we begin this pipeline and make that a part of this process, a local ground up pipeline. So local people have an opportunity to get into this.\nSpeaker 6: I'm I'm okay with that.\nSpeaker 2: Right. All right. I would make sure that pipeline is connected to this economic empowerment zones. People north central west Long Beach. So need those opportunities. So absolutely sure that will work. All right. And you know, and just to be clear, I'm asking these questions I need to ask.\nSpeaker 2: You know, I don't have to control everything related to equity. The hope was at some point the political support would change. So if this is an issue you want to take on and lead on support, you can take this run with not a big deal, but we're going to have to make sure it's real.\nSpeaker 2: So my next amendment, the reality is we need to you cannot invest. You're not can't talk about cannabis equity without talking about the fact that we're not investing the resources from the cannabis industry back into the community, that we're impacted by the war on drugs.\nSpeaker 2: This has been something I brought up from the very beginning. It's something we need to do. Councilmember Mongo It's been on the Budget Oversight Committee, the current chair. I want to add to my motion a recommendation to make sure that we invest 50% of proceeds from the cannabis industry back into these communities and back into you.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's shameful that we are not investing cannabis dollars into youth in our city. This has been an issue we've invested in and public safety. We've been generous in homelessness and we're not investing youth or back into the communities impacted.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm offering you a friendly amendment to and you can take the committee and work on it. You can take the committee work on it. I want you to take that on the side of the cannabis dollars.\nSpeaker 6: I love to do that, to commit to that, but I'm not going to accept that as a friendly at this point because it really has nothing to do with the equity program. It has nothing to do with the motion right now.\nSpeaker 2: How about we do this? We are connected with you. How about 100% of the proceeds that are generated from any new cannabis business, new cannabis business, any brick and mortar, any delivery, any share you get back invested into our communities.\nSpeaker 2: That means our impact if you accept that and run. I think there's a fair amount.\nSpeaker 6: I will accept there, too.\nSpeaker 2: All right, Councilman Austin, I'm happy to support this motion.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I'm glad we got there.\nSpeaker 2: It takes time.\nSpeaker 4: This one we.\nSpeaker 6: Learned. Are we on the runway?\nSpeaker 2: I wish you would have just said this two months ago, but you're welcome to have the conversation, because when I look over here, you're up next.\nSpeaker 1: I think that the community should be really proud that there are so many people that care about equity and it doesn't have to be one over the other. It doesn't have to be all of the quote unquote, filibustering and political theater.\nSpeaker 1: I think that we as a council are fortunate to have multiple champions of equity, and I think that that's important in a city. I think that any issue that only has one champion doesn't thrive in the same way.\nSpeaker 1: So I want to be supportive of that. I will ask Councilmember Austin to really seriously consider taking that to your committee. When you talk about revenue, I have worked really hard and it is the same thing I said to Councilmember Richardson a few weeks ago on a different item.\nSpeaker 1: I worked really hard to get restricted funds in place and the city has some really significant fiscal policy reasons why they have not existed in the past. Specifically, it was related to a discussion that also talked about creating false hope for a community, specifically youth.\nSpeaker 1: And if we need to revisit those policies of the city, then let's do that. Let's not break off one agenda item after another, agenda item after another agenda item where we're moving in that direction when staff have made a strong recommendation against it and we have fiscal policies against it.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm I've been a supporter of restricted funds from the beginning. You're going to hear me champion that. I would be happy to do it at economic development, oversight, economic development and finance, as the mayor was so gracious to add in revenue creation and revenue grants to our committee charter when we were recreated in this news cycle\nSpeaker 1: . So I'd be happy to help with that because I do believe that and I've said this before, Bill Fujioka was a CEO of L.A. County and a champion of a lot of great things. And one of them is you eat what you kill.\nSpeaker 1: If something's bringing in the revenue, it should get a bite to invest back into that industry. That group that that that investment I believe in doubling down in the way that when you when you're making some money you pay down your mortgage if you can.\nSpeaker 1: So we need to make those investments that I feel very strongly about it. But I do feel that this will be multiple times in just the first 12 weeks of the year, nine council meetings that we are trying to go around, a policy that we have.\nSpeaker 1: So let's just be honest about it. Let's bring that policy to the council. Let's discuss it on where it doesn't doesn't make sense. I think it's a great conversation to have also with the discussion earlier related to the mention of our fees and our programs and and how those restricted funds can be put back into those communities\nSpeaker 1: . And I think they're really important things to do. So thank you for that. I also want to there was a comment made earlier about me gutting this policy, and I really just don't like that characteristic. I want to think doctor sorrow because I feel that the time had definitely changed from where we were with record unemployment rates\nSpeaker 1: in the city and quite frankly, not a lot of interest from local residents to to become equity applicants and furthermore, their ability to make it to the finish line. I mean, I appreciate what Mr. Austin said related to.\nSpeaker 1: I'm just assuming that they don't have the capital to to get into the brick and mortar ownership side. So I feel that on a weekly basis, I'm learning and I appreciate the comments from Councilman Zoro several weeks back.\nSpeaker 1: And I didn't think the time had come to change that. So thank you for that. And I hope that we as a council can continue to learn from each other and lift each other up and support each other, even when it means changing policies or agenda items or council decisions.\nSpeaker 1: That happened just a few weeks prior because I can't remember who said it. But yes, every single Tuesday we can make a change. We can write a policy or a process this week and next week decide that that that's not the process for us, because sometimes the constituencies haven't had a chance to voice their opinion.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that that circles back to something I've really been hammering with the city manager's office. And I know Councilmember Ortega is a big supporter of this, but communication to our community about all of our strategies and all of our agenda items needs to be timely and in every language, because there are lots of communities that\nSpeaker 1: are impacted by this that are not hearing this council meeting tonight in the language of their choice. And the agenda item was not written in the language of their choice, and we need to be very cognizant of that.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you for everyone who contributed to this, and thank you all for having the courage to bring it forward.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Sorrell.\nSpeaker 1: Well, I want to thank everyone for such a robust conversation again about cannabis equity and inclusion. And I definitely want to I appreciate the questions getting clarified because I was a little bit I needed clarification on why this was coming back.\nSpeaker 1: So before that and I was able to do the report back and I do want to lift up that. You know, I think it's really important that there is a healthy business process for a process and opportunities. Right.\nSpeaker 1: But the thing about this, the heart of this equity program is protecting those who have been victims and criminalized because of the war on drugs. And I want to make sure that there is already a disadvantage point in where we're trying to bring it back to a level of an even playing field.\nSpeaker 1: So that that, I believe, is our job as council member, that we want to make sure there is inclusion, that we prevent further exploitation. And, you know, especially those who have been victim mines by criminalization of the war on drugs.\nSpeaker 1: So that is why I think that for me, it's really important that we take the time to do this right and that we do it thoughtfully, given the study that's been done prior. Right, many months ago that's been shared.\nSpeaker 1: So that's kind of where I'm at on this, is that I just I want to make sure it's done right no matter how many license we have. Right. It could be maybe ten. It could be five. That's not important.\nSpeaker 1: What is important is certain. I mean, certainly the numbers are important, but I think what's important right now is that we do a good process to ensure there's equity inclusion of the applicants. Right. So so I'm happy the ten.\nSpeaker 1: I'm happy of eight. And that's that my focus right now. I'd like to hear more about how we can do it. Right. So that's kind of where I'm at and appreciate the conversation that we ever had to kind of come to the plane being land.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Allen.\nSpeaker 1: I'm the mayor. Yes. I also support the robust. Ah. Appreciate the robust conversations. We our office has heard from a lot of our cannabis cannabis folks tonight about the importance of equity, access and support for future licenses. And retail licenses are really the crown jewel to the social equity question, and currently there aren't any storefront licenses available\nSpeaker 1: to social equity applicants. So I do want to thank everyone who wrote letters and who spoke tonight earlier. I will be supporting this item and support, supporting and specific funding for equity. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Mayor. Mayor, this is Kevin. Can I can I make a quick clarification on the on the timeframe?\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Let me. But I. Sure, go ahead. I have more speakers, but we can do it now. Sure.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Yeah, I'll just. I'll grab a quick. So I just want to clarify the 90 days. So when I spoke about the 90 days that I said that if we were to stop working on the other items and to focus on this particular item, we could probably get it done in 90 days.\nSpeaker 6: So if if we were to have 90 days from today to do the feasibility analysis on the storefront licenses, it would impact the other items. It would it would basically it would probably prevent us from working on the other items.\nSpeaker 6: It would prevent us working on the items. So if we're going to move forward with this, I think the ideal and we want to keep the other initiatives going. I think the the the timing that would work for us is if we could bring this back in September.\nSpeaker 6: Our current work plan for the other items is to provide the come back to Council on the Shared Use Manufacturing Ordinance in June and then shortly thereafter in July, bring the delivery only feasibility analysis back to council. So roughly, you know, 90 days, a little more than 90 days, 90 days from mid-June.\nSpeaker 6: We we could we could get it done, get the feasibility analysis done on the storefront license type in that. That brings us to about mid-September.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much, Councilman Ringo.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mayor. And I agree that this was quite a robust, informative, clarifying. And eventually unifying discussion to to where we got to. Yes. And so I will be supporting the motion table. And I want to agree with I mean, truly sorrow is the newest council member here basically and well, are with Cindy, of course.\nSpeaker 6: So, I mean, they both of you bring these different perspectives to an item that we had been discussing since since I got on the council in 2014. And it was at at that point very contentious and very a lot of debate.\nSpeaker 6: And so to get to this point where we are now, I think is speaks volumes about this city council, about our abilities to listen and and weigh each other's opinions and then come to a come to an agreement as to where we should be.\nSpeaker 6: I want to thank staff for their patience, if you will, with us. But then they get paid for it. So that's what they're supposed to do. But they're also listening, which is great, because that's what we need. We need a staff that is not going to be pushing back.\nSpeaker 6: We need a state that's going to be working with us to get these policies in line to where they should be. So I am totally in agreement with the with the item on the table. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Councilwoman has a.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. And I, too, agree with Councilmember Dunga. I'm very happy that we have finally landed at a place where we can unify and support this item. I am obviously a big supporter of cannabis equity and not only in my district, but city wide.\nSpeaker 1: I think that that is very, very important. I think it is our obligation as city leaders to really always have that, as you know, in our forefront as we move forward through through even through this recovery plan, we really need to focus on being able to give those opportunities and really making sure that we help issue some\nSpeaker 1: of these equitable licenses to those black and brown communities that really, really need it and that I know will thrive because they have our support.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just wanted to chime in now that we've got it worked out, we've heard from the rest of the council. I think, you know, I think it's the right I think it's the right motion where we are.\nSpeaker 2: I would hope that in the future we just work together on these issues. We are districts border by one street. You know, we've had these conversations in the past. This is an open invitation. I care about equity issues.\nSpeaker 2: I don't need to be as involved in every single one of them. I welcome more involvement. And so my hope is we don't have a moment like this again, like healthy discussion. I love the council days and healthy discussion.\nSpeaker 2: Back when Steve Neal Reagan-Bush were on the council, they would spend an hour on an issue and die. I mean, it's hard to do in this virtual format. These are big, big issues. And I just want to make sure that what we do is sincere and we get it right.\nSpeaker 2: So, Councilman Austin, good. Good luck. I'm happy to support it. I want to make sure sincere we do it right and we create some real opportunities for people. What I wouldn't want to see is for the program to say, you know, and you know how proud I am talking about award winning programs.\nSpeaker 2: I want this one of those more permanent programs. Councilman Austin So that's really my sincere hope is that we really can kind of work together on these issues that jointly uplift the communities that we both serve. So thanks a lot.\nSpeaker 2: Happy to support the motion tonight. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. And I want to appreciate all of my colleagues for their comments and your insight. Providing it to this. I think everybody is is certainly sincere in their wishes to get us to a place where more business is more equitable.\nSpeaker 6: This particular in particular cannabis is more equitable in our city. I know I'm sincere. I would not have brought this forward if it weren't for my sincerity in terms of working together. You mentioned we love that it's difficult to do this in a virtual space.\nSpeaker 6: You know, I tried to get us together a couple of weeks ago. You guys push back on that. And so we're here in a virtual space. But I do think we'll be together soon in the council chambers and be able to collaborate in person at some point in the very near future.\nSpeaker 6: Again, I do appreciate the support. I really appreciate the the comments coming from the public. I know there's a lot of young people, there are a lot of individuals who have waited with their ticket and have been quiet for many years now about the opportunity to do this.\nSpeaker 6: And and, you know, it's 810 or new new licenses. It's going to be a competitive process. And we understand that as well. And yes. Or a step is a is a is a great step. We've got a great team here.\nSpeaker 6: I know that they'll be able to get this done in a timely manner and I expect that to happen. Thank you. I'm ready to go to both.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you, Councilman Austin. I think that we're all ready to jump off the plane or something without a parachute, at least in my case. And so when I would go ahead and go to a vote and thank you all for the discussion.\nSpeaker 0: Councilwoman Zendejas.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Allen.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Sapna. I Councilwoman Mango.\nSpeaker 1: I and someone please call 711 for the mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Councilwoman Zahra.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Muranga.\nSpeaker 6: Will collect your parachute, Mayor. I.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 6: Hi.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 2: By.\nSpeaker 0: Bush and Kerry.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. We do have a announcement from the city attorney just as we at least a closed session.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mayor. Mayor and members of the City Council pursuant to Government Code 54 nine.\nSpeaker 2: 57.1.\nSpeaker 5: This afternoon in closed session.\nSpeaker 2: The Long Beach City Council authorized by.\nSpeaker 3: A vote of 9 to 0. The settlement of the matter of McDonald.\nSpeaker 5: Versus City of Long Beach in the amount of.\nSpeaker 2: $701,000. No reportable action as.\nSpeaker 5: To the other three items was.\nSpeaker 2: Taken. Thank you. Thank you. We do have closing remarks and adjournment. Councilwoman Mongo.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Okay. Now we're going to go into our first hearing, which is the CCP hearing. So I just need to make an announcement. I do believe there are a few folks that are outside for CCP, so I know that they can hear me and I know we're going to do a oath for those that want to talk on\nSpeaker 0: the item. So I just want to make sure that we also allow that our our folks are managing the flow of people that we allow. The folks are going to do see CIP to come in and then they can be escorted out.\nSpeaker 0: I guess, however, they're going to do that up up in the up in the back. So let me go ahead and begin by taking the item. We're going to do an oath first, Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 8: All those who intend on participating. Please stand up and raise your right hand.\nSpeaker 0: If you're here for SIP for the planning, I do.\nSpeaker 8: You and each of you solemnly state that the testimony you may give in the cause now and pending before this body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I'm assuming also that there's folks outside that took the oath that want to come in to speak on C-SPAN. Did we arrange that? We're fine. Okay, great. All right, so I will now turn this. Open the hearing and turn this over to staff.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. This item will be presented by Amy Burdick, our director of development.\nSpeaker 9: Services, and Christopher Coons, our advance planning officer.\nSpeaker 10: Mr. Mayor. Members of the.\nSpeaker 2: City council in the audience, thank you very much for your.\nSpeaker 11: Participation and attendance tonight. The sea dip.\nSpeaker 2: Ordinance is 41 years old. It is the.\nSpeaker 11: Oldest planning ordinance.\nSpeaker 3: That we have in the city.\nSpeaker 2: We have spent.\nSpeaker 3: Over three and a half years updating this.\nSpeaker 2: Ordinance, and we were able to do this through the the.\nSpeaker 11: Generosity of the state of California, through a California.\nSpeaker 3: Department of.\nSpeaker 11: Conservation Sustainable Communities.\nSpeaker 3: Planning grant.\nSpeaker 11: Without that almost $1,000,000 contribution, we would not be able to be here today. I'm going to ask Christopher.\nSpeaker 2: Coons to.\nSpeaker 11: Provide an overview.\nSpeaker 3: Of the three and a half year planning process that culminates.\nSpeaker 11: Hopefully this evening. And then also remind you.\nSpeaker 2: With the assistance of Mr. City attorney, that this is an appeal hearing.\nSpeaker 11: So we will go.\nSpeaker 3: Through an appeal process as well.\nSpeaker 11: With that, I'm turning it over to Christopher Coons, her advanced planning officer.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, city council members. And so this evening. We're talking about the southeast area specific plan which will replace Planning District one, also known as CDEP up. So this gives you the general area. You've got Seventh Street, which becomes the 22 and the northern area, you've got PCH Highway one running through the center of the site and\nSpeaker 0: you also see Second Street running through the lower portion of the site. So as Amy mentioned, this is a project that was based on community engagement and was community driven. So this project began with meetings large and small to really establish a community vision of what is it that folks want to see in the southeast part of\nSpeaker 0: Long Beach, not just today, but into the future? And this is a plan that reaches out all the way to 2016, but also deals with our issues today and tomorrow. So on the screen, you see some of our our larger meetings and those ranged from community advisory committee meetings, open houses, workshops, drop ins at farmer's markets and\nSpeaker 0: other places. But these also involved numerous meetings with existing groups and individuals. If there was a group that wanted to have a meeting, we participated in that meeting. We listened to all voices and because of the great participation we received from the public, we were able to craft a plan that we're all proud of and it would\nSpeaker 0: not have been able to happen without that community engagement process. This is the plan from 1977. So this plan represents an outdated approach to development for a few reasons. You'll see on the screen our wetland areas flanking PCH and Second Street were originally and 77 contemplated for development.\nSpeaker 0: That's not an approach we would take today. This plan also does not allow for mixed use. And lastly, it wasn't really a plan. It was a collection of rules compiled based on what had been built and what was anticipated to be built.\nSpeaker 0: But it wasn't driven by a community vision in the same way that the plan currently in front of you today is, which establishes a a clear route to create spaces that will be enjoyable and beneficial to the community as a whole.\nSpeaker 0: So this is the land plan for the item before you this evening. It makes a few major changes. It protects wetland areas and open habitat area. It concentrates the only areas of change on two sites that are already developed today.\nSpeaker 0: So what we're talking about is locations where there are existing shopping centers or existing hotel uses that could be reimagined and redeveloped in the future. It allows for mixed use, which is consistent with its setting. And it provides updated standards, context, sensitive design and a pathway to achieving community benefits.\nSpeaker 0: Key to this plan is enhancing the wetlands and coastal resources. So we talked about setting aside natural areas for protection in perpetuity, but this plan goes further than that and it does include a wetlands restoration and monitoring fund that future projects will be paying into.\nSpeaker 0: And it also includes provisions that every project is built correctly and in deference to its setting adjacent to our wild areas. So what are bird safe treatments? This is something we spent a lot of time on developing during this plan and birth.\nSpeaker 0: Safe treatments come down to three big areas glass plants and lights. So it means making sure that birds of all type can tell the difference between open sky and building glass. It means using plants that are appropriate next to our wetland habitat area.\nSpeaker 0: And those are California native plants. And this will be one of the most progressive plants in the United States. And in terms of landscaping and it means lighting, it means using lighting that's appropriate that lights the building but not surrounding areas.\nSpeaker 0: And it means working together, not just in the design process, but with future residents and businesses to make sure that that light is really limited, especially at night. Lights up for birds. So this plan is really also about creating organic and compelling placemaking as part of development, not just having x square feet of retail or white square\nSpeaker 0: feet of residential, but really having those places where community happens and allowing for community gathering places and a sense of experience. A sense of place and a sense of pride. This is also about building form and architecture and creating something that is really befitting of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: This is our entryway into the city for many visitors every day. And it's we don't have our best face forward today, I think would be the best way to describe it. So it's about creating places that are human scale but are exciting and vibrant and invite a positive image for our city.\nSpeaker 0: It's also about building orientation. So believe it or not, there is a beautiful waterway behind what you know today as Ralph's and Best Buy. You don't know that because those buildings block the view of the water and turn their back on the water.\nSpeaker 0: There is a way to flip that. There is a way to have you corridors to our waterfront and to have a great environment for future residents, current residents and visitors to all enjoy our waterfront, to stop and have a meal, but stay a while, maybe do some shopping, or maybe just come and enjoy the space with your\nSpeaker 0: family and meet some new friends. It's also about open space amenities and creating useful open space between these future buildings that will benefit future residents, current residents and visitors. So it's also about including the streetscape. During our outreach process, there are a lot of different adjectives used by the community to describe PCH.\nSpeaker 0: Most people did not describe it as beautiful or as the best street in Long Beach or as something they were particularly proud of. So part of this plan is really about changing that engagement between the built environment and the street and having buildings that have interesting and exciting edges with the street.\nSpeaker 0: It's also about increasing connectivity. We know that we are a city of cars and many folks will continue to drive. But it's also about giving people other choices, including biking and walking and improving the environment for all forms of mobility.\nSpeaker 0: To that end, this project increases bicycle lane miles in the area by 79%, 29% increase in pedestrian facilities and a 9% increase in roadways for cars. This just gives you an idea of the reimagining of PCH. So this shot here is sort of approaching the Marina Pacifica shopping center today.\nSpeaker 0: So imagine separated bike lanes where you feel safe, new planting medians, trees and somewhere that you're not just comfortable, but somewhere that you want to return to because you have a positive experience in terms of positive, increased connectivity.\nSpeaker 0: The most common concern about the project was about the traffic at Second and PCH. There's some things that we can do, but there are limits to what we can do about traffic. So one of the ideas we're doing in this plan is breaking up the super blocks and making sure that if you don't have to go through\nSpeaker 0: that intersection, you don't have to go through that intersection, that you can get around different sites and that you have an internal street grid instead of the giant super blocks that you see out there today. So if I'm a resident in Naples and I'm trying to get where Ralph says today, there's no need for me to go\nSpeaker 0: through that second and PCH intersection. Once we have a better functioning internal street grid and I can get through the different sites without going through that major intersection. So I was asked to keep it brief. But just in summary, I think what we've done with this plan is really try to accomplish a community goal.\nSpeaker 0: We did that through coming up with development standards that were sufficient to attract private investment and create all these amenities and improvements that we talked about, but are also scaled appropriate to their setting and this unique location near the water and near our great wild areas.\nSpeaker 0: So that concludes the staff presentation and we're available here at the staff table for all your questions. Okay. Now, of course, this is a a hearing. So the way this works is the city has made a presentation. There is an.\nSpeaker 0: Appellant We have one. Appellant Correct me if I'm wrong is Mr. City Attorney. So the one appellant has asked for 15 minutes, so we will do 15 minutes for the one. Appellant And is he just come on down?\nSpeaker 0: And we will also I know that the appellant has also asked for rebuttal time. So what we'll do is if there is additional comments after this by staff, then we'll grant the rebuttal time. If there's not, then there's obviously no need for the rebuttal time if there isn't any additional comments.\nSpeaker 0: Sounds good. Okay, let's go ahead. And, Madam Clerk, you'll have the time.\nSpeaker 12: Thank so much, honorable mayor and City Council for having us here today. My name is Warren Lisowski. I'm the president of Long Beach, Citizens for Fair Development. Mr. Salisbury, we're taking notes. I'm actually the president of the organization.\nSpeaker 12: I'd like to start out today to thank staff for their presentation and just point out a couple of issues that I don't have the agenda in front of me. So City Council and Honorable Mayor, I ask you to look at each of these decisions that are being made individually.\nSpeaker 12: Very often decisions come before you and there are many items that are grouped together. So let's just break down exactly what's happening today. The staff is proposing that you repeal and replace the existing PD one set up. It is our position that, yes, leadership is inadequate due to the age.\nSpeaker 12: But see, this does have vital protections for the wetlands. And so instead of repealing and replacing c dep CDEP could have been updated in such a way to protect the wetlands better. Just a couple comments directly related to the staff's report.\nSpeaker 12: If you remember when we did study sessions in these chambers, the members of the public commented that whatever happened at those community meetings was not accurately reflected in the document. So I just let the record to be clear that the citizens feel that what happened at those study sessions is not in the documents.\nSpeaker 12: I've given you each a letter, a three page letter outlining some of the problems. What we've got here is we can't look at just this as a zoning change we have, and we must look at the totality of what's going on in the southeast area.\nSpeaker 12: Let's remember that a brand new gas fired power plant was just approved by S.C. The planning commission here has approved three seven story buildings filled with 90,000 gallons of lithium ion battery, the same stuff that was in the note five when you couldn't bring a milliliter of it on the airplane.\nSpeaker 12: They want to put 90,000 gallons of it on the wetlands with no additional fire resource and also with no environmental review. The Planning Commission simply approved a mitigated negative declaration for the Battery Tower. If this if this if you vote yes on all of this today, what we are going to end up with is not what?\nSpeaker 12: Not wetlands protection. There is going to be 80 foot buildings if a hotel mixed use is used under the plan. The biology in this environmental impact report is woefully inadequate. It does not talk about how the biological resources will be preserved in light of these 80 story buildings.\nSpeaker 12: I would like to draw your attention back to the local coastal planning program. The local coastal program was adopted after set up in 1980 as under the California Coastal Act and. The the local coastal plan says that the conservation goals and policies of the Coastal Act should be are there for the preservation of all those through those\nSpeaker 12: wetlands. The local coastal plan also describes CDEP and the accompanying resource management plan as being inextricably intertwined. And so really the way these documents are written, the local coastal plan, sea depth and the resource management plan, they really cannot be extracted from one another.\nSpeaker 12: So if you are repealing PD one side, if you're also repealing those portions of the local coastal plan and the resource management plan included within. A couple other problems. As the low Cerritos Wetlands Trust pointed out in their letter from their attorney, Michelle Black, The Post reads, This plan is inconsistent with the general plan.\nSpeaker 12: Why? Why is this body spending time to update a specific plan when we know that the general plan does not conform to state guidelines? So wouldn't it make more sense to update the general plan first and then update the specific plans to be in line with that?\nSpeaker 12: Also, there's a new government code section 60 50302 that stems from Senate Bill 1000. It's the environmental justice piece of general plans. Now, staff at a earlier meeting stated that these new elements that are being passed have paid some type of service to the Environmental Justice under Senate Bill 1000 with the people of Long Beach wants.\nSpeaker 12: What the environmentalists want is we want what the state Senate voted for us and what the governor signed into law. We want an environmental justice element, not just environmental justice, to be dealt with from time to time in the different elements of the general plan.\nSpeaker 12: Let's talk about the certification of the final air today. California Environmental Quality Act secure its its California's broadest environmental law and secure it gives the fullest protection of the environment within reason, the fullest protection. This plan does not give the force protection.\nSpeaker 12: This is a development plan. This is an oil drilling plan. Even though the misnamed Wetlands Restoration Program, which more aptly should be named the 50 year oil drilling in the wetlands program, is not in front of you today.\nSpeaker 12: That land exchange or oil drilling plan cannot happen without this CDEP being repealed. So I'd like you to take a second to think about the gravity of what you're doing today. You've got an environmental protection on our last remaining wetlands, and Long Beach staff is asking you to remove those protections and replace them with a development plan\nSpeaker 12: allowing 80 foot tall hotels in the buffer areas around the wetlands. The California Coastal Commission sent a letter from a scientist named Kate Kate Hochul Bridge regarding the wetlands, oil consolidation and Restoration Project. And she's got 32 pages from the Coastal Commission about about the problems with these plans.\nSpeaker 12: So let's not forget that this sea dep and this oil drilling are one in the same. Let's go back to the local coastal plan that was adopted in 1980. The local coastal plan states that the city shall ask the Coastal Commission for aid and funding to effect the determination of the location and boundaries of the wetlands and\nSpeaker 12: their buffer areas for restoration. IT when we were here about the pool, the Belmont Pool Project, the attitude of this body and the staff was, let's ask for the biggest project we can and then let Coastal Commission trim it down.\nSpeaker 12: I remember Councilman Iran, I didn't think that was maybe the best idea. Coastal Commission staff is right here in downtown Long Beach. Your staff can meet with Coastal Commission. You can form these policies together. You don't have to ask for something that's outsized, that's damaging to the environment.\nSpeaker 12: And then have Coastal Commission object to it. This can be this can happen in a more collaborative setting. Another way that the air is inadequate is there's something called the Low Cerritos Channel Watershed Group. It's made up of the cities of Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Lakewood, Long Beach, Paramount and Signal Hill and the L.A. County Flood District.\nSpeaker 12: There's a watershed management program. This document in the jurisdiction section of the air did not come up at all. That's just one reason why the air is inadequate. I wanted to respond to a couple more of staff's points.\nSpeaker 12: There was a beautiful slide called Placemaking. I went to high school in Long Beach. Placemaking was not a word. Okay. That's a made up word by the consultant. I think they've got place in the name of their business.\nSpeaker 12: That's the same consultant that's doing the Dewey Plan that brought 60 people here to object to it. So our recommendation is stop using place works. They don't. They do not. Their values and the residents of Long Beach values are do not resonate with each other.\nSpeaker 12: Environmentalists and community activists. We don't want place works here in Long Beach. One more thing is staff had a beautiful slide called building orientation, talking about the the underused backside portion facing the Marina Pacifica condos from Best Buy and Ralphs.\nSpeaker 12: Some beautiful pictures there. They've got sailboats sailing down the channel there. It makes me think that these consultants have never even been there before because everyone knows you can't have a sailboat sailing down between Marina Pacifica condos and Best Buy.\nSpeaker 12: So if they have spent time there. Once again, I do not think they have an understanding of how the southeast area of Long Beach operates. Couple other points here, because I do want to save a few minutes. Let's think about where we are in the world right now.\nSpeaker 12: Let's think about what's happened the last few months. Let's look at the horrible hurricane in Houston. I mean, Houston, we all heard it on the news. We all heard it from the commentary. Unchecked development was the cause of a lot of that flooding, unchecked development in Houston.\nSpeaker 12: The developers were allowed to build wherever they want, and that ended up with freeways being below sea level. And that led to the death and destruction on top of what was already a horrible natural disaster. Let's think about what's in that water that those people had to wade through.\nSpeaker 12: That was the biggest oil production facility in the world there on the Texas coast. And now it's become a toxic soup that those people are going to have to live with for the rest of their lives. We have yet to see the spike in cancer, the spike in miscarriage.\nSpeaker 12: We don't know what the health effects are going to be. Now, let's look at the low street, those wetlands that are going to be unprotected if you pass this law tonight. We know sea level rise is imminent. We know there's an earthquake fault running across the wetlands between the oil production facilities.\nSpeaker 12: All it takes is a small tsunami. It could be a couple of feet tall. All it could take is a couple of feet of storm surge. And all those oil operations and all that residential area. And your beautiful pictures of PCH will be covered in the same toxic soup that's covering Houston right now.\nSpeaker 12: We demand that that does not happen. We beg of you to not pass this resolution. There's a couple of other things regarding development. I know staff really wants to put these tall, mixed use buildings in the L.A. Times yesterday.\nSpeaker 12: Downtown Los Angeles has a 20% residential vacancy rate. People can't pay 30 $500 for a one bedroom apartment. Something else that's lacking with this E.R. and why it should not be certified is the cumulative impacts are lacking. This body's proposing to certify a specific plan.\nSpeaker 12: Er it's a programmatic element. That Environment Impact Report does not mention the Battery Towers. It does not mention the battery plans. It does not mention the land swap. So California's Sequoia insists that the cumulative impacts of any environmental projects be recognized.\nSpeaker 12: And finally, this. This area falls under the Clean Water Act. These are waters of America. And even though our current administration wants to redefine the waters of America to a more narrow definition, this body should stand up and protect the waters of America.\nSpeaker 12: And finally, what do we want? We want you to delay this vote. This body has broad powers to change the land use via the general plan zones and the specific zoning zones. So what we're asking you to do is to start to break long beaches, addiction to oil and fossil fuels.\nSpeaker 12: California has set a 2040 zero emissions goal. How does a 50 year oil drilling plan in step help a zero emissions goal? Let's follow some of the leaders. When the president said that the people of Pittsburgh didn't vote for Paris, that the people of Pittsburgh voted for him, the Pittsburgh mayor came back and said, no, we didn't\nSpeaker 12: vote for that. And in fact, Pittsburgh has a zero emission goal by 2030. Companies like Volvo are going to stop making combustion engines. So Long Beach is progressive in many ways. This body is progressive in many ways. And we strongly encourage you to be progressive in your thought for the southeast area and preserve the wetlands that we\nSpeaker 12: have. If I could reserve the last minute. I appreciate it, Mr. Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: And so I'm asking you reserving the last minute for rebuttal or for that?\nSpeaker 12: I could have 5 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Those are some things you can reserve for your other minute. If you want to finish the last minute.\nSpeaker 12: I'll just reserve whatever time for rebuttal you would be.\nSpeaker 0: So. Okay. So you're going to get 5 minutes for rebuttal. Thank you. Okay, then we're going to turn this back over to two staff and guys. Guys. So let me let's just try to get through the hearing as expeditiously as possible.\nSpeaker 0: So we're gonna turn over to staff and then after staff does any additional comments, then, Mr. Foss, you have a chance to do a rebuttal, and then we'll do we'll go to the public and of course, the deliberations of the Council.\nSpeaker 0: So. Mr. Motorcar.\nSpeaker 4: Mr. Bullock, Ms.. Burdick will give a short rebuttal.\nSpeaker 3: Actually, I'm going.\nSpeaker 11: To ask Christopher to start, but I just do want to make one correction. For the record, the appellant said 80 stories.\nSpeaker 3: I think I would ask the appellant to.\nSpeaker 11: Agree that he really meant 80 feet.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I could even council members. So the majority of what you heard is addressed in their written record in the staff report in front of you. I draw your particular attention to the resolution in front of you. Certifying the E.R. includes findings of fact that address the adequacy of the document.\nSpeaker 0: I do want to talk about the speaker referenced several related projects in the area and a number of years ago. So over three years ago, when we embarked on this process, the city council at that time declined to do any type of moratorium or interim controls while we were preparing this plan.\nSpeaker 0: So, staff, the city has a legal obligation to process applications as they come in based on the laws that are on the books at the time. So the appellant referenced a CC power plant which is replacing existing power plant with a cleaner one that not a city project that's under the jurisdiction of the Energy Commission.\nSpeaker 0: He referenced the a battery storage facility that was approved by the Planning Commission by Mr. Pisarski. His appeal on that separate project is pending at this time. He referenced the Beach Oil Minerals Partner Project, which Mr. Boesky objected that project in writing during the E.R. but that project has not yet come to hearing.\nSpeaker 0: So beyond that, placemaking is a defined term. There's a whole document about it from the Project for Public Spaces. If people are interested in not all of the projects, most mentioned by Mr. Lisowski are accounted for in the cumulative analysis of the document.\nSpeaker 0: So beyond that, I want to be deferential to the Council's time and we can dove into any of the issues that were brought up. But they are all addressed in your written materials, particularly in those squat findings that are attached to the air certification resolution prepared by the city attorney.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We're going to have the the appellant please can do. Rebuttal.\nSpeaker 12: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Koonce with response with regards to the California Energy Commission's approval and jurisdiction of the new power plant. Yes, the city does not have jurisdiction, but the city does have zoning and general plan control.\nSpeaker 12: What does that mean? The city could have entered into the S.E.C. process with a generating station as an intervenor. The city could have done what was best for the people of Long Beach and intervened and said, Why do we need another 500 megawatt fossil fuel generating station on our wetlands?\nSpeaker 12: So that brings us to yes, there are all these other projects, but let's talk about what this council can do with zoning. I'm going to throw a couple of ideas out here. One of the ideas is. When this new oil drilling plan comes into effect.\nSpeaker 12: I know it's still up in the air, but in all likelihood it's going to be approved. You could add to the zone that any oil drilling, any injection waste, any water injection or chemical injections that those oil developers have to provide a list of all the chemicals that are being injected into the ground.\nSpeaker 12: That's a very simple change. As you know, the petroleum industry wants to keep those thousands of chemicals as proprietary. And so under Prop 65, we don't even know what carcinogens are in there. There are all kinds of different benzene and crazy aromatic rings that are carcinogenic.\nSpeaker 12: And then finally, with regards to the specific zoning and the general plan, there are guidelines that the state gives you and there are things that are out of your jurisdiction. But this city council, this body, is given the power of zoning, and that's a very powerful tool.\nSpeaker 12: And so when you say that the battery tower hasn't been approved, but it's going to go on the wetlands, you could tonight simply add a piece to this new cap that says we don't allow over one gallon or 89,000 gallons of lithium ion flash flammable fluid to be on the wetlands.\nSpeaker 12: So that is the control you have. One final thought about Mr. Koons and the staff's idea of the inevitability of land use. Yes, certain land uses are by right. We understand that. But the way that staff has often positioned that in front of the council and the planning commission is that the commission and the council must extend\nSpeaker 12: those land uses by rights to other decisions that are not by right. For example, I'm going to bring in an outside example just to make this point and then I'll wrap up. 320 Alamitos Street What came up before Planning Commission?\nSpeaker 12: They were asking for a building with residential units and it was also on two lots. And staff told the Planning Commission that you have to approve this project because it's buy right for them to build those many units.\nSpeaker 12: You can't change the downtown plan parking ratios without changing the downtown plan. What they failed to let the commission know was that they did not have to buy right approved the lot merger and if they would have simply not approved the Lot merger, then that development could have been squelched.\nSpeaker 12: So don't let staff pull your power out from under you. There are things that you can do to make a difference. You can give landowners their rights and at the same time do what's right for the city of Long Beach and for our wetlands.\nSpeaker 12: Thanks so much, Mr. Mayor. Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Okay. We're going to go ahead now and move on to the rest of the hearing. So we've closed both the applicant out, which is the city in this case, of course, the presenter and the appellant and the time for both the presentation.\nSpeaker 0: The rebuttal is now closed. We're going to go to public comment only those that, of course, swore in to the oath and those that are here for this item. So if you didn't see the swearing in, please, please come down to the podium and present yourself, of course, your name for the record.\nSpeaker 0: And again, just line up on this and we'll get through these comments and then back to the Council for deliberation on the Ccep item. Yes, sir.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor and City Council. Hi. My name is Bob Paternoster. I'm happy to be here this evening. When I. When I first, I'm going to give you just a little historical context for this project. When I moved to Long Beach in 1977, my first important job as director of planning and building was to try to bring\nSpeaker 4: closure to the city planning process. The Planning Commission had already appointed a citizens advisory committee. I was pleased that this evening when I came in here and found that Jan Hall, who was head head of that committee, was president, of course she was later Councilwoman Jan Hall, and that that committee consisted of residents, property owners and developers\nSpeaker 4: . That committee had already created a vision for Sea-Tac when I arrived. And that vision was basically that they wanted something like Irvine. I remember back at 1977, Irvine was just blossoming and people were looking at it very fondly.\nSpeaker 4: And the committee, like the mix of housing units, they were willing to accept smaller than the standard size lot for residential development if the developer would provide lots of open space, bicycle trails and so forth. But at that time, they were deadlocked because the citizens, even though they knew what they wanted, they did not trust the city\nSpeaker 4: to implement that. They did not trust the city to force developers to build that open space in those and those and those. Trails and so forth, because plain old zoning R1, R3 just doesn't do that. And the one small contribution that I think I made to the process was to tell them that there are other land use\nSpeaker 4: controls that you can use besides standard zoning. For instance, a plan development district. And once they realize that that the the law could require developers to build open space, to build the trails, the bike trails and so forth.\nSpeaker 4: Then the plan was forward to city council adopted and you had PD one, the first plan development district in the city. Now the plan, the city plan did focus on the area north of the luxury trust channel and residential development because that was where the vacant land was.\nSpeaker 4: And since the time of adoption, we've had the construction of a Bixby village with the golf course of the Largo, with Simms Pond of Bay Harbor, Spinnaker Bay, Spinnaker, coves with a new waterfront development not only for a boat boat docks, but also a continuous public walkway along all of that waterfront throughout there.\nSpeaker 4: And all of these villages tied together by the city's first class one bike path through residential areas. The wetland was recognized and preserved now after adoption of the plan. It was expanded when we went through the LCP, but it was preserved, as was the the Pacific Flyway.\nSpeaker 4: There was little concern, quite frankly, for affordability of housing at the time, although we did preserve the the mobile home park and apartments were mixed in with single family residential. But you have to realize what the attitude of the city was back in 1977.\nSpeaker 4: At that time. Young, upwardly mobile family.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Sorry. Time is up. Oh, I know. Sorry about that.\nSpeaker 4: All right. Let me just end by saying I encourage I encourage you to move forward with adopting the plan. It's been 40 years and it's about time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Yeah, we've got to watch the time, especially tonight, because we have a lot of items from SL.\nSpeaker 3: Watch the time. Even though I don't like it's so short. My name is Jan Hollings, former city councilwoman for the third district in the city of Long Beach, and, as Bob indicated, chair of the original city of committee.\nSpeaker 3: I'm here to say that I am opposed to the proposed changes to see death for very specific reasons. There's a lot of good in that plan that's being proposed, but the things that can't seem to be taken care of, in my opinion.\nSpeaker 3: Our number one traffic. The city of Long Beach and this end of town are going to be inundated by lots of changes in the traffic without any development. The widening of the four or five freeway in Orange County is going to bring a tremendous increase again on Seventh Street in the Long Beach area.\nSpeaker 3: Four lanes of new traffic and it stops at seventh Street. Those cars are going to go somewhere and they are going to impact the Cedar Area and by extension, the areas in the third district. The concern I have about the density is one that is merely an observation that currently there is not a complete build out of\nSpeaker 3: density that's currently allowed in the city plan. I think we're pushing our luck if we keep adding more people without some kind of traffic solutions. Number three, the idea of the height limits currently the height limit is is three stories, as you all know, and is being proposed to be 5 to 7 stories.\nSpeaker 3: I think that that kind of height will really create a very different. The situation on Pacific Coast Highway then is in being envisioned by the planning department and the consultants. And by that I mean is that if you have five and seven story buildings along Pacific Coast Highway, effectively from Lloyd's Drive to the SEAL Beach border, you\nSpeaker 3: really are creating a barrier along that whole stretch of land. I know there'll be some adjustments to build it back, but I am concerned that that barrier will change the entire atmosphere in the third district and kind of undo what basically has been created in the third district.\nSpeaker 3: And so with those for those reasons and several others, I just would like to issue my propose my opposition to this proposal. And thanks, Suzy Pryce as the councilwoman. It's a tough decision and it isn't going to be easy no matter what.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor and City Councilmember. My name is Randy Gordon.\nSpeaker 4: I am president and CEO of Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. On behalf of the Chamber and our leadership, we strongly support, she said, which all of you know is a huge opportunity for Long Beach, not just from a business perspective, but so many.\nSpeaker 0: Other ways as well. The plan will allow for mixed use projects with.\nSpeaker 4: Residential, retail, commercial and hotels. This will create thousands of new construction jobs related jobs over the course of the next 10 to 15 years. It will attract a new high end retail, which will create thousands of jobs for residents and most importantly, will keep sales tax revenue in Long Beach that now migrates to south to Orange County\nSpeaker 0: . We see the opportunity for.\nSpeaker 4: Incredible economic synergism with Long Beach State, the retail, residential communities in Naples and Belmont Shore and all other communities throughout the city. And as far as potential projects as they come online, we absolutely believe this will assist the east side of Long Beach to start driving sales tax.\nSpeaker 0: Dollars north to our city.\nSpeaker 4: From SEAL Beach, Huntington Beach and other nearby areas. It will.\nSpeaker 0: Create a beautiful gateway that our city.\nSpeaker 4: Desperately needs and deserves to welcome visitors from our communities and will help all of us who are working to promote Long Beach as a great place to bring your business. Also included in the plan, it's a benefit to the environment.\nSpeaker 4: It provides funding through development fees and other grants to improve the current declining wetlands. Lastly, and probably the biggest impact to the city and the reasons enough to pass this tonight, it will create millions of dollars annually to the city through sales tax and property tax revenue.\nSpeaker 0: As a.\nSpeaker 4: Resident.\nSpeaker 0: Just down.\nSpeaker 4: The street in Bay Harbor, I am absolutely convinced this is the right thing to do at the right time. And our members and our leadership. We urge you to vote for this proposal.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for allowing these comments to be in the record. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, mayor and city council members.\nSpeaker 10: My name is Sarah Wilkes Fong and I am here on behalf of the Los Angeles County Business Federation. Base Fed is a massive, diverse grassroots alliance of 165 business organizations, with over 325,000 employers.\nSpeaker 2: With over 3 million employees throughout Los Angeles County.\nSpeaker 10: That advocates for policies and projects that strengthen our regional economy. We are in strong support of the adoption of the Southeast Area Specific Plan.\nSpeaker 2: A comprehensive and thoughtful, thoughtful blueprint to guide future development. See, RCEP will not only enhance the area quality of life for Long Beach residents, but also gives the business community the ability incentive.\nSpeaker 10: To reinvest in the area.\nSpeaker 2: New mixed land designation designations, updated design guidelines and infrastructure improvements will give property owners the flexibility to create new residential, commercial and employment opportunities that fit the vision of the city. This update.\nSpeaker 10: Helps to replace.\nSpeaker 2: Outdated plan planning with a specific plan that will balance sustainability, economic development and livability.\nSpeaker 10: We appreciate the city staff's.\nSpeaker 2: Dedication to bring forward this detailed plan, and we urge the city council.\nSpeaker 10: To adopt it. Thank you for your consideration.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor and City Council.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Bill Thomas. I'm a resident of the Alamitos Heights and past president.\nSpeaker 4: Of Elm Estates Association, which is adjacent to the property.\nSpeaker 1: Area under.\nSpeaker 4: Discussion. I was also involved quite a few years ago when Councilman DeLong was brought the initial study proposal up, and it didn't make any progress. I'm speaking today as a member of the advisory committee. That is off the record.\nSpeaker 4: I believe the record will show over attended all of the advisory committee meetings, a very large number of the city, the community gathering meetings. And I must compliment the staff and the Place Works group that have done a magnificent job of hearing.\nSpeaker 1: All kinds of suggestions and reaching out to every conceivable interest. And I would.\nSpeaker 4: Just quite amazed at how well that progress went. And I'm very much in price in favor of the project that looks out 50 years, not back 50 years, and what.\nSpeaker 1: The city can expect from its citizens and from.\nSpeaker 4: Its businesses in the area to make a better place for all citizens to live, work and enjoy the great aspects of the city of Long Beach and strongly endorse you or request your positive endorsement of the project. Thank you very.\nSpeaker 0: Much. Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. And Cantrell and I am a member of Carp, which is citizens about responsible planning. Although not mentioned by the staff, the Planning Commission has recommended the reduced intensity alternative and reduction in height on the marketplace parcel.\nSpeaker 3: Even this is not enough. I urge the Council to choose the No project slash CDP alternative. If you reject this, at least reduce the duced intensity of alternative to one story buildings on all in the within 300 feet of the wetlands and require three storey buildings in the rest of the area and take any new oil development\nSpeaker 3: out of this plan. I have worked to change CDEP for 20 years because of two threats extending Studebaker Road through the wetlands and allowing homes on the wetlands. This has been eliminated with this plan, but what we've gotten with C CIP is many times worse.\nSpeaker 3: Over 5400 additional residential units, five story buildings on property surrounding the wetlands, extension of Shop Keeper Road through the wetlands, seven story hotels. And they say the significant, unavoidable impacts are going to occur in air quality cultural resources, greenhouse gas, emission, noise, transportation and traffic.\nSpeaker 3: That means nothing's going to be done. About those 5 to 7 story buildings are a menace for birds. Bird safe glass is being required on only 90% of the buildings. It should be on everyone. The FDA, the FBI are future further states that only the areas facing the wetlands will receive bird safe treatment.\nSpeaker 3: In other words, birds flying out of the wetlands will be protected. Those flying into the wetlands will be striking 60 to 80 foot buildings with untreated gap glass. Another danger to wetland wildlife was not mentioned in this air.\nSpeaker 3: And it goes with new dwelling units right next to the wetlands. With that comes domestic pets.\nSpeaker 2: Not don't.\nSpeaker 3: Not all owners keep their dogs and cats inside or on leash. Even one dog or cat can be devastating to breeding success of many of the ground nesting birds. The California Coastal Act requires public access to the coast and restricts what development is allowed in coastal areas.\nSpeaker 3: Coastal lighted buildings are allowed. Residential is not.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much, Nick Speaker.\nSpeaker 3: I will I will give you the rest of my comments.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Miss Cantrell. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor and distinguished counsel. People, you all look very, very, very nice tonight. Very distinguished. Thank you. Thank you. My name is Ricardo Perdomo, and I'm a local business person. I've had the pleasure of living in the island, Naples Island, for about 15 years now.\nSpeaker 4: And it's just a great, great neighborhood. And I mean, I just love Long Beach when people ask me, where do you live? I say, I live in Long Beach, and they're like, Why the heck do you want to live in Long Beach?\nSpeaker 4: Well, obviously we don't know what communities we have and everything that the City of Long Beach has to offer. That being said, I want to thank everybody here on the panel for all your hard work in making the city a much greater place to live.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And I'm also here in in April, the actual project. We really want to see something different in our community. We really believe in speaking with many of my neighbors and many of the people that live here in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: They're just really, really tired of actually going through that community, that part of our community, that that part of our city and just seeing what is there now. My city has so much to offer and people don't know about it.\nSpeaker 4: So this could actually be really one of the huge focus points entryway that can really showcase our city. The project is going to help. Attracting people to our city, is going to have new families, young professionals and just really, really showcase our city.\nSpeaker 4: I also appreciate the fact that this also has written in the plan where it's going to actually help preserve and restore the wetlands. Thank you guys very much as well for pushing the bike paths and the walk and the walking paths.\nSpeaker 4: That's a really great thing to have and this project is also going to help. I actually having those those incorporated into their into their project. That's one of the big selling points that sells our city as a forward thinking city.\nSpeaker 4: Help us make the city shine. Approve this project. Thank you very much. I encourage you say yes on this project. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And before we go to the next speaker, we do have folks in line. Obviously, a lot of public comment as well as outside for this item. So we're going down to 2 minutes unless there's any objection from the council.\nSpeaker 0: If there's an objection, we'll go back to three C. No objection. Madam Clerk, we're going out of 2 minutes. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. My name is Susan Phillips. I live at 6125 East Ocean Boulevard. I'm not particularly opposed to this project, but I'm opposed to some of the parts of this project. I feel that if we're going to say 3 to 5 stories and then it says a little caveat down at the bottom seven storeys with an okay by\nSpeaker 3: a committee, I'd like to know which committee it is like. Is it you? Is it the city manager's office? Is it the developers? Is it the planning commission? I think if we're going to say 3 to 5 storeys, we should say 3 to 5 storeys, period.\nSpeaker 3: I think we should have some rules about it. Long Beach has always been a city of neighborhoods, and I hope that whatever we're doing, we don't just develop. The city is called us now an urban area. And I hope that within the planning that we're choosing to do, we can maintain the independence of our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 3: It's really important to the beauty of Long Beach, and we all live here because we love our neighborhoods. And the last thing I like to say is just about this process, just in case, you know, the pit, the pictures that you saw up there when they were showing the open area, the first part that look really pretty\nSpeaker 3: , those were two storey buildings. I don't know if anybody noticed that about that area. So we're kind of being manipulated here, I feel, because when I went to the Planning Commission meeting, they talked about Bella Terra. So I went out and saw Bella Terra and it's an asphalt jungle.\nSpeaker 3: And so I just want you to think about the fact of what we're picking and what we're choosing. That's all. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, honorable mayor. Members of the city council. My name is Jeff Hoffman. I'm a lifelong resident of Long Beach, living in Naples, less than a mile from the intersection of Second and PCH il. The city is going in such a great direction.\nSpeaker 4: We see what's been happening uptown with some of the new development up there we've been seeing. What's been happening downtown, I mean, is evident. All the great things that are happening when we drive around here and we we want that for our east side gateway is well, if this has been a really good process over the past\nSpeaker 4: few years, we've attended the workshops. We've had an opportunity to sit around the table with people who who disagree with us, but that are still neighbors like the person who spoke just before me. So I think it's been a great process, but it's also a really good plan.\nSpeaker 4: I think the consultants, I think city staff from the Planning Department have done a really good job taking in all of the input from various points of view. You know, I don't think it's a perfect plan. There's things that I would love in it, but there's people in this room that would absolutely hate the things that I\nSpeaker 4: would have loved. So I think it's a good compromise and is a wonderful opportunity for us to move forward and have some really good development while restoring the wetlands. So I encourage you all to vote for the city plan.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for the testimony. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Very good. You. I've been following this since Gary too long. Wanted to build a 70 story tower with a flea market on every corner. One of the. And also, let me start with the one thing I was glad somebody pointed out.\nSpeaker 4: I've never pointed out before, but it's inane when they show the picture of a sailboat down in the channel behind BestBuy and reading Pacifica, obviously, and then a sailor they'd never heard of being in irons. You can't sell their period.\nSpeaker 4: What was intriguing and interesting is the cut through in terms of and I've often thought about this and I'm sure other people have and I hope they put that in there, is that they can put a cut through.\nSpeaker 4: So when you come down the aisle, you're able to cut through the Marina Pacifica behind a behind Albertson's, behind a whatever they are, Gelson's and zip across without having to go through the intersection. The intersection itself raises the point of something I really think should be done before we move forward, and that is study the concept of\nSpeaker 4: a traffic circle, just like we have at where our traffic circle is. They're used all around the world. I know some people don't like them. There's some people that don't like to cross that bridge of the what these speakers pointed out last week, they were at the last planning commission meeting that has a business on Second Street\nSpeaker 4: that quite frankly, during the week there will be not that much business period in the restaurants, the foot, the floors, the businesses on the second floor, nicely designed or simply not have that traffic certainly during the week. I am troubled and I don't I don't know the answer relative to solving all the environmental issues, but I challenge\nSpeaker 4: this council to come up with the best possible solution so we don't destroy it. Thank you. The environment.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 4: Next speaker, please. My name is Michael Fields. I live at 6171, Laguna Hart Court in Bay Harbor. And we are live behind a community business area called Marina Plaza, which I request that you look at the map on page four.\nSpeaker 4: It's a little triangle in the center of the plan here, and it allows for a 3 to 5 story remaking of that particular project. And it makes no sense in that little tiny space, right, right behind our community to go up 3 to 5 stories if they want to put a hotel there.\nSpeaker 4: And it goes up to seven stories. Look how tiny that little that little spot is there. And what I read, though, the zoning requirements there was an exception for the in and out burger at one story. I don't know why there's one story, not burger.\nSpeaker 4: And this little small community here runs up from if they remake it 3 to 5 stories doesn't make sense. It's just going to be a congested area. It's not going to be favorable to the people in the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 4: And I request that you remake that zoning requirement of three or four, 3 to 5 stories and a limited to one story only. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, City Council. My name is Gordon and I live in the third district. I'm here to ask you to seriously consider the alternatives that have been proposed to you this evening regarding less density, less traffic, and less height.\nSpeaker 3: On this plan, I'm opposed to it because I believe firmly that this is a development plan and not a plan for the protection of wetlands. I'm here to tell you, I was here at City Hall the evening that this grant was announced by our city staff.\nSpeaker 3: I was delighted to hear that the city would get resources in order to do something about this plan. I'm equally dismayed to stand up here tonight and tell you that the process was flawed. Those community meetings were held.\nSpeaker 3: There were 200 people who attended over the course of time. Where were the hundreds and thousands of people who should have been participating in this process? Vice Mayor Richardson, did any of these meetings happen in your district? Councilman, you were on.\nSpeaker 3: Did any of these meetings happen in your district? Do you ever drive to the second and PCH intersection? Do you think this should have been discussed outside of the third district? I'm an advocate for process. This process was flawed.\nSpeaker 3: This project is flawed. It is too high. It is too dense. There's too much traffic. There's not enough mitigation for those valuable wetlands that need to be restored in the third district of Long Beach. And I ask that you seriously consider alternatives.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Deena Dach. I have lived in this community for approximately 50 years. I'm a California certified naturalist for the state. I am also. This last year, I've been honored to be the national education director for NMDA, and I am saddened by what we look at.\nSpeaker 3: Ed in this community. In Huntington Beach, it took 25 years for them to salvage and save the wetlands. You probably all notice it as you drive down Pacific Coast Highway. You probably all notice that people are using it for educational value.\nSpeaker 13: That they take a look at it and say, Isn't.\nSpeaker 3: It great that we have 3% of what was once 100% of the wetlands here in California, in the community where we can make a difference is here, Long Beach, we can look at our wetlands and we can see whether or not.\nSpeaker 13: There's a possibility that we could control ourselves and stay to the three story level. Four years ago, I worked on a management group to take a look at the animals that were flying over the wetlands area and across PCH.\nSpeaker 3: And on to the Long Beach Marina area. Many of those trees have been cut. 58 of the trees have been taken out in this particular community. So we don't have some of the birds that we once had. I realize I only have 30 seconds to make a difference, but you can make a difference as a member of\nSpeaker 3: this council.\nSpeaker 13: And look at it and see.\nSpeaker 3: That down the road. What you do tonight.\nSpeaker 13: In your decision makes a difference in our children's lives, in the community lives. And it's not all about money.\nSpeaker 3: It's about saving enough environment, space that it is functional for this community.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you for your time. Ask you to do so.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker bruce. Good evening, vice mayor and.\nSpeaker 4: Members of the council. I'm Jeff miller. I live in long beach. I urge you to reject Sea CIP as it is currently proposed. Why? Because it would allow new buildings to be too tall. Increased height above the currently allowed 35 feet would be detrimental to the city.\nSpeaker 4: Proposed changes could lead to our stretch of PCH looking like Lincoln Boulevard and Marina del Rey. Another concrete canyon. Increased traffic resulting from increased density would negatively affect city residents and workers. The traffic itself, of course, but also decreased air quality despite the claims by city staff.\nSpeaker 4: This plan is not supported by the majority of Long Beach residents. This false claim has been stated so often that maybe you believe it. The Sea Subcommittee was not representative of residents. The committee meetings did not provide for adequate public involvement and comment.\nSpeaker 4: Additional community meetings were not designed. For adequate public input. The wishes of the majority of the residents of the city are being ignored. The CCP should reflect the will of the residents of the city. These half a million people are your constituents, not a dozen commercial property owners and investors along a one mile stretch of PCH.\nSpeaker 4: Your allegiance belongs to the residents and businesses throughout the city who would be harmed by this plan. You do not owe allegiance to a dozen developers who would change the character of this vital area of the city. The current construction plan for the old Seaport Marina Hotel property shows that development and profit is possible within the 35\nSpeaker 4: foot height limit. I ask that you maintain this limit for the good of the city now and.\nSpeaker 9: Long into the future. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Hello. I'm Richard Roth. I live in the Long Beach and District three, and I can basically support what the previous speaker just said and the appellant as well. We have this thing has has just has to be smaller.\nSpeaker 4: And one thing that I'm not sure was brought up. If today Mexico City or the Mexico City area had a huge earthquake, if we had a and we're going to have a similar event here. And if you're in the area around, well, all of the third district, you're going to be trapped.\nSpeaker 4: So we have a serious safety issue that we're ignoring. And I don't think I need to say anymore. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your time. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Before you before you start my time. Can I tell you.\nSpeaker 11: That I've gotten so many texts from people who cannot hear, who are in the overflow room and they said there's no one to be found that can help fix their audio.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Well, I think that's.\nSpeaker 11: The right thing to do, given there's so many people.\nSpeaker 3: Interested in this.\nSpeaker 0: Issue. Right. This your city manager? Can we check that out? Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 11: So can we take.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. Let's start your time. Right.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you so much. So my name is Elizabeth LAMB. I'm executive director of the Low Street Wetlands Land Trust. Before I say anything else with my brief 2 minutes, I want to thank city staff and thank our council member for the ability to dialog with them and share with them our views.\nSpeaker 3: It means a lot to us.\nSpeaker 11: As you know, we are devoted to protecting and restoring flows through this wetlands. So it's a great community resource, not just for local residents, but for everyone who.\nSpeaker 3: Lives in Long Beach. Therefore, we need a plan for the Sea Superior that provides the right.\nSpeaker 11: Balance of conservation and development consistent with the community context and vision. With that in mind, why we understand that you.\nSpeaker 3: Feel pressure to conclude this.\nSpeaker 11: We do want to remind you that the general plan.\nSpeaker 3: Process provides a second opportunity to revisit, see an amended if warranted.\nSpeaker 11: So let me.\nSpeaker 3: Quickly summarize.\nSpeaker 11: The final few modifications that we.\nSpeaker 3: Urge you to include that we.\nSpeaker 11: Sent in our final comment letter. Factually, very few.\nSpeaker 2: Acres of the Sea Superior.\nSpeaker 3: Are in play here for redevelopment. Actually, less than the 85 acres that was first identified as areas of change because of the fact that second and PCH is moving forward, internal road surface parking.\nSpeaker 11: But even that small remaining part that remains will.\nSpeaker 3: Have a huge impact to the community.\nSpeaker 11: And the wetlands develop depending on how it's.\nSpeaker 3: Developed. So we support further density.\nSpeaker 11: Further reduced density in the form of an interim baseline density that could be revisited later.\nSpeaker 3: We support.\nSpeaker 11: 100,000 square feet of new commercial development, which would bring the total up to 2,000,191 476.\nSpeaker 3: Square feet.\nSpeaker 11: We support 1000 new units, dwelling units for a total of 5070 units and redevelopment of the existing hotel rooms. As my time winds out, I want to tell you that we've put all of these in a specific comment letter to you.\nSpeaker 11: And to really emphasize the point that we're not saying don't do anything. We're saying do something that's reasonable and balanced and protects an important resource.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 10: Good evening. Council Members.\nSpeaker 11: Michelle Black on behalf of.\nSpeaker 10: The La Cerritos Wetlands Land Trust. And again, the Land Trust really does appreciate the changes that have been made to see steps to improve the specific plan and add bird and wetlands friendly policies and mitigation. But the city's general plan is now underway, which was not the case when Seaside was initiated.\nSpeaker 10: There's now a strong argument that the sea SAP approval should wait until the general plan update is completed. So there's no question that the general plan is current and complete to provide a legally adequate basis for approval. Our letter laid out a path to approve seize up in advance of the general plan update.\nSpeaker 10: Now there are some parallel to approving a specific plan in the absence of a legally adequate general plan. And we see that as a really good reason to ensure that CCEP has included all feasible mitigation measures. If the city chooses to adopt CSF now before completion of the General Plan update, we recommend that you adopt a lower\nSpeaker 10: interim density as a as Elizabeth mentioned and proposed by the Land Trust, and that's detailed in our letter. And this is a baseline density that could be revisited, as Elizabeth said, and modified in the future. After hearing more public comment and after looking at the analysis that will be generated by the general plan update process, remember additional\nSpeaker 10: development in this environmentally sensitive and traffic constrained area at any density, interim baseline or reduced density will have significant impacts on the wetlands and the community. The mitigation for this must be very, very carefully worded so that it meets its goals of protecting community and environment.\nSpeaker 10: So this means that wetland buffers are actually buffers. There's no development.\nSpeaker 11: Or recreational activity.\nSpeaker 10: Within the buffers themselves. This means that open space is actually open space and not private patios in places the public doesn't know about. And this means that height limits are lower in this sensitive area to protect birds. The inclusion of excellent bird safe measures is laudable, but we're afraid that those gains could be eroded if height limits\nSpeaker 10: are high. And thank you very much. I'm here to answer any questions on my letter.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name's Linda Pemberton, and I'm from Belmont Heights. And. I'm here representing myself as just a neighbor, and I know that I'm in the camp of I would like to see this plan adopted with some change.\nSpeaker 3: And I think most of the people that I talked to are very concerned about the height and the density because of the traffic. And as you know, you're talking all over the city with people about the general plan right now.\nSpeaker 3: And there's a lot of people who are concerned about the same issues. So I just wanted to bring out bring to your attention that with the reduced plan, it actually represents about 22% of the housing needs that Scaggs is saying that the entire city needs.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that's a little high for an area that has going to put all of these almost 56 I mean, 2600 housing units in a little 86 acre space next to a wetlands. And where we have such terrible traffic, I think an increase of 43% in the traffic with probably 18 of our 21 intersections have difficulty\nSpeaker 3: now. So while I thank you for putting together this this plan, I would like to see the baseline density option with caps on it put into place so that we can move slowly into the future. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Yeah. Hi, I'm Marshall, Dostoevsky. I live in Ocean Boulevard and I'm on the steering committee of the Long Beach Area Peace Network. And I've actually come here for two reasons. One, to support the hotel workers in their fight for justice.\nSpeaker 0: But the other thing is, I am representing Lebanon, a Long Beach area peace network. And we're interested in peace and social justice. We're really against this whole plan. We think that it's the whole idea of Caesar was to preserve the wetlands.\nSpeaker 0: What this is going to do is isolate the wetlands. It's too big. The project. It blocks the wetlands. We're also concerned about the oil drilling. Why are we concerned about oil drilling?\nSpeaker 4: Because global warming.\nSpeaker 0: Or climate change is a real issue. And I think that Long Beach is so oil dependent that we are not really thinking about what's going on in the world. We know that climate change has caused part of the Syrian problem, a civil war.\nSpeaker 4: There.\nSpeaker 0: And so the social justice issue here is why do we want to pollute our environment and add to the climate change as a city? So I think we have a chance to to try to take care of this problem and to make this this project a much smaller and much more workable.\nSpeaker 0: Not seven story hotels and everybody's talked about that. The other thing is that I'm a little concerned about was that we kind of lost our right for public comment. We lost a minute. So everyone here is I don't know how many we got.\nSpeaker 0: We wrote 30, at least 30 minutes or maybe more. And for the next and hopefully for the next stage of their agendas, the discussion will not be cut off. So thank you very much. Thank you. Next week, a piece.\nSpeaker 4: The evening, we're going to see it. And members of the city council I name is Ward Johnson. I live at 436 Bellflower Boulevard and the Blue. The proposed strip mall that's at second. And PCH is yet another failed attempt by the property owner and another developer to put in another quick and dirty fix to get their money\nSpeaker 4: out so they can. They can. Which means it's a thing where they got in adequate parking and even the developer mentions that there's not enough parking. There are numerous other health food stores and gyms that people can access easier than going to this new site that's being proposed.\nSpeaker 4: The proposed com. This proposal completely fails to offer any solution to mitigate the heavy traffic congestion. That is a huge issue here and only going to get worse if this thing is built. What kind of message does a strip mall send send to people coming into our city as an entry point?\nSpeaker 4: How can it pass in a year when? These architectural renderings that are being offered show north no parking space and are no space between the buildings for the birds to fly through or people to see the ocean. So is there another proposal that needs to go down?\nSpeaker 4: So until they can come up with something?\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. And before we go to the next speaker real quick, I just want to make sure. Are there any folks I know if the fire chief is here that are outside for see SIP and if there are?\nSpeaker 0: If there are. I want them. I want them to bring them in. I'm not the face. The fire chief here. Where did he go for a sip. Thank you. So then we are going to cut off the speaker's list and we are going to the lady in the back.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. She is out. She will be. Unless there's anyone else receivership. Now's the time. Okay. Okay. So Mr. Barnaby, the last speaker for Ccep and he is going once we're done. See SIP. That is the line. Yes. Please continue.\nSpeaker 0: Hi, my name is Marcos. I live in one more district. I know it's not near dip, but it's still part of Long Beach. And I'm here to support to sip see dip c 72. Very confusing. I go to USC, I'm studying urban planning, master's second year.\nSpeaker 0: It's planning is such a difficult thing to understand specific plans in particular. So sorry, I don't I'm not good at public speaking, but it's difficult to understand specific plan. So I understand when the public confused and they think that an eight story hotel is going to come in like tomorrow.\nSpeaker 0: So I understand also trust the council and I trust the planning commission and I trust the city that you guys are going to. Build something that connects to the wetlands and not just build the store, its story building that's not going to, you know, connect.\nSpeaker 0: So I just want to say I support the project, not the project. I support the specific plan. And thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good afternoon, counsel. My name's Melinda Cotton. I live in Belmont. Sure. You've heard a lot about density and traffic and height. And the words 60 feet and 80 feet have been used for the five storied seven story buildings.\nSpeaker 3: However, I discovered going through the plan today on page 70 of the development standards, there is a notation that says along PCH, architectural features up to an additional ten feet may be approved by the Site Plan Review Committee.\nSpeaker 3: So we're talking about even taller buildings than we were earlier. We're also told we will gain amenities through this plan. Those have never been quantified. We don't know how much a developer will be required to donate. We don't know what this will mean in real terms.\nSpeaker 3: And most of us would probably agree that the amenities we have now offer fresh air and sky and trees and views of the mountains and wetlands are more important than where these are unknown amenities. And I think an important part of this is that the additional residences we're talking about are market rate.\nSpeaker 3: They are not a controlled in any fashion. So they're going to be affordable by the wealthy, by those who can use them for second homes. They will not be affordable for an average Cal State Long Beach graduate or the average worker or family, nor affordable for the low wage workers who desperately need housing.\nSpeaker 3: So we're being asked to take on more traffic congestion, more density, more competition for our existing struggling retailers. And they are struggling in Belmont Shore and we will lose the low scale structures and environment that now surround the wetlands.\nSpeaker 3: So I hope that you will rethink this and lower the height limits and try to help those who need help.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Hello. My name is Michael James. Kathy. I reside on 1814 Clark Avenue. I was born and raised in Long Beach, California, and I've been adopted into the tongue verification in Canoe Family. Given the name, Halbert means the Seeker.\nSpeaker 4: So I want to speak on behalf of the Native Peoples of Long Beach. Performer and I. I see that so much of California's wetlands have been eaten up by increased development. Just inch by inch, by inch, by inch.\nSpeaker 4: And I fear that I'm opposed to this to the rezoning of sea, because I just see a further development that is not good for our wetlands and also paving the way for more oil extraction and fracking on a dangerous earthquake fault.\nSpeaker 4: The Newport Beach and Inglewood fault line right there and the constructions there are already going under liquefaction where there's constant movement of the land and sinking. And there's just is too complicated. It's very dangerous. And I want to see an improvement in the environment.\nSpeaker 4: So I'll just stop there. And I thank you all for listening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor and City Council.\nSpeaker 4: I'm Robert Fox. I'm the executive director of the Council of Neighborhood Organizations. I'm opposed to this particular plan at the moment. The first reason is the outreach was inadequate, and that was because the database that you all had to use was not updated.\nSpeaker 4: We only recently got the current listing of neighborhood organizations to the city about seven months ago. So the process here was flawed. People didn't show up. You had maybe a little over 200 people in the community meetings. That can't be the judgment for this council, not 200 people.\nSpeaker 4: Besides which, I have a real problem that the the input from those meetings was not reflected in the staff's report. So I think we need it from now on to have an independent auditor like Laura Dowd do the counting and the metrics on any kind of an evaluation which happens at our our outreach meetings.\nSpeaker 4: I'm opposed to this also on a structural basis. We have not made any infrastructure improvement issues on the table at this point in time. And we really need to think about this. It isn't a liquefaction zone. We don't have adequate sewers for the extra development.\nSpeaker 4: Eight storeys high next to the wetlands seems absolutely insane to me. I mean, 80 feet I mean, 80 feet tall, I think she said. But I mean, it's sort of like blocks in the Sunshine Law in San Francisco.\nSpeaker 4: You can't build a building that blocks out all of your son. So I'm concerned here about the density. I know that parking is horrible and I know the traffic is disastrous going through Second Street, and I'd love to mitigate that.\nSpeaker 4: So I will support anything which mitigates things where the quality of life for the citizens of Long Beach is improved. But I don't think that we need. A rush to judgment here because we're just coming up on the land use element.\nSpeaker 4: And when that comes up, we can discuss this. Thank you very much for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: I have a.\nSpeaker 3: Point before my time starts.\nSpeaker 0: Next week, a.\nSpeaker 3: Piece for Christensen. But the point of order is we're talking to a particular agenda item one Blue Suzuki's appeal. There are several other agenda items under siege. Is there going to be public comment time regarding those?\nSpeaker 0: Well, there's one public comment period. Time for the city attorney continue for all items.\nSpeaker 3: So this is our only opportunity. This is.\nSpeaker 0: The crime.\nSpeaker 3: On the all of the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Items on the on the agenda items regarding C zip.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, correct. Okay. So now can I start my time, please? What's the point.\nSpeaker 0: Of your time is going continue. I will give you the time at the end.\nSpeaker 3: Go ahead. Thank you, Robert. I mean, Mayor. So so you should have received this from the Long Beach Area Peace Network. I'm not going to read it again. I might read the summary. What I will read, though, because Ms..\nSpeaker 3: Burdick made a point to say that the Veto Our Mineral.\nSpeaker 4: Partners project is not part of.\nSpeaker 3: This. I will read from the May 5th memo Anybody Own Memo stating that the specific Plan C CIP is designed to be consistent with the beach all mineral partners proposed restoration and consolidation project. She left out, of course, the word oil.\nSpeaker 3: This is an oil drilling plan embraced by a rezoning plan. There is no question about it. So I suggest that the elephants in the room, fracking earthquake pipeline breaks and sea rise, all of which the Coastal Commission wrote about and demanded that the Beach Oil Mineral Partners Project address should be at least in the back of your\nSpeaker 3: minds today. Now, what's in the front? It's Hispanic Heritage Day. We had some beautiful music. There's a history here. There's a heritage here. This room is filled with people from Hispanic heritage. What do they want? Sanctuary. Where do they want a safe place to work?\nSpeaker 3: Right. We all do. We want to be able to be safe in our employment. And this is this is my hope, peace and social justice, network speaking. We want safety for our workers. We want safety for our darker kids.\nSpeaker 3: We want safety for our wildlife. We want safety for the what remains of.\nSpeaker 4: Native.\nSpeaker 3: American culture in the wetlands. We say leave it in the ground. Leave the 200 million barrels of oil that are folded in to this plant in the ground and the culture and the ground and and get unfortunately, you know, what wildlife doesn't have either.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 3: All in the same boat.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you very much. Our last two speakers.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Mary Parcell. I'm here on behalf of El Dorado Audubon Local chapter of the National Audubon Society. This project is very complicated and Bob is included. When you read the sea tip, the sea sip this plan.\nSpeaker 3: Now. So it is very, very complicated. Our concerns have always been the wildlife, of course. Shopkeeper, road extension, the footprint of an extended shopkeeper road has a potential to impact existing neighboring wetlands, including jurisdictional wetlands, open space and biological input impacts of the project for analysis of the potential impacts to biological resources that would be created by\nSpeaker 3: the extension of Shopkeeper Road, including surveys for special status plants and animals have the potential to exist in the footprint of this roadway as proposed, so there could be cumulative and unintended problems with this. This is straight out of the California coastal conservancies concerns.\nSpeaker 3: We're concerned with birds and native plants. Redwing Road, winged blackbird, a particular species of the marsh, ran song sparrow, common yellow throat, American Kestrel Osprey, Northern Harrier Harrier White Tailed Kite Buildings Savannah Sparrow. What? Run out of my time before I can list all the birds that we love.\nSpeaker 3: And I was at an art event over the weekend with people from the fourth and fifth District. And person after person knows about the great blue herons that fly through the buildings. Not over seven stories. I think that's.\nSpeaker 3: You got to have some ways for the birds to get through. The great blue herons, the great egrets, the snowy egrets, the black crowned night herons, all of them, just individual people. And that's a representative our of our members that we value this.\nSpeaker 3: So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. My name is Michael Bond. I'm a senior principal with Studio 111. We're a group of practicing architects, landscape designers and urban designers with a focus on revitalizing the city. I want to share that we were retained by the Alamo Bay Partnership.\nSpeaker 4: We, as Cedar See support was being developed, created a design or a vision for the 90 acres that the Alamitos Bay Partnership owns. We actually took that on the road and shared it with a lot of the community.\nSpeaker 4: And we wanted to also thank Susie Price for her interest in understanding the perspective. We were looking at the site. We've heard lots of concerns tonight about traffic and housing, and housing will be significantly less in terms of affecting traffic than any other use proposed on the site.\nSpeaker 4: And I wanted to provide some context. Keep in mind, Stony Brook Villas on Bellflower Boulevard, which has 471 units, has all four exits on Bellflower, and I've never seen congestion there. Marina Pacifica has 570 units with only one exit point on Second Street and that I've never seen Congestion, Channel Point Apartments, Pathways and Bixby Village and the\nSpeaker 4: Villages on the Green Total 773 units. They all exit on Bixby Village Drive. And I've never seen congestion there. I've lived and I've lived in Council District three for ten years, shop, bike and walk in this area in these areas.\nSpeaker 4: I also want to mention Whalers Cove and the Belmont Shores Mobile Homes Estates totaling 395 units, both exiting on loins in the same location or approximate location. And there's no congestion there. Second Street has backups due to Caltrans controlling PCH.\nSpeaker 4: Caltrans is focused on moving traffic and moving it fast by either having local control or updating the traffic equipment and synchronizing with our city.\nSpeaker 0: We thank you very much.\nSpeaker 4: Deeply reduce the amount of traffic that exceeds.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 4: On the cross streets.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much. That concludes public comment and the public comment portion of the hearing. What we will do is or public comment is closed. We'll go back to the Council for deliberation and for moving forward on the hearing.\nSpeaker 0: So first up is Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I'm going to make a few comments and then we'll. There are multiple items associated with this particular hearing. So after hearing from my colleagues, I'd like to go into the specific items and motion those individually.\nSpeaker 11: But before I talk about some of the points that were raised during public comment, I do have a couple of questions for city staff. There were some mentions regarding the general plan and the timing of the general plan.\nSpeaker 11: And I know the low Cerritos Wetlands Land Trust has expressed some concerns about potential concerns. Between CCF and the General Plan. I've had an opportunity to speak with the City Attorney and Development Services staff about this, but if you could address that, I think that would be educational for everyone.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Council member. So over here at the staff table, I think we all agree with Ms.. BLOCK and the land trust that the general plan is an important document. That's why the city is investing considerable resources into updating that document.\nSpeaker 0: At the same time, we have a disagreement about whether that prohibits this evening's action. From a planning standpoint, the areas of change that we're talking about are and land use district seven, which is a mixed use portion of the general plan.\nSpeaker 0: The uses we're talking about this evening are mixed uses. While some aspects of the general plan have aged, we don't find it to be meeting the standard for being inconsistent. Additionally, from a technical standpoint, I might can jump in.\nSpeaker 0: As a charter city, we're giving given a certain amount of latitude that other cities that are general law cities are not given. So when we look at the sum of all the factors, there's no reason that we cannot proceed forward tonight.\nSpeaker 0: We do believe that the action in front of you is consistent with the existing adopted general plan. We also agree with the comment that it's important to update our general plan, and that's why we're hard at work doing just that and look forward to bringing that item to council in the coming months.\nSpeaker 11: Well, and I appreciate that. And later, when I make motions, I do intend to make a motion that's different than the staff's proposal in regards to the general plan. So I do want to hear from my colleagues, but I do believe having some assurance that there will be consistency and no conflict is important.\nSpeaker 11: And I want that to be part of the plan before we move forward. So I'll bring that motion, the specific language of my motion. There were some concerns regarding height and as the development services staff and I both know this, the email correspondence and the comments that have come back, some of them have lacked factual accuracy regarding\nSpeaker 11: the height issue. So can you please in regards to the hotel heights, Mr. Koonce, talk about what exactly the height limits will be and under what specific and narrow conditions a developer will be able to build a hotel at this location.\nSpeaker 11: And what sites?\nSpeaker 0: Sure. So there's as some of the speakers noted, there's a limited number of sites that are actually changing under this specific plan. And then the action in front of you, consistent with what the Planning Commission did, is a reduced intensity alternative.\nSpeaker 0: And the other change the Planning Commission did was they reduced height at the marketplace site. So for the marketplace site as well as the Golden Sail site, your height limit is five storeys. So for the other site, which is basically the Marina Pacifica shopping center as well as the properties on the other side, they're on the west\nSpeaker 0: side of PCH. So you've got the current Whole Foods location and that Regency Center and some adjacent property. On those limited properties, those two locations. If a hotel wanted to come in, they could, with the permission of the Planning Commission, reach a height of seven storeys on up to 15% on the of the site, and only if\nSpeaker 0: they included additional extraordinary public benefits beyond what is contained as a base requirement. So that could include a public pocket park that could include a sports or recreational facility that was open to the public. In addition to the hotel guests, it could include a performance venue, but it would have to be an additional public amenity and it\nSpeaker 0: would be limited to the 15% and are limited to those two sites that, in the view of the Planning Commission, was the appropriate compromise.\nSpeaker 11: So if I can interrupt you one moment, because I think you're moving into another thought. In addition, one of the other factors that could be considered by the Planning Commission in determining whether or not to allow an application for seven storeys is a provision requiring moderate income and workforce housing.\nSpeaker 11: Is that one of the options that's available for someone applying to have seven stories?\nSpeaker 0: That could be an additional consideration, but it is limited to buildings that within that building contain a hotel use. And to finish that thought, the reason was brought up by a couple speakers that this is within the coastal zone.\nSpeaker 0: And the coastal zone includes all kinds of provisions. And we tend to think about the ones related to wetlands protection and coastal access, but it also includes provisions related to visitor accommodating and visitors serving use of. We as a city have an obligation to provide some type of incentive for possible hotel users in this area.\nSpeaker 0: The incentive that was available to us is providing them a little bit more height on a very small portion of it to select sites. And that's what's in front of the city council at this time.\nSpeaker 11: So the seven stories we're talking about is limited to two sites and could only be 15% of a total project on those two limited sites.\nSpeaker 3: That's correct.\nSpeaker 11: And it could only occur with the approval of planning commission, assuming that there are some of the amenities that you just include included in your list that are part of that project.\nSpeaker 0: That is correct.\nSpeaker 11: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: We.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. I just want to a few things. This project also creates a wetlands mitigation fund, which in my experience is very unique in terms of development projects and proposals. Can you talk about that a little bit?\nSpeaker 0: Sure. So the most recurring common theme that we heard during the outreach process was that the wetlands are very important and we need to find a mechanism not only to not build on them, but to bring them back to do restoration work.\nSpeaker 0: And I think all the parties agreed that that's important, but that's also costly. So what we wanted to do was find a way to exact a fee, which in a compliant legal way on new development that would incrementally help pay for the restoration work.\nSpeaker 0: So we've got a number of different wetlands out there in the area. There's some that are under private ownership and they would not be eligible for the use of these funds. But we have other wetlands that some are under the city's jurisdiction and some are under the Los Rito Wetlands Authority, which you set on their jurisdiction.\nSpeaker 0: And the issue for both those wetlands is a lack of funding to do things like invasive species removal, to correct the tidal flow, to do introduction of correct plant species. So in order to fund that work, what will happen is we will conduct a Nexus study and we will enact this fee in our research.\nSpeaker 0: We will be unique, at least here in the in the city, in the of cities in California. But we're confident that it's an important part of this plan because it's what we heard from the public was important. And as we develop that fee, we'll be sitting down with wetlands authority and with wetland stakeholders to make sure that\nSpeaker 0: we have a proper plan for how those fees are going to be best utilized.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. And I will be making an amendment regarding that as well in terms of how we move forward with that fee. But I appreciate the explanation in terms of timing of future developments. You know, I think a lot of times we hear comments about the the the density that's going to happen and the impact that that's going\nSpeaker 11: to have on traffic. Can you shed some light on what the realistic timing of future development is going to be in this seascape area?\nSpeaker 0: Sure. So this plan looks out all the way to 2060, but it also looks at tomorrow. So if the city council were to take a positive action this evening, the next step is for this plan to find its way to the California Coastal Commission, and we expect that certification process to take about a year.\nSpeaker 0: So after that, there are properties that are less encumbered and might be subject to development in what we in the planning world consider the short term. So in the next five years, for example, there's some possibility that portions of the marketplace could be redeveloped.\nSpeaker 0: But there are other properties, such as the Marina Pacifica Shopping Center, that are encumbered by long term leases, including to a grocery store, which typically is a lease that cannot be broken. So that development is 20 years away.\nSpeaker 0: So what we're talking about is a plan that's going to suit our needs today, but also well into the future. And in terms of the amount of development that the folks will see in the next five years, it's not zero, but I would describe it as limited.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. So I want to start off by thanking staff, especially Christopher Coons, for his work on this project. I became involved in this project in 2014, actually, before I took office. And Ms.. Cantrell, I know you sent in an email out with some allegations about my my involvement in this case.\nSpeaker 11: And I'd be happy to share with you that I've been involved with this project since before resuming or commencing office, and worked with the city attorney and the PPC to make sure that I could get involved in this project and be actively involved in this project.\nSpeaker 11: Happy to share all those letters with you. But all of that to say that I have worked really closely with staff from the first day until today, and I can tell you that never before have I experienced a staff member who has been such an amazing community partner.\nSpeaker 11: And it's Christopher has met with everybody. I'm going to talk a little bit about the process in a moment. And the plan that is before you today is a much, much different plan than the plan that was initially proposed.\nSpeaker 11: And I'll talk a little bit about why that is. And that didn't come about in a vacuum. And it certainly wasn't something that was decided on at the Planning Commission meeting alone. The plan that's before you today come.\nSpeaker 11: As a result of many, many discussions that city staff has had with community partners. And I'm really grateful for their leadership. This process actually started in 2004 with the Study Group and the old plan, which I'm very grateful to.\nSpeaker 11: Jan Hall, who's here today, was passed in 1977 and has lasted decades and served us very well, and it's no longer sufficient to meet the vision and the values of the current time. And that was the decision that was made in 2004, way before any of us were were involved in the decision making for the plan.\nSpeaker 11: That's tonight. That's before us tonight. This process started out for us in 2014 as CDEP and it was changed to see CIP. And it is obviously a very significant specific plan for the city of Long Beach and and for the third district because it is where we housed the most precious and greatest opportunity for wetlands restoration and\nSpeaker 11: preservation and also economic development for the city. The plan being considered tonight was developed after three years of outreach, including 50 community meetings and countless one on one constituent meetings, not just with city staff, but with myself and my team.\nSpeaker 11: I cannot tell you how many times I've received telephone calls from people who are here tonight, some of whom actually went to the podium and said that they're opposing the plan, requesting a meeting with me the next day at the 11th hour, asking for my time, asking for me to meet with them repeatedly on the same issue\nSpeaker 11: . And it's it's it's unfortunate to me that despite the shaping of the plan, based on their input, to get us to the place where at tonight that they're still in opposition, I certainly had hoped that we would have been able to acknowledge the progress that was made in the plan as a result of their input.\nSpeaker 11: But as with all things I know, sometimes it's not. It's difficult to acknowledge the positive and much easier to highlight the negative. But in any event, staff's initial initial proposal on size up was 30% more density than it is now.\nSpeaker 11: And the rich and original recommendation they made was 5 to 7 stories, not 3 to 5 stories. Where we are today is as a result of the input that we received, and I'm very grateful for where we have landed.\nSpeaker 11: This proposal fixes shortcomings and encourages consistency in expectations. The proposed plan corrects the shortcomings of the original plan. Preservation of the wetlands was not as much of a priority in 1977 as it is today. And I say that because of the focus that we have had on wetlands preservation, conceptual design and restoration that's happened over the last\nSpeaker 11: five years, that has not happened in this city before. And in fact, again, some of the speakers tonight, Miss Cantrell, had talked about there being no development on the wetlands since CDEP was created in 1977. And that's absolutely not true.\nSpeaker 11: There has been development in the wetlands since 1977 that should have never happened on the wetlands. And this plan helps us restore that and make sure that doesn't happen. Under the old plan, residential and commercial developments on open wetlands were possible.\nSpeaker 11: And indeed, we have less open wetlands now than we would have had had we adopted a plan to preserve them. The current proposal allows those areas to be protected and limits development opportunities sites. A specific plan created for this area establishes requirements for anyone who seeks to develop in this area, and those requirements are based on the\nSpeaker 11: desires and preferences expressed by the public. And yes, it's true, 200 people attending a community meeting certainly does not reflect the population of 500,000 in the city of Long Beach, but 200 people attending a community meeting, hundreds of people attending 50 community meetings is very significant in a particular district.\nSpeaker 11: I have seen outreach unlike that anywhere else in the city that it takes. Having a specific plan removes the variability that we see with developers seeking variances and exemptions. Everything is set beforehand and developers have a reasonable expectations on what the community and the public want.\nSpeaker 11: I want to thank some of the developers and their representatives who are here today, because I will tell you originally when they proposed plans three years ago, I made it very clear to them that the plans that they were proposing would not be something that I would support.\nSpeaker 11: And although because of tonight's appeal, I was precluded from expressing a solid opinion on this case prior to tonight, I made it very clear that I would not support a 5 to 7 storey height limit. Or the density options that were provided in the original proposal, rather than looking at projects on a case by case basis which\nSpeaker 11: can be inconsistent and based on different owners are stronger lobbyists or other special interests. The characteristics of a particular project are difficult negotiations. Instead of all that varied variability, a specific plan sets all the requirements before anyone proposes a project and bases those requirements on the specific wishes of the community.\nSpeaker 11: This particular element that's being proposed tonight is consistent with the vision that was laid out in 2004 and again when this process started with our stakeholder committee in 2014. Based on the vision developed by the community, this plan is forward thinking and embraces what we have stated in the vision.\nSpeaker 11: Examples of these elements include view corridors, public open spaces, wetlands preservation, wetlands, buffers of 100 feet, native planting, bird safe building treatments which I know the Audubon Society reached out to me specifically and requested and we made sure was included and most importantly, limits development to existing developed areas, meaning our wetlands will not be built upon.\nSpeaker 11: Most importantly, this plan allows for the creation of a wetlands restoration and monitoring fund that every new development will have to pay into. Among the items expressed as priorities in the community vision, this plan will create a gateway into the city that is more reflective of the beauty and charm of this area and will provide a moderate\nSpeaker 11: amount of new housing as highlighted in the staff report, which is much needed for the entire city. And it will also enhance our shopping restaurants and other retail opportunities. The plan addresses height, in my opinion, responsibly and gradually, and I would have never approved the recommendation that was initially proposed by staff for 5 to 7 feet.\nSpeaker 11: From the beginning, I have expressed to city staff that I was looking for a lower height alternative. The reality that heights up to 12 stories were once considered for this area prior to my serving on this council. Continues to perplex me.\nSpeaker 11: I'm not even sure how such a proposal would have made it to the Council for a vote. It's unclear to me because I cannot see a situation where my community would have supported that. This is not an area where downtown level heights make any sense and they don't reflect the community.\nSpeaker 11: I'm very pleased that the Planning Commission recommendations and staff's recent proposal limiting the height to five storeys for almost all except two of the parcels of land. This height is reasonable and goes to great lengths to set up community benefits with art, park, open spaces and commitments to our wetlands in exchange for future developments to be allowed\nSpeaker 11: . Additionally, if properties commit to even greater public benefits and are one of only a few properties further from the wetlands, they could build up to 15% of their property to seven storeys only if a hotel is included on that property.\nSpeaker 11: This would require major commitments from developers and huge investments in public outdoor benefits. Residents have again and again said they want like parks.\nSpeaker 3: Art view.\nSpeaker 11: Corridors, wetlands support and many other things that we would need.\nSpeaker 3: We will we would do.\nSpeaker 11: If we had that opportunity for any additional development. Large buildings that are seven stories tall is not something I would support. It is not something the community supports, and it is not something that this project allows for. Limiting heights in this area is extremely important because of the existing low height and keeping the area consistent and not\nSpeaker 11: creating a heavy burden of new residences, but also in preservation of wildlife needs and bird flight paths. Height has been a significant consideration at every stage of this process, and it has been reduced and reduced again many times, and requiring major investment in public outdoor amenities and open space in exchange for any expanded height.\nSpeaker 11: There's been a great deal of concern regarding traffic at this intersection, and rightly so. This is an area of major concern. The current proposal addresses this concern. The recommendation by Planning Commission reduced density by 30%, which I fully support, and I commend them on that recommendation.\nSpeaker 11: This recommendation alone will reduce traffic impacts. Future development is also capped on a per acre basis based on peak vehicle trip generations. This is better, in my opinion, than a first come, first serve basis that might result in developments that are less thought out or not fully contemplated.\nSpeaker 11: More than 300 square feet of residential development has also been removed from the plan, further reducing maximum development and traffic connection of Shopkeeper Road to Studebaker Road is also part of this plan which will further reduce traffic pressures.\nSpeaker 11: Additional. We expect the plan will include many traffic design and engineering elements to alleviate traffic. These include breaking up super blocks to allow for access off of Second Street, adding multi-modal transportation options and infrastructure, and working with Caltrans to allow better city access to control controls over traffic signals at the intersection of Second and PCH.\nSpeaker 11: It is believed that changing the traffic signal timing alone can improve traffic flow by 5 to 7% from the current conditions. This is around the level when most motorists would start to see a difference in traffic flow. It's rare to get developers, property owners, environmentalists and residents together to collaborate on a single project.\nSpeaker 11: This project did that. It's also rare and frankly unheard of to have a final project that all of these entities would applaud together as a victory. And I don't believe that that will happen tonight. But to me, it is also a success because the public process led to a reasonable middle ground that does not lead to massive\nSpeaker 11: development tomorrow, but rather slow developments improving our community gradually over the next 40 years. This is not a max use of this area of land. It's a modest increase proposal which will allow redevelopment but do so in a way that is balanced and meets the needs of the communities along with preservation of the habitat.\nSpeaker 11: This plan includes provisions from every stakeholder and group and in my opinion, effectively embraces the vision we have set out to accomplish in 2014. I want to thank the people who came out to speak in favor and opposed to the proposal tonight.\nSpeaker 11: Your input is valuable and whether you said it at the podium or not, we spent a lot of time together and your opinions and thoughts are reflected in this proposal. You know that even though you didn't say it, many of you with whom I met repeatedly after work late evenings at your request, you know that what you\nSpeaker 11: asked for is in this proposal. I know it and you know it. You didn't say it at the podium, but that's okay. This is a great proposal, and I ask my colleagues to support it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Council council member Councilor Maria Ringo.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. And I, too, want to thank everyone who came out today. If nothing else, it's your ability to engage in civic engagement with the city of Long Beach and anywhere you go. It's a democratic process, and that's what it's all about.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm glad that you're here, and I'm glad that you shared your comments with us because that's how we get to work things out. The decisions behind all we hear are not always easy, and they haven't been. This one is one of those that is not easy.\nSpeaker 1: Some comments that were made that were inaccurate I have to address. Yes, I was. And I continue to be a member of the Coastal Commission and I did address the issue of the Belmont Pool and its height. That height is obviously a concern, and I know it will be a concern to the Coastal Mission Coastal Commission once\nSpeaker 1: it gets there. One of the things that I looked at immediately on this project was one of the heights that we're talking about and talking about five stories. So if if Chris can please answer by stories means what?\nSpeaker 1: What would be at the maximum height of a five story building?\nSpeaker 0: So a typical five story building could be in that 55 foot range. It could go up to 60 feet, which is four stories at ten feet each and a larger 20 foot bass story. So similar to the existing Marina Pacifica condos that are just across the waterway from a portion of our areas of change.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So currently as proposed, the height limitations would not be increased significantly other than it sounds intimidating that we have five storeys. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 0: That's correct. In staff's view, it's not significant. It certainly was an area of great discussion and the heights have been adjusted down throughout the process in response to that great discussion we had with the public.\nSpeaker 1: Earlier, the panel mentioned 80 feet. So I mean, we're nowhere near 80 feet. So we're I think we're we're in a good place. The other aspects of this plan that I was looking at is also in terms of those that are mainly concern to also the Coastal Commission.\nSpeaker 1: And the only reason I'm saying that is because included in this plan is a modification of the LCP. The local coastal plan, which will again go to the Coastal Commission, will actually will look at again, I had a unique opportunity here to have to bite at this apple in the sense of visiting and revisiting this project from\nSpeaker 1: two different points of view. And so what I'm trying to do is try to get a sense of where we can possibly land in a good place. This plan right here, from what I can see, addresses all of the issues that would be concerning me.\nSpeaker 1: And Councilmember Price has mentioned those. In fact, I have all of these bullet points and I could check them of a shoot as she was discussing them in terms of mitigating traffic. Also, one thing that was not mentioned, I was but it was it wasn't addressed in a very direct way.\nSpeaker 1: But Susie, the mere phrase it because remember Price and I both said on the wetlands lottery with wetlands authority and in that we also deal with some of the concerns that people have with the wetlands. One of the main things that also was brought up by the appellant was about the the size and the and the concerns\nSpeaker 1: of oil drilling there. Well, I can say that not many people know that the owner of those drills gave the city 100 acres of land to go towards wetlands, and it was donated to us and they only wanted to keep five acres of that.\nSpeaker 1: So we have an additional 100 acres of wetlands that we can restore. And the best part I like about it is that there's going to be some money going into a restoration fund that will help in that restoration process.\nSpeaker 1: So I think it's a wonderful opportunity for us to make developers responsible for their development by giving back. I see a lot of also here that there's there's a public benefit to all of this. There's a public benefit in providing additional access and providing bicycle lanes and providing those opportunities for people to come to Long Beach and\nSpeaker 1: enjoy all the resources and amenities that we have to offer here. So having said all that, I think that they can support this project. I know that Councilmember Price has some additional amendments that she would like to make.\nSpeaker 1: We discussed some of those. I think I can support those. But hopefully when we come down to the vote that we could get the support of our colleagues to endorse and support this project to go out and talk to customers.\nSpeaker 1: We're probably there'll be some additional changes coming because of, of course, commission rules and amendments and the and the Coastal Act that will come into play for that. So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to chime in with a couple of thoughts. So, one, I you know, I remember when this conversation was before the last council and we followed it and it you know, and it's good to see how far the conversation has come.\nSpeaker 0: It's clear to me that, you know, the local councilmember Councilman Price, has put a lot of time into engaging, understand this issue, saying pretty much anything that would need to be said on this. You know, Chris, if this is indicative of the work that we're to expect with the without plan and some of the work there, we're\nSpeaker 0: really excited about that. But there's one area that I do want to you know, it's a bit it's a burning question on my mind and a lot of people's minds. And I noticed that there was some some focus on, like bird migratory patterns and bird activity, correct?\nSpeaker 0: That's correct. Okay. So so maybe you can answer this question for me. Do Birds of a feather. Actually flock together. We're looking forward to finding out in our great spaces that we're going to create in this area. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your time on this. Thank you. Councilmember Pierce.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you for the laugh. Vice Mayor, I want to also echo Councilmember Price's comments. I sat on that side the last time the second PCH project was here and know very well that this is a very different project than was here before.\nSpeaker 2: And I want to say how much I appreciate all of those that have reached out to my office, which has been a small handful. And the list of comments that I have that have emailed in have all been in support as well.\nSpeaker 2: I know I've met with Mayor Bob and and a couple of other groups. And so, you know, I think that we've come a long way in talking about community benefit agreements, which wasn't a phrase that we even used before, that we've come a long way in trying to put together a process that is inclusive.\nSpeaker 2: And unfortunately, sometimes it's frustrating because it's hard to get everybody in. This is the story of tonight, right? Everybody to work together towards the same vision. And I do agree that this project does that. And I think that staff has worked really delicately in trying to move that process forward.\nSpeaker 2: I won't take up too much time. Besides saying that I know that the councilmember is working with you all and there'll be some changes at the end. I look forward to hearing those, but I'm really happy to see that we've taken a longer step and a slower process and that there's still opportunities in the future to even\nSpeaker 2: make this project more fitting for the neighborhoods on each piece. So I welcome that process. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I want to say that I've enjoyed being a part of this process. There have been meetings throughout the city. One of the meetings that I attended was so.\nSpeaker 3: Long ago that the council, as it is today, has different.\nSpeaker 2: Members on it. And I was on the council at that time. And so I appreciate the public input. I appreciate that meetings happened throughout the city, not just in the third district.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm glad to hear that.\nSpeaker 2: So many of the original comments were included in the plan. I know that.\nSpeaker 3: Often community members believe that their comments are not held. For the record, and I will only reinforce.\nSpeaker 2: What I've been discussing a lot in the community is your opportunity for comment. Every night when we sit down at the dais, we receive a packet of comments on any agenda item that anyone uses online. And that's a really thoughtful way to put your your comments into the record in addition to coming forward and speaking.\nSpeaker 2: And so I would just continue to encourage that because we read those. And as you can tell, we listen at those meetings and the changes have been made and so great.\nSpeaker 3: Work to our staff.\nSpeaker 2: This has been a long process. We really appreciate you and all the work that you've put in, great work to the community getting to this point. And I hope that when we see the progress in the direction that we're looking towards, that we see that as a win in the right direction because not everyone can get everything\nSpeaker 2: all the time. So congratulations to everyone who got something in this plan. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And Councilwoman Pryce.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. At this time, I'm going to make a series of motions and would ask for my colleagues support. First motion. It would be on the first. Would the clerk like to read that item or should I? Okay.\nSpeaker 11: So recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing.

        "source": "Speaker 2: I remember 19 report from city manager recommendation to receive report and provide direction to staff on the options, addressing bio technical and various other alternatives for the bluff, erosion and Enhancement. Phase two Project District three.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I'm going to turn this over to our city staff.\nSpeaker 5: Mr. Mayor, council members, this has been before the city council several times. This is a project that actually started in the year 2000. I'm going to give it to our assistant city manager, Tom Modica, to walk us through where we are now, what we were asked to do by the City Council and what recommendations are tonight to\nSpeaker 5: proceed to complete the Bluff Project.\nSpeaker 11: Mr. MODICA Thank you, Mr. City Manager and Mr. Mayor, members of the Council. Tonight we have a fairly detailed presentation about this project. As the manager mentioned, it does go back a long way. I want to provide a lot of history.\nSpeaker 11: I want to provide some context about what had happened in the last year or so. Some of you were on the council during that time and some were not. And tonight, we're asking you for some direction as well.\nSpeaker 11: We've done a tremendous amount of study on this on this issue. And tonight, we're asking for some direction. So to go back, getting the slides up here. Okay. So I'm project background. November 2000 is when this all started and Tetra Tech completed a master plan for development for our overall BLOCK Erosion Enhancement Project.\nSpeaker 11: So we went out to the community. We did targeted outreach, met with a number of groups. And the real purpose of that master plan was to identify a number of things. But failure was one of them. Erosion that was undermining some of our sidewalks and public access, public safety hazard from potential collapse of the bluff, dying and\nSpeaker 11: sparse vegetation, vegetation. And then also some of the seismic concerns that we have of the bluff and the possibility that a major seismic event would result in the collapse of our historic bluff. And so a number of geotechnical studies were done both in 2000 and then throughout a number of other years.\nSpeaker 11: 2000, 2000, three took a little bit of a hiatus as it was a master plan. But when it started to come to the funding options, we did additional study in 2009 and in 2010. And so there were a number of projects that were recommended in that master plan, some of which were engineered solutions, like what we're talking\nSpeaker 11: about in terms of stone owls and shard create. But others were not. There was the 12th place erosion improvements in 2007 and 2008. The fifth place and seventh place erosion improvements in 2010 and 2011. We had phase one of stone nails and sculpted shot crit in 2011.\nSpeaker 11: We also then had started phase two from 20th place to Redondo with sonar and sculpted short Crete in 2014. And then we also had the Bixby Park Bluff improvements, which is now a completed project and is getting pretty rave reviews from the community and from others.\nSpeaker 11: And so that one was part of that master plan as well. And so for phase one and phase two, phase one was approved by the City Council on November 16th, 2010, and that included so nailing and shot create on a specific part of the bluff.\nSpeaker 11: And that was completed in 2011. Phase two was was approved for construction by the Council on July 19, 2000, July nine, 2013, with a contract awarded to Drill TEC. And we really only are looking at those engineered options for the areas where our city engineers really set are.\nSpeaker 11: And that's a critical area for an engineered solution. It turned out to be only about 45% of the bluffs. So it's not the entire bluff phase. But that project not only dealt with seismic stability and bluff, erosion and and stabilization, but also included the replacement of the sidewalk railing, major landscaping and the full replacement of the irrigation\nSpeaker 11: system. So what you have here is a site map. You can see far to your right on that where it says phase one complete. That was the phase one that was done in 2011. And then the other three phases here that are part of phase two.\nSpeaker 11: And so on April 29th, 2014, the City Council voted to pause the project and request some additional information and directed staff to conduct an engineering analysis, which we did through a peer review. We brought on three different biotech or geotechnical firms to basically look at the assumptions that are our first geotechnical engineering firm made to determine had\nSpeaker 11: we made the right decision in choosing, shot, create and saw nails as the appropriate and engineering solution. And essentially that peer review did find that that was an appropriate solution. However, there was some other feasible bio technical alternatives for selling out areas that had not received shot create.\nSpeaker 11: And so on July 1st, 2014, the Council directed staff to review and evaluate those bio technical options and also to complete the park construction project. And so really focusing on those unfinished areas of the bluff and then continuing with the construction.\nSpeaker 11: So I'm pleased to provide an update on the construction. It's actually looking very nice out there. This project has taken a while, but we have seen tremendous improvement out in the park. 3700 new feet of sidewalk and historic railing have been fully installed in Bluff Park.\nSpeaker 11: That railing is galvanized steel guaranteed to last 25 years and is really an attractive feature out there along the entire walk. Now, for 3700 feet, we're going to have either existing or improved landscaping as we get a number of people who enjoy that that park.\nSpeaker 11: And the irrigation system has been completely replaced and receding. We'll fully to fully restore our bluff park is scheduled to begin very shortly. The irrigation system was in terrible condition, requiring constant repairs and due to line failures. We've installed more than 4000 feet of four inch main line and 8000 feet of three quarter inch to three inch\nSpeaker 11: lateral lines. And recycled water is will be used for irrigation in the park. So when you see the sprinklers on, please know that that's reclaimed recycled water. So here's a picture of our new sprinkler system functioning. And as you can see on the right, the grass is already starting to come back, will be doing additional seeding and\nSpeaker 11: trying to get even more to come back. But we are making good progress turning that back into a nice community asset. On the right you'll see that the concrete as directed by a council it was and we want to be pleased it wasn't stained.\nSpeaker 11: Some of it in some areas was either gray or it had a first coat. And so we've completed the standing of that. So that's beginning to look much more natural and what we're expecting for plant coverage, one that was clearly heard by staff when the council considered this back in April, was that there was concern that there\nSpeaker 11: wasn't going to be plant coverage when when we talked about that project, there really wasn't much established or what had established that died. So we went out to the community and talked with the community about what that plant coverage should be.\nSpeaker 11: We are designing this project for up to 75% plant coverage and hopefully even more than that, if we can get up to 100%, we'd love to certainly do that. The current plan is to use native plants. non-Natives actually give you a little bit more coverage, but they don't add any ecological value.\nSpeaker 11: And the public input that we heard was to go with native native plants and then use an adaptive management strategy to try to maximize plant success. I'm happy to report the majority of the planning on the bluff has been completed and the plants are thriving and that we went through a process already to enhance our landscaping plan\nSpeaker 11: to be more drought tolerant, colorful plants, and then create that increase that plant coverage area. So looking at some of the plants, you know, this is a sample of the selection we have Island Morning Glory shall we? Island Snapdragon Caribbean Island Mallow on the bottom beach Evening Primrose Sea Pink and Beach Strawberry.\nSpeaker 11: As you can see in the next one on the top of the of the entire bluff, we have an opportunity to do landscaping there. And the point of that landscaping is also to have it flow over and to help cover the shock route from the top.\nSpeaker 11: And we have two other areas for planting, one in the middle of the bluff and one at the toe of the bluff. But here you see a number of plants big evening, primrose sea, pink beach, strawberry blue eyed grass, coastal poppy and maritime.\nSpeaker 11: Santos And in the next slide, you'll see the planter pockets. This is all of phase two has new planter pockets designed to have plants actually in the shot create itself. We've seen this work in other areas very well.\nSpeaker 11: If there is appropriate, if it's done appropriately. And so clockwise from upper left corner we have showy island snapdragons and Katherine's lay splatter pod and island. Morning Morning Glory. So I want to give an example of what that would look like.\nSpeaker 11: This is Island Morning Glory in a different setting. But the point of of using a landscape architect and going out to the community is to pick a palette that will actually work and establish and also provide a lot of coverage like what you see here.\nSpeaker 11: So looking at the total look design, these are the plants that are going to be at the toe. You'll see we've done some planting already. And the idea is that these are going to grow over time to really help cover the foot of the bluff or the toe of the bluff.\nSpeaker 11: So these are lemon lemonade, Berry, Catalina Island Marrow and Holly Leaf cherry. So I want to give some examples of what Shark Creek can look like and when it's during constructed and after construction. You'll see in this example, you'll see on the left the during construction and after construction.\nSpeaker 11: In this example, it's fully covered. Going to the next slide. This is an example from Dana Point where it originally looked very bare. And as you can see with the native planting on the right, we've got very full coverage.\nSpeaker 11: It's very actually difficult to see that Chuck Reed is even there in that example. And on the next page, this is from Agoura Hills, you'll see construction on this on the left. And then after construction, again, very difficult blends in.\nSpeaker 11: And that's really the point is to use it as stabilization, but also have it blend in.\nSpeaker 5: So talking about the.\nSpeaker 11: Current conditions, you'll see we've begun plantings. We've got plantings in the. Planter pockets at the toe and and at the top.\nSpeaker 5: And so the really.\nSpeaker 11: Who were coming to ask you tonight that's the update to where we are with the project. We do want some additional direction on the in the two areas to be completed. So that's phase two, area one and phase two, area two.\nSpeaker 11: And you'll see them on that slide. And so what we're asking for is we've brought you four different options as we've gone through our study process. And I'll talk a little bit about that. And we're seeking some direction options before the council include two one complete the original project.\nSpeaker 11: We looked at two bio technical options. One is steel mesh and the other is cellular confinement. And then we looked at a major regrading alternative as well. So going through each option. Option one complete the original project we had three independent geotechnical engineers confirm that soil nails and shot create are an appropriate solution for the project they\nSpeaker 11: are used elsewhere. What's important to note is that these bluffs in the areas we chose are unique in that they are not a gradual slope. They're not 2.5 or 3 to 1. They are about half a foot to one.\nSpeaker 11: So what that means is for every half foot avert of horizontal, you're dropping a foot in vertical. And so that's a very steep slope and that really is recommended for an engineered solution. Shot Create is also a very cost effective option.\nSpeaker 11: It has at least a 75 year effective life lifespan and requires pretty minimal annual maintenance. And the whole point is that the vegetation will cover the concrete as it grows and fully establishes itself and expected to achieve that and no greater bluff coverage than in other areas.\nSpeaker 11: And so one thing I'd like to show is a rendering and this is what we're expecting Shark Creek to look like afterward. This is this is the designs and this is the goal with the 75% coverage and more, if we can get it.\nSpeaker 11: So we also looked at bio technical options. The June 23rd peer review report indicated that some bio technical techniques have been used. They are mostly used in inland areas rather than in coastal areas, but they can be adapted to coastal areas and they can also tie into the soil and also provide that structural solution that you need\nSpeaker 11: , but also may have some esthetic qualities as well. And so the bio technical techniques can be applied to the site, especially in areas that are that ratio of 1 to 1 or flatter. And so we went through a bio technical review process.\nSpeaker 11: We researched those erosion control methods applied throughout California. We interviewed experts with knowledge of those bio technical methods and experience in implementing them, and also brought on some consulting expertize in that area as well. So we looked at a number of different criteria.\nSpeaker 11: We looked at having, you know, the durability and seismic stability. We looked at erosion control, we looked at vegetation and planting quality, including the irrigation construction and maintenance costs, the implementation time and the regulatory permit requirements. And as we went through that selection process, a number of bio technical methods were screened out because they didn't meet some\nSpeaker 11: of those criteria. And so with bio technical option one, what that would be was a high tensile steel wire mesh that would be layered down and anchored to the soil an ounce. The slope would be hydro seeded with grasses and flowers and cut outs would be made in the mesh to allow for small shrubs to be planted\nSpeaker 11: . We expect that to be about a 15 year effective lifespan, but requires a lot of maintenance to keep it up. It has about an inch of topsoil on it, and so that topsoil tends to move around and the plants can't really root as well as in other models.\nSpeaker 11: And so we do expect there to be a plant failure rate that will be somewhat high and you'll have to get out there and do significant annual maintenance to replace those plants. This is what it will look like.\nSpeaker 11: You'll see from the side, you'll see the soil nails, you'll see the taco mesh that's on top of it. It's not a regraded option, if you'll see, it has that fairly steep slope and then you'll have large shrubs and medium to low shrubs at the at the toe.\nSpeaker 11: On the next slide, you'll see what it looks. Up, up, close. This is the technology. This is the telco mesh. And then what did it look like? This is a rendering of what will look like during construction. And then the next slide will be what it looks like after plant establishment and construction.\nSpeaker 11: And you'll notice on the lower left hand side, you can actually see that there's some of the tech mesh. That wire mesh is still visible even when it's constructed because it only has an inch of topsoil. It's expected to slip off in some areas.\nSpeaker 11: So you will see some of that a mesh under bio technical option one. And then this is a final example of what it could look like in a different area. This is a bio technical option that's used along a highway.\nSpeaker 11: So biotech me option two is one that we're soil would be imported to create a more uniform slope of 1.4 to 1. We don't expect that would impact the park or the beach. We would have steel mesh laid down very similar to option one.\nSpeaker 11: And biodegradable or synthetic vegetative cells would be placed on top and anchored to the mesh. And then that gets filled with about 4 to 8 inches of soil. So there would definitely be a lot more soil for plants to take hold too.\nSpeaker 11: And with that, you can get a wide variety and larger plants to be planted. We expect that to have a longer life, about a 25 year effective lifespan and not as much maintenance because the soil is going to hold a little bit better to the slope.\nSpeaker 11: You'll see in the cross-section that it is more of a uniform slope. It still has the soil. Now there is some soil fill that has to be done, but it is a more uniform uniform slope. On bio technical option two This is what it look like during construction.\nSpeaker 11: You can see the mesh is laid down and then it's filled with that 4 to 8 inches of soil. And then that's what it will look like after construction. That's an artist's rendering of what we expect it could look like once it's fully constructed.\nSpeaker 11: And the plants that established construction method, this is the wire mesh and then the the netting up on top that that covers it. And then this is just an example of of what it looks like in a different area.\nSpeaker 11: We're not we're not recommending this for our area. Obviously, this wouldn't be a suitable vegetative area on our bluffs. But it is an example of what what option two is look like in another area. So we were asked as we went out in this community process to really look at a different option, a regrading alternative.\nSpeaker 11: It is something that we had looked at previously. We had looked at that in 2000. We're asked to provide a little bit more information and take a look. And so we did that as a part of this review.\nSpeaker 11: The current slope conditions really are too steep to have just a a planting option without some sort of engineering solution. We've seen some other bluffs. Redondo Beach, for example, has a two and a half foot to one slope.\nSpeaker 11: That's a very gradual slope are our bluffs in some areas are about half a foot or 0.6 to 1. So a very different environment. And so in order to create this kind of regrading alternative, we'd have to import soil and compacted and create a very uniform 2 to 1 slope that wouldn't coat encroach either toe feet onto\nSpeaker 11: the beach or 20 feet into Bluff Park or a combination thereof. And that really is the minimum necessary without having an engineered stabilization solution. So some of the impacts of that is that you would have a staircase at 20th place.\nSpeaker 11: You're going to have to reconstruct that stair staircase in order to more conform to the slope of the bluff. You would still have to have concrete. Even with that regrading option, you would have to have a retaining wall, you'd have to have additional concrete or shot create on the sides.\nSpeaker 11: Essentially, you're going to have a very steep slope and you're going to have a gradual slope that comes out to the beach and then returns back over. And so there is opportunities for that soil to slough off on the sides.\nSpeaker 11: And so that needs to be engineered, otherwise your solution won't work. So you're either going to have to have a drainage trench, a concrete shot, create. There's there's a number of other options, but they'll have to be an engineered solution on the sides.\nSpeaker 11: You do get a wide variety of larger plants. It's it's a more it's a natural environment so that you can plant on it and you have additional soil. There is a high risk of trespassing, though, without an additional fence.\nSpeaker 11: And what we've seen in Redondo Beach, as you can see on the next page, is they do have that two and a half slope to one. And that's what it looks like in Redondo Beach. But you can see there is a a fence that is erected in the middle so that people stay off the bluff.\nSpeaker 11: And that's a current problem that we have as people tend to traverse our bluff and cause more erosion, the impacts of that regrading. You would have to import a bunch of soil and it would require approximately 2100 truck trips in order to bring in that amount of soil to achieve that solution just in those two areas.\nSpeaker 11: We talked about that construction of a wall or trench. So you you're going to to mitigate the horizontal erosion. You're definitely still going to have some some concrete on the beach. And depending on the exact solution, you're going to have to go back to local coastal development permit or an amendment to the local coastal plan.\nSpeaker 11: So this is an idea that we looked at in 2000 and and after looking at it again today, you know, we we did want to pay some attention to it. We wanted to look at it. But it is not one that staff would recommend.\nSpeaker 11: Wrapping up, I want to talk a little bit about the cost estimates and the fiscal impact. There are a wide variety of cost estimates for these different options. The completion of the original project is the most cost effective at $1.3 million for both areas.\nSpeaker 11: The bio technical options range for 4.3 million. For a bio technical option 1 to 7.75 million for bio technical option two. And then the regrading option is expected to cost 5.4 million. And these are in addition to what we currently have budgeted, we currently have a $5.8 million project budgeted for the bluff.\nSpeaker 11: That budget is essentially exhausted and this would be on top. So all four of these options are going to require additional tidelands funds or general funds in order to to cost to provide those solutions. Each one of those has a maintenance estimate associated with it.\nSpeaker 11: Then the completion of the original project was shot. Create is the lowest maintenance option in about 11,000. The bio technical option one is the most expensive at 26,000, and then bio technical option two for cellular confinement and regrading or both estimated about 19,000.\nSpeaker 11: So I want to talk a little bit about the fiscal impact. As of today, oil is today was selling for about $50 a barrel. That's very different than where we were two or three months ago when oil was at $100 a barrel.\nSpeaker 11: As you know, staff will be coming back to you by the end of the year as we promise to provide additional information on oil, to look at a longer range plan. Our capital plan, our five year capital plan was based on oil hitting a benchmark of $100.\nSpeaker 11: And so if we're not at that benchmark, we're going to have to reprioritize and look at what funds are available. So due to the anticipated funding shortfall for any of these solutions, we are going to need additional funds appropriated from either existing tidelands projects or if.\nSpeaker 11: We're looking at a very expensive project. There's going to, you know, the possibility of general fund because the Tidelands funds are already currently obligated. There's no additional funds that could be programed without impacting another project. We we would say that this project would take priority over other projects in the Tidelands because it's an unfinished construction project.\nSpeaker 11: We're in the middle of construction and and we need to complete those two areas in order to complete the project. And so we think this is something the Council will need to consider when evaluating the potential options. And so the last two slides here, timing considerations.\nSpeaker 11: Area one has already experienced some noticeable erosion after recent storms. So as I mentioned, it is important for us to get directions that we can move forward with a solution. They do have different time estimates. The completion of the original project is the quickest it can complete within within 2015.\nSpeaker 11: So next year we can we have a contractor on board. We are we just need to find the additional funds process, a contract amendment, and they can get started with the work by our technical options. One and two we expect would be done by 2016.\nSpeaker 11: They would require an extension of a current permit and then the ability to engineer and design and go out to bid for those. And the regrading alternative will take the longest. We expect that not to be able to be complete until 2018, potentially, as you go through the a pretty elaborate coastal development permit process.\nSpeaker 11: So on our last slide here, the four options for you to consider completion of the original project bio technical option, steel mesh power, technical option, cellular confinement and the regrading as you mentioned in our staff report, after spending a lot of time on this and listening to the community and and looking at all the engineering reports, we\nSpeaker 11: are recommending completion of the original project. We feel that's the most cost effective option as it has the lowest capital cost. We believe it offers the most protection up to 75 years of protection. It is one of the fastest to implement and we know the neighborhood is very interested in getting this project completed and it can be\nSpeaker 11: completed in 2015. It has the lowest maintenance cost at 11,000, provides the seismic stability. It importantly will match the other areas. We do have short create in other areas and that will match that other area. And we hear very loudly and clearly that there needs to be attention paid to making it look better than what it is\nSpeaker 11: today. And we're committed to doing that. If the Council chooses to move forward with that, we're going to pay a lot of attention to making sure the plants establish and cover and eventually well blend in. And so with that that end staff's report, and we are available to answer questions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 3: You. I want to thank the Bluff Park residents who are here. And I have a presentation that I've prepared as well. But I would like to hear from public public comment before I do my presentation. But in advance of that, I want to thank Tom and Eric and Andrew for your work on this.\nSpeaker 3: The city manager's office has been extremely diligent in following up and providing me with the information that I needed and specifically staff. Really. Reached out to the community at my request with specific community members who wanted to have an opportunity to meet one on one.\nSpeaker 3: And I want to thank you for that. That was a special request that you honored for me. And I think hopefully it meant something to the folks you met with and and that even though you're not recommending what they wanted, that they appreciate the time.\nSpeaker 3: So with that, I'd like to hear from the public before expressing my my thoughts on this issue.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Should we do public comment? If you want to comment, please come forward and line up on the podium. 3 minutes. Please say your name for the record. And please first. First speaker.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening. My name is Jim Corbett.\nSpeaker 11: I live in Belmont.\nSpeaker 5: Shore and we have a wonderful resource. And having a free newspaper delivered every Thursday that we get to see what is going on in our city. So last Thursday afternoon went up and I don't live near the bluff.\nSpeaker 5: I drove up and down ocean and one of the things that I noticed driving up Ocean is that you actually can't see the bluff, so you have to drive down Junipero, get out of your card, walk along and actually take a look.\nSpeaker 5: So it was really good seeing the presentation from the vantage point of the bike path in our future pedestrian path. One of the things that I notice is what has been completed looks nice and I can actually envision, as Tom presented, how the growth of the plants are going to drape over and we're going to see something\nSpeaker 5: really nice. And then you look as you stand in the Middle East Sea, right, is what's going to be completed on the left that you can see the Shot Creek not completed. And that is what was presented in the paper, in the ad.\nSpeaker 5: And it's pretty ugly. And then on the extreme left at the museum, you can see dirt. So somewhere in the middle is I see what is going to be projected. So I would like to move the council to complete the original project because I think that is the most affordable and it's going to be the most time\nSpeaker 5: effective as far as getting it completed. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 5: My name is Joe Garver. I live in Belmont Heights and I work on coastal zone management issues. I've worked with the legislative staff and committees on policy, and I more often work with community groups and non nongovernmental organizations on permitting and enforcement issues.\nSpeaker 5: I wanted to add a little bit to Tom's history presentation and make some comment about the cost estimates. But first, let me make a couple of observations. Kind of the inconvenient truth. Chocolate is prohibited on coastal bluffs like this, and it's prohibited for a good reason.\nSpeaker 5: That concrete cover prohibits native habitation and it prohibits coastal processes. And those those are important policy considers and considerations and why the prohibition on coastal and coastal armoring was included in the Coastal Act. And I'll make this observation that your local coastal plan recommends regrading and revegetation not only for all your coastal bluffs, but specifically for that\nSpeaker 5: area of the bluffs. I'll also mention that the progressive engineers, the new trend in engineering is using ecosystem services. An example may be in the Long Beach or near along Los Angeles River. They are tearing out concrete out of the river so that they can use flood plains for natural flood control, create habitat to, you know, quality\nSpeaker 5: of life improvement in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and get the same flood control that they get with concrete. This is the way things are going now. Don't get me out of there. So get to the history book. Listening to the community outreach, which I appreciate, and the level of community support for revegetation.\nSpeaker 5: It was only when the staff came back at the 11th hour and told the community that somebody at the Coastal Commission had told somebody of city staff that encroaching on the beach or regrade the slope was prohibited. This is ironic, I agree.\nSpeaker 5: It is prohibited regrading and encroaching on the beaches clearly allowed. And now we see that. Yeah, you'll have to go get a permanent like in the staff report, but it's not prohibited. So this was a huge mistake. It led to a comedy of errors.\nSpeaker 5: This error was repeated in the peer review report. The experts were told not to consider regrading because it was prohibited. But this is the best and fastest solution and.\nSpeaker 2: In the.\nSpeaker 5: Expense report and I'm running out of time, but there's a lot of overestimation to the expense report and this can be resolved in this project. Woodchipper, if you follow the pattern of what they did in Redondo Beach and solicit the help of of NGOs and experts on these projects and get plants and materials that you can get\nSpeaker 5: a discount from people that are experienced in this stuff. The budget in Redondo is a fraction of what we're talking about here.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks, Michael, please.\nSpeaker 2: Hi. My name is Anne Dulcie and I was invited to speak about my experiences at the Beach Bluffs Restoration Project in Redondo Beach. I did go on a Cal State Long Beach graduate and I lived in Long Beach, in fact, on Coronado Street, north of Anaheim Street, way back when.\nSpeaker 2: And I got a degree in marine biology and I'm a marine biologist, actually married to a geologist who.\nSpeaker 4: Got his degree at Long Beach State and works for Signal Hill. But I'm a resident of.\nSpeaker 2: Redondo Beach now, and I am passionate about natural systems beyond the ocean. And that led me to get involved in the Beach Plus Restoration Project, where I served as co-chair.\nSpeaker 4: And there we assembled a group of agencies.\nSpeaker 2: Cities, county officials, non-profits and also the local citizens. And we assembled a plan. Actually, what we did is we managed to get grants. We had no tidelands money. I mean, your budget is just astounding to me. Kind of makes me drool.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, but we we used about under $100,000 for our project, and we restored the land. We didn't do any amount of vacation. And there are many sections in that area that are very steep. It's flat on top, relatively flat on the bottom, and connected by a very, very steep area.\nSpeaker 2: And yes, indeed, that fence goes through. There's big sections in between where you can access the beach and there are some issues.\nSpeaker 4: So we've tried to work the plant, but what we did is we utilize.\nSpeaker 2: Local native plants to the coastal beach area, not not from inland coastal sage scrub, but the dune plant. And a lot of these plants have deep roots. The annuals tend not to be, but their perennials are deep rooted.\nSpeaker 4: They root feed.\nSpeaker 2: Yards into the soil. So you don't need to bring in any additional.\nSpeaker 4: Fertilizer or.\nSpeaker 2: Soil on top. An inch or two is not going to do diddly squat. These plants are designed to live in the harsh conditions of the sandy areas and they handle the salt. Salt bush is an excellent plant with a deep rooting roots, and it grows very well in this bluff, steep bluff situation.\nSpeaker 2: And in this area in the summer time, they go dormant. Education is required. We have set up signage to that effect. These plants, as any plants need to be watered for a good year on a regular basis until they become established.\nSpeaker 2: And once they're established, they do quite well during a really bad drought like we've had of late. You may want to augment water with them. Our biggest issue with non-natives and that needs to be addressed on an ongoing basis.\nSpeaker 2: And we used a nonprofit, LA Conservation Corps to help with that project. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. City Council Riba Birmingham. I live on the Bluff First Street, so as a member of the CERT team, I'm very concerned about safety. I know that we're overdue for the big earthquake and I do not want my house to end up on the beach.\nSpeaker 4: I think that the current plan is fine. I think we're well underway way and to stop at this point and do something that's completely different when this one is completely acceptable and seems to be the least impactful to the the Long Beach family budget is the way to go.\nSpeaker 4: So I would really urge the City Council to look at the work that was done by the staff. I'm glad that the staff has heard people's comments about the native plants and the woman that just spoke had really good points.\nSpeaker 4: It can be pretty, it can be safe and it can be affordable. So I would urge the court to please the court, the council, stay the course. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Riva. That's great. The next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And City.\nSpeaker 3: Council. My name is Sonya Coffey and I'm a.\nSpeaker 4: Resident of the fourth District.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm here tonight representing the Surfrider Foundation.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a newly appointed vice chair of the Long Beach chapter. And the chapter as a group here in the city does not support the use of additional short creek for the remaining phases of this project. We do appreciate the stats presentation and it was helpful to see the imaging of what the project could look like.\nSpeaker 4: But we do have some concerns, especially considering the first phase of the project and how the plantings and the irrigation failed in that in that process. And we would be worried with having an additional, additional expanse of concrete here in the city right on our oceanfront, that we would see a similar similar happening, not by any intention\nSpeaker 4: of staff or the city maintenance, but it is a concern because the short creek is not anything that promotes or supports a natural habitat. This organization here, we're dedicated to protecting our beaches and the enjoyment of the beaches and ocean for all.\nSpeaker 4: And so we would support something that really is more native and more natural. Definitely understanding that there are seismic concerns with the project there, definitely understanding that there are significant costs associated with the bio technical alternatives that were presented.\nSpeaker 4: We would ask the City Council considering those to rebuild the project if possible, since the current contractor does not want to work with the Biotechnol alternatives to rebid that project and see if we can get something more cost competitive.\nSpeaker 4: Some of the other speakers here presented other options of gaining funding for this projects grant funding the help of different nonprofit groups. Surfrider is here standing, willing and able to help in any way that we can promote a project that is more sustainable to the community as a whole.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Hi. My name is Roger Trickey. I come here as an industry.\nSpeaker 5: Professional in construction and also a resident of Bluff Park. I live at 44 Paloma. Right. And have a view of the park and the construction project from the front of my home. We've been living with this for over a year.\nSpeaker 5: It's really very disturbing to me that we stopped the project. When I heard it was happening and saw the plans for doing it. I was very pleased. I thought it was something that was long overdue. Having walked the park every evening prior to this last year, you know, it was just it was disturbing to me to see\nSpeaker 5: the disrepair and, you know, one of the most wonderful parks in the whole city really just, you know, deteriorating. And it needed that slope stabilization to really fix it. And I was extremely happy to see that happening. I was very disappointed that the council voted to halt the project and even more disturbed here recently to find out\nSpeaker 5: that we have really withered away a tremendous amount of money, you know, waiting to get a solution out there. It disturbs me even further to think that would we wait even longer and spend more money? It. I also want to speak to the nature of a bluff.\nSpeaker 5: That bluff stands vertical. Because of the nature of it, it is weakly cemented sands. It's basically weak concrete. We're making it stronger so that it doesn't erode it. Sustainability. I practice that in my own profession. I am a lead LEED accredited professional.\nSpeaker 5: We have a practice in our construction group that that is very sustainable and I have a good mind to that. And natural solutions come with what nature provides. Nature provided us with a cemented slope there, and I want to reinforce that.\nSpeaker 5: The other thing that's kind of disturbing to me is all of these other solutions. Actually, one of them, I believe, does maintain the the vertical nature of the bluff that's there. But the other to the second by our technical and the regrading really destroy the nature of the bluff.\nSpeaker 5: I mean that that is truly the. Historic thing that we have out there. It really wouldn't be a bluff if we start changing the grade of it. So I really strongly urge you to put this project back on track, get it finished as soon as possible.\nSpeaker 5: And we're going to be a lot happier. And by the way, great job, staff. The presentation tonight was beautiful. Wonderful job. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thanks, Speaker.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor. City Council. My name is Kelly Hyman.\nSpeaker 3: My husband and I are fairly new residents to Long Beach. We live in Bluff Park on Ocean directly across from this project.\nSpeaker 4: Before we moved.\nSpeaker 3: In or even made.\nSpeaker 4: An offer in our house, I saw.\nSpeaker 3: The signs for the Bluff Erosion.\nSpeaker 4: Project. I did my due diligence, read it all thoroughly, and my husband and I were in full support. I think somebody mentioned seismically. It's great that we're not going to fall off. And so we were thoroughly supportive of it, but very disappointed to see the project halted.\nSpeaker 3: This is not something I like to do.\nSpeaker 4: Come and speak in front of people in public, but.\nSpeaker 3: I feel very strongly about option one. Let's continue. Let's get it.\nSpeaker 4: Back on track.\nSpeaker 3: We've been patient because we knew that the project was the right thing for the bluff. And so we've endured, you know, the.\nSpeaker 4: Dust, the just the construction noise. I mean, the dust is beyond.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, if anybody lives on ocean, you know what I'm talking about.\nSpeaker 4: So we are in full support of moving forward with option one.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Next speaker. You're welcome to Long Beach. Glad you moved here.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening.\nSpeaker 8: My name is Isaac Waxhaw. And in front of you, you have a seven page packet. And if, uh. If you don't mind, I'd like to go to page five, please. That's at the base of the Junipero ramp down to the beach.\nSpeaker 8: And this is a footpath that would be devastating. Absolutely devastating to any graded bluff. This is human nature. They love to take shortcuts. And this is this is an example of it. The proposed bio technical area one is only steps away from this.\nSpeaker 8: If we don't learn from this, we're going to do it again. The city has been struggling with footpaths like this forever, for decades. There are big signs like this throughout the bluff and people just ignore it.\nSpeaker 5: As you could see, they're walking.\nSpeaker 8: Right next to the sign. And again, it's human nature. We can't stop it. I believe that the foot tracks are more devastating than rain or wind. It's going to destroy and probably have destroyed the bluff a lot faster than nature did.\nSpeaker 5: And so when you vote.\nSpeaker 8: Tonight, I urge you to have this page open in front of you because it may come back. Some of the signs were taken off when when the Shark Week came up. And I hate to see these signs coming back up.\nSpeaker 8: If we have a graded slope, which actually doesn't look anything like the historical slope that we had there. In fact, you have a picture of that in there, too. So I'd also like to make a quick comment about the Tidelands Fund.\nSpeaker 8: I hear from a lot of people that it doesn't matter how much it cost. It doesn't matter how much waste there is because it's not our taxes. It's the Tidelands Fund. I think we need to have a lot more respect for it.\nSpeaker 8: Already we could see the fund eroding. I think that oil is just not going to be there forever or not profitable enough forever. And we have a whole load of very beneficial projects waiting on the sideline, and some of them are just not going to come to fruition because of waste.\nSpeaker 8: So I urge you, please finish the job we started. It's a great job. It's going to be covered with flora and vines. It's going.\nSpeaker 5: To.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. The time's up, unfortunately. Okay.\nSpeaker 8: That's fine. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Hello. My name is Sasha Witty.\nSpeaker 3: And with a3214 East Second Street.\nSpeaker 4: Where to start? Regarding the bluff. I began going to community meetings with Parks and Rec and city staff years ago as plans were being made for the bluff improvements. I sat through more meetings at Bixby Parks Rec Room, going over, planting options and providing feedback.\nSpeaker 4: Then I can mentally count. There was talk of one or two small areas that would need chocolate. I'm sorry. It was a big pet project of mine when I was.\nSpeaker 2: Working in the neighborhood the last.\nSpeaker 4: Ten years. No one was particularly excited by this, but we were excited. It was limited in smoke and scope and focused with the Parks and Rec staff and all the natural plans that were to be incorporated to stem erosion and create beauty.\nSpeaker 4: Funding was an issue, so we awaited our turn for Tidelands funding. I was one of many that was very excited as the city finally broke ground. Then after a few weeks, I started getting phone calls, concern, phone calls and emails asking if I had gone down to see what was happening at the bluff.\nSpeaker 4: I could not have been more surprised and shocked when I did make it past the work fences. I am saddened to have spent so much personal time trying to be a part of something positive and then in the end result feeling it didn't much matter.\nSpeaker 4: All those discussions that were had between the community and city staff over all those years. My personal desire is that the city honor the original intentions and plans to provide primarily natural landscaping and to avoid these vast expanses of concrete, painted.\nSpeaker 2: And sculpted.\nSpeaker 4: To try and mimic natural rock. My second desire is that the city consider the importance of communication to a community. If in the end there were changes that were essential and unavoidable, much sadness and drama could have been avoided if the city staff would have come back to the community to go over the changes prior to breaking\nSpeaker 4: ground. I would ask for that level of clear communication to all neighborhoods being impacted in the future prior to breaking ground. It is important that all those who do their best to participate in making a positive difference by attending community workshops and planning sessions do not feel that they have wasted their time, but instead feel empowered to\nSpeaker 4: participate once again. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Wendy Hahn. I live at three, two, one four East Second Street in Long Beach. I support a natural bluff. I am opposed to a cement bluff. You might ask, how did we get here? And Why am I standing before you tonight?\nSpeaker 4: Over the past 25 years, residents of Bluff Park, myself included, bordering neighborhoods and concerned citizens, worked diligently with our elected council representatives and city staff to design and fund a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the bluff. After dozens of meetings and numerous proposals over those 25 years with city staff and numerous expert consultants hired by the\nSpeaker 4: city, we move forward with several pilot planning projects, and after a great deal of compromise, it was with great pride that our community believed the hard work was done and a sound proposal approved. We all took a collective sigh of relief.\nSpeaker 4: We now know we should have maintained a watchful and vigilant eye on this most significant city project involving one of our most precious assets, the bluff.\nSpeaker 5: The consequences of this lapse in oversight are.\nSpeaker 4: Well known to all here. It was the recent large scale cementing of the bluff. How could this have happened, you say? I cannot say with certainty. The contributing factors are certainly the retirement or departure of city staff that worked on this project for many, many years, coupled with an apparent loss of many of the historical bluff documents\nSpeaker 4: , plans and agreements. I am truly amazed at the lack of project management that allowed this to happen. Add to that the concurrent rehabilitation of Bluff Park, a seemingly never ending dusty eyesore. And you have a community that is outraged that such a debacle could occur in our front yard.\nSpeaker 4: So what do we do now? We know that there are those that believe cementing the bluff is the only viable engineering solution. Cementing the bluff is the cheapest, most expedient solution. And even at cementing the bluff is the most esthetically pleasing solution.\nSpeaker 4: In other.\nSpeaker 5: Words, since the cementing.\nSpeaker 4: Is so far along and funds have been spent, let the city finish their job. Sorry, folks. I believe nature trumps cement every time. I believe there are affordable environmental alternatives to cementing. In fact, I know there are. I've worked on the Bluff Rehabilitation Project for many years now and have met with numerous experts hired by the city\nSpeaker 4: and none ever advocated massive shot creating. This is never come up in the past. I ask you if cementing was the best solution, why was it never presented as an option during all those years of meeting and planning?\nSpeaker 4: I opposed cementing the bluff. I support honoring agreements. I believe that a vibrant, healthy, stable and beautiful natural bluff is the one and only solution. I believe that we can and must do this. We all deserve so much better than a cement bluff.\nSpeaker 4: The bluff. Our bluff is a precious gem that all of us are charged with protecting and preserving. Thank you so.\nSpeaker 1: Much.\nSpeaker 4: We can do this. Let's do it right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. My name is Alex Monte. I live in Bluff Park on First Street. And as most of you will agree, we live near one of the uglier bluffs in Southern California or beyond. And it's not for lack of trying.\nSpeaker 5: Over the last few years, over the last many years, many techniques have been used shoring walls, Gambians plastic, netting and vegetation, and more recently, soil, nails and shot create. We put in steep slopes and not so steep slopes whose vegetation has been trampled by walkers, a smorgasbord or more precisely, a showroom of bluff remediation techniques for other\nSpeaker 5: communities to learn from. In all this. Where is the master plan? What is our entire bluff going to look like 20 years from now? We've seen what it looked like about 100 years ago and the package that Mr. Watson left for you.\nSpeaker 5: There is an aerial shot from 1927 that shows what the bluff actually looked like at that point. It's a uniformly vertical wall across its entire length, not unlike the short creek sections that have been recently put up. Not a gently sloping grassy field, not an array of rare flowers, so that some would request in a recent grunion\nSpeaker 5: ad but a vertical wall what it had apparently been for the past 100 million years, including when it was an underwater shelf. And since we are in a historic district. Should we not look for historical accuracy? Honorable Council Members, Please do not allow yourself to be influenced by politically well-connected individuals into spending funds that we do not\nSpeaker 5: have and will not have with $50 a barrel oil. Please complete the existing funded project. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please. And before I'm going to cut out the speaker's list, no one else is in line. Mr. Good here. You see, you're the last in line. I will cut off the speaker's list.\nSpeaker 2: Please. Good evening, Mayor. City Council. My name is Gordon and Cage. I live at 235 Loma Avenue. I have the dubious honor of presenting former City Councilman Gary DeLong photographs of what was happening along the Bluff Park Bluffs in April.\nSpeaker 2: And it was with his amazement at those photos that led to the work stoppage and pause.\nSpeaker 4: That led to a peer review, that led to.\nSpeaker 2: An identification of alternatives that you're considering this evening. And I'd like to start by saying, please consider any alternative except Short Creek. It's real simple. And I believe it's very important for you to consider this because it's a community park.\nSpeaker 2: And honestly, I believe that the folks in Bluff Park have been most significantly impacted. But it is a community resource of urban open space and access to nature that many people in our city rely on, and we have an opportunity to restore it.\nSpeaker 2: How often in this presentation did you talk or hear about restoration? Did anybody hear restoration from our city staff this evening? This is an erosion control project. This is stabilization. But it's not. With all due respect, and I would like to thank the new third district city councilwoman for her time, for her efforts, for her interest in\nSpeaker 2: this project. I genuinely thank you. You've made access to you and your staff. Incredible. And. We've had incredibly helpful city staff in this process of information, communication and exchange. Thank you to all of you. It doesn't change the fact that we have a wall of concrete that no one expected and we can fix it.\nSpeaker 2: So I'd like to say that Tidelands Funds got us into this mess, and Tidelands funds should be used to get us out. We have the money. It is available. It's set aside for other projects. And last time I checked, we don't have a new leeway sailing center yet.\nSpeaker 2: We don't have a new pool yet. We don't have a new pier. No construction has started. This is in the midst of an erosion control project. That should be a restoration and we can do it. I have committed to Susie Price that there are alternative funding sources in the nonprofit world that could be used to augment a\nSpeaker 2: possible shortfall of funding for this project. I have friends there sitting in this audience this evening who would be willing to plan and foster a restoration, a community effort that doesn't need shot crit, that doesn't need geotechnical angles and millions of dollars you've heard from and donkey from Redondo Beach.\nSpeaker 2: She knows how to do this. Other communities don't have millions of tidelands.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 2: And thank you. Please vote for something other than chocolate. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Hi. My name is Alan Ross. I live on First Street in the bluff. In my line of work, we have a common aphorism better is the enemy of good. You do a good job and you think you can tweak it a little bit and suddenly you wish you hadn't.\nSpeaker 5: You folks and your predecessors for 15 years have done a very good job, just the sort of thing that we would hope for from our elected officials. You saw the problem. You gathered the resources. You called in experts.\nSpeaker 5: You listen to the experts, and you did what they told you to do. Earlier in the year, there was a question. You put a moratorium in, you called in your experts again, did we do the right thing? And I was here and they said, yes, you did.\nSpeaker 5: You did the right thing, perfect for restoring the bluff. Now you just need to have the political will to finish it. You've done everything right. You've done a very good job. And now we're told we can make it a little better.\nSpeaker 5: It's a very good job.\nSpeaker 11: That you've done for 15.\nSpeaker 5: Years. You just need to finish what you started. Don't spend any more money. Don't spend any more time. It's fine. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Speaker Mr. Mayor. Council Persons I'd like to speak in favor of the first option of the plans, the ones that the staff has prepared. I'm sorry I didn't stay where I live. I live 25, 34, East First Street, a block from this bluff.\nSpeaker 5: I walk on the top of the bluff. I bike under the bluff. The bluff is part of my neighborhood. So anyway, I would like to speak in favor. Then I was like to speak in favor of my neighbors.\nSpeaker 5: You notice how many of us are here? We play together, we socialize together, we work together, we problem solve together. And obviously some of the people who have worked extremely hard at this feel that they have been led down the primrose path because the communications have not been good.\nSpeaker 5: So I would suggest that I'm in favor of this and I'm also in favor of the council looking at what really happened here, that the communication got so bad with the neighborhood that it didn't get resolved in the neighborhood, in a neighborhood that hangs together and has meetings together and really works together to try and solve problems\nSpeaker 5: so that we don't have this kind of division in the neighborhood. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. And our last speaker.\nSpeaker 5: Very good. You click as the addressed shot. There's a but but ugly is the only way to put it. Period is about as inappropriate as the design for the City Hall. No imagination of I'd like to have it all flowers, but obviously that's that can't happen.\nSpeaker 5: But I've got a couple of suggestions that I've toyed around with. One. Well, I've always felt is wherever possible I would plant poison ivy all over the place. I'm absolutely serious to keep the element out. The trash is what?\nSpeaker 5: Well, for in there, period. And I think we put up signs and to the extent we can grow poison ivy, which is nice and green or even poison sumac, put it there. All right. I'm very serious on that.\nSpeaker 5: Also, take a section of it and consider using it as a rock wall. Work with those people that go into the rock climbing business. That's not me. I'm not that. But set off a section. It's a natural for it.\nSpeaker 5: And rocks are? I believe not. They're not expensive bringing in and they're easily, easily transported in and create a natural. You know, you go out into out into Yellowstone or any other place are tons and tons and tons of rocks people climb all over.\nSpeaker 5: Let's take a look at that. And then I would I would surround the poison ivy with window boxes with nice plantings over. But the attempt to plant them on the actual bluff itself, I, I think is a losing proposition.\nSpeaker 5: That's pretty simple. Again, nice and green with poison ivy line with window boxes and a section that would have boulders and work with the the those that are in the business of rock climbing to make it a nice athletic experience.\nSpeaker 5: Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you for public comment. Thank you. All those that came out and spoke. I'm going to turn this over to Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And I think we have a presentation, so hopefully it'll get cued up at some point. And while we're waiting for that, I, too, want to thank everybody who came out. I am going to address it in one of the slides that I prepared, that your community is really a unique community in terms of the relationships\nSpeaker 3: that you all have with one another except for this issue. This issue has been an extremely contentious issue, and it has literally torn apart this community. And I'm going to tell you right now, we're all human and sometimes we do things we don't realize we're doing it.\nSpeaker 3: I've had judges tell me that in court, but sometimes when you're listening to someone and you disagree with them, you know, there's an eye roll or a snicker to your friend. And a lot of that has been going on and it's been going on not just tonight, but for a while now.\nSpeaker 3: When this topic comes up and it really curtails meaningful communication. I'm going to talk a little bit about this this process. I came to your bluff part community meeting, I believe it was in April, I think I don't remember it was Gary's last meeting with you guys.\nSpeaker 3: And it was a very heated meeting. Very heated. And people were yelling at him. I remember it was shortly after I'd been elected and I remember thinking, I think I may have changed my mind. Who do I talk to about this?\nSpeaker 3: But I do remember at one point, you know, someone yelled at him, you know, we pay your salary. You, you, we we deserve to have you be on top of these issues. I just want you guys to know that I calculated the number of hours that I've put into the Bluff Park issue, preparing for tonight just over\nSpeaker 3: the last two weeks. And you've paid me a salary of $6.75 an hour because there's a lot of work. And so I just I say that to you because I want regardless of how the vote turns out tonight, I'd like a little grace from you.\nSpeaker 3: And because it is an emotional issue and even tonight, you know, I received an email that was just very upsetting to me because when we spend time with you, I've met with every single person who's asked to meet with me except Isaac.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry, I couldn't squeeze it in, but every single person I've met with you as many times as you've wanted to meet with me. Just because we disagree on an item doesn't mean that I'm a bad person or that you.\nSpeaker 3: You know, it just honestly, we just we have to get over that because that's what's been dividing your community. So I'm going to address that in a moment. But all right. So the staff really covered a lot of this, but I just wanted to talk just a little bit about where we've been.\nSpeaker 3: So tonight's we've heard their staff recommendation. We got the Kleinfeld analysis in November, the memo from the city manager and in November. As well. Peer review report was in June. We all read that the memo from the city manager in May prior to me taking office and what we have reviewed, what I've reviewed in preparation for tonight\nSpeaker 3: . So I'm listing for you every single thing that I've read word for word. I've received over 300 emails from residents just since last week on this issue three that I will tell you right now, of all the issues that we have addressed in the last six months, this has been the issue that I have received the most\nSpeaker 3: feedback on. And I don't know why that is. I don't know if there was like an email campaigns going on or an ad and I don't know what was going on, but we received a lot of emails and we did our own survey through the third district.\nSpeaker 3: And let me just you know, it's it's astonishing to me that you would attempt to do outreach and then get criticism, because we've had people say, well, is that a true survey technique? It looked like it was weighted.\nSpeaker 3: And what kind of a who put that survey together? It is an opportunity and an effort by our office to reach out to people. And what I would like to do is really encourage you guys, I'm going to put some information on here for anyone who's watching at home.\nSpeaker 3: We put it we sent a survey out to about a thousand people. We started creating our own email lists in July when I took office. So we have about a thousand emails. We didn't reach out to everyone because we don't have everyone's email address, but we also put it on Facebook.\nSpeaker 3: We have about a thousand followers there. We tried to educate the people the best that we could. We sent an email to every association president and the third and asked them to forward the staff report. And we were able to get a lot of great feedback.\nSpeaker 3: I got, you know, some criticism from people saying, you know, well, did you have an expert put together the survey? No, I didn't. I'm a councilwoman who's your neighbor. And I'm trying to say, what do you think about this?\nSpeaker 3: It's really that simple. It's not a statistical analysis. It's public outreach. I've gone on multiple walks prior to being elected and after being in office with interested folks who wanted to show me and point out areas of the bluff.\nSpeaker 3: We've held a community meeting at the field office to talk about the different alternatives in the staff report. I met with and city staff has also met with bio technical or regrading proponents on multiple occasions beginning in August.\nSpeaker 3: Until last weekend who met with proponents of continuing the work since last week. Those folks have really come out. The ones who want the project to continue. I've had in-person and phone conferences with experts in this field who live in our community, not necessarily in Bluff Park, but throughout the community.\nSpeaker 3: It's a very contentious issue. The process began in the late nineties and the master plan was issued in 2000. Community meetings were held at that time. In 2009 and ten, full geotechnical investigation was prepared and soil nails and shot crit were recommended.\nSpeaker 3: In 2010, Council approved the use of soil nails and Shot Creek. Plans and specifications were approved by council in July of 2013 prior to me taking office. The process went through multiple entities. Coastal was involved. Zoning Administrator, City Council.\nSpeaker 3: Phase one was completed in 2011. City Staff and Councilman DeLong walked along the Bluff Bluff at that time and discussed landscaping. Presentation of Phase two was made to the Parks and Rec Commission in 2012, prior to Phase two being completed.\nSpeaker 3: That was completed in 2014. Where we are today, we entered into a contract with Drill TEC, which is the company that administered and implemented the shot create in 2013. We stopped the project midway in April of 2014. The company had to demobilize at a cost of roughly $80,000 and to mobilize.\nSpeaker 3: We will have to pay the company in excess of $150,000. Is that correct, Mr. Modica. Mr. Lopez. We can fact check that. But I think it's roughly in the 150 range.\nSpeaker 11: Of the 80,000, you're correct, is the original estimate that we had from our from the DeLay memo. I think we've calculated that, as you put it. And together, I think the the regional mobilization and demobilization together is about $420,000.\nSpeaker 3: So that is the cost of setting the project. So for anyone who doesn't like the outcome of tonight, the one thing you can walk away with is the city spent $400,000 to study the option I wanted them to study or we wanted them to study.\nSpeaker 3: Failure to honor our contract with drill tech will result in financial consequences. The costs will be near the original contract amount, which is over $4 million. The cost of canceling this contract. We have limited, realistic options. You know, when you take office, one of my colleagues here, I won't say the person's name has said to me multiple\nSpeaker 3: times, you don't just you can't hit reset every time there's a new council person in office. And that's true, because when we start a project, when we start a program, when we make changes to our staffing model based on whatever decision was made prior to us, and we come in and we want to unwind that, certainly we\nSpeaker 3: can do that. But there are financial and legal consequences to doing that. It's not as simple as just saying, what's the best thing? What do we want to do? Forget all the consequences. Let's just do what we believe.\nSpeaker 3: The best thing is there are legal consequences and financial consequences, and this is an example of that situation. We're in a position where we need to be extremely mindful of the costs that we approve. As a council, we are going into deficit years.\nSpeaker 3: Our oil revenues are down. Every single dollar we spend has to be justified. Every single dollar. That is our reality as a city. It absolutely is a reality as a city. We've heard arguments. You know, sometimes people think, you know, when you're an elected official, you have no emotions or response to things.\nSpeaker 3: That's not true. One of the things I've heard repeatedly is, you know well where her priorities are messed up because she's approving a pool and building the Naples seawalls and not spending the money on this project. Well, you know, personally, I don't believe that that's a very responsible argument, because you can make an argument at any time\nSpeaker 3: for whatever it is you feel passionate about. Let's say, for example, in a household, you could make the argument up. There's nothing more important in a household than the home that you live in. We should we should live in the best home that we can.\nSpeaker 3: That is absolutely something we should not sacrifice on or education. The education and the amount of money we spend on our children should be the utmost important, highest priority. We should spend our money on education. Well, you can make that passionate plea for just about anything.\nSpeaker 3: But the reality of life is you have to look at the totality of the situation and consider it all as a package. Naples Sea walls and the pool are completely unrelated to the bluff. With Naples seawalls, we have some safety concerns.\nSpeaker 3: Are we going to delay the Naples seawalls to pursue an alternative that has already that? And I'm going to address it in a moment. Would it make sense for us to do that? It would not. The pool is not being built, and it won't be built until we have money.\nSpeaker 3: And I don't know when that's going to be. But it's not like we are going to take money away from the bluff to build the pool. Money for the bluff has been allocated. A lot of money has been allocated for the bluff.\nSpeaker 3: When you look at Tidelands projects, a lot of money has been allocated for bluff restoration and now some are arguing it's not enough money. Our options are continue the shot create project that would result in us not breaching our contract with Drill Tech.\nSpeaker 3: We'll be able to come up with the money to do it now. Some of you may be taking that for granted. You know, let's just go with option one. It's not going to cost us any money. That's not true.\nSpeaker 3: We still have to come up with the 1.3 million or whatever it is because we hadn't anticipated. The amount of money that we were going to lose as a result of the study. And that's just a reality. And so we're going to have to come up with 1.3 million or somewhere around that number to fund this this\nSpeaker 3: project. And I think I think we might be able to do it, but that money is not just sitting there right now. We're going to be able to scrape it together. I think maybe we will have a consistent look along that portion of the block.\nSpeaker 3: That's been something that's been raised by a lot of folks. Is that the shot create, if it's completed, will be more consistent than a patchwork of different applications. We can speed up. Oh, and we can spend any future money that we have on enhancing the vegetation, which I think is a really, really important, valid point.\nSpeaker 3: I'll just be the first to say that our city and most municipalities that I've been involved in, having worked for multiple municipalities as a city attorney, maintenance is not always the strong suit of city governments. And that's just the reality, because projects and creating new projects is always the priority.\nSpeaker 3: So maintenance is an I'm I'm concern. My biggest concern is what are we going to do about the vegetation and how are we going to make sure that we have thriving plants in that area? What's the city's plan for that?\nSpeaker 3: That's that's my biggest concern with this project. The project would finish in 2015. We can implement one of the two bio technical alternatives. That would require us to breach our contract. So we have the financial penalties. We'd have to come up with an additional 3 million to 6 million to complete the project, depending on which of the\nSpeaker 3: two alternatives we pick. Construction would begin in 2015, and there are some risks associated with these two options. And I'm going to I'm going to cite from the report and a couple of slides, but the stability is not guaranteed of either of those two projects.\nSpeaker 3: The third option is to consider the feasibility study, the cost and feasibility of the regrading option. We'll need to breach our contract. We'll need to figure out how to come up with the additional 4 million. The project wouldn't start until 2016 or 17 and we'd have to be okay extending the toe of the bluff or taking away\nSpeaker 3: from the.\nSpeaker 4: Beach.\nSpeaker 3: To regrade because we absolutely do not want to take away from the park. I mean, that is one thing that I've heard repeatedly, and it's something that's been echoed for years now, for over a decade. What are people saying?\nSpeaker 3: And by the way, we had a lot of responses to our survey. I'll tell you that number right now, unless it was already in there, overwhelmingly, people want it to continue with the Shock Creek project. I'll give you that number in just a moment.\nSpeaker 3: Over 120, I think, responses we received. Some have said the look of the shot, Crete is ugly. Some have said it is a completely subjective call. It is a completely subjective call. There are people in this room who thinks that it looks better.\nSpeaker 3: I see some head shaking, but I will tell you that there are people who have said it looks better and there are people who have said they don't like it. It's a completely subjective call. This is photos of it for those who haven't been out there.\nSpeaker 3: This is just from yesterday. One of the biggest arguments that we've heard and that I've talked to experts about is the stability. The shot create is the only application. The only application designed to provide long term stability and erosion control that we have received expert analysis on.\nSpeaker 3: And this is so that in the event of an earthquake or changes due to sea level rise, we would have some stability there. We do assume some risks with all three of the other options. In fact, on page ten of the Kleinfeld report, it says, Without successful vegetation on the slope, erosion and superficial instability will continue.\nSpeaker 3: Hence, bio technical options hold greater risk for future instability than does the designed shot create slope. I think the decision in regards to what the best option is requires a review of the totality of the facts and circumstances that we have and based on the totality of the information that we have.\nSpeaker 3: I think the only reasonable and prudent alternative is option one, which is to complete the original project. So I will be supporting staff's recommendation. As I said, you know, this is. You know, how this process unfolded was not the best example of the city's efforts to conduct public outreach.\nSpeaker 3: They really I mean, I don't I don't want to criticize anyone that came before me because certainly I'm going to make many mistakes as well. And I don't really think it had to do with the with the the electeds or the staff.\nSpeaker 3: It was just the outreach process. I think that some people that I respect a lot who spoke tonight spoke clearly when they talked about how hurtful and painful it is. When you feel like you've been part of a process and really you feel like you were ignored.\nSpeaker 3: That's that's huge. And I want to talk about that because my commitment to each and every one of you is that we will talk about projects before they become a reality. We just last week, my staff and I and the city staff went on a walk through with Naples residents, and we went by every single tree that's\nSpeaker 3: being removed and talked about why that tree is being removed. And some trees had been removed prior to our getting there and the residents really wanted to know what was going on. And when we went there and we realized what the seawall plan was, those trees could not remain.\nSpeaker 3: And it was clear to everyone because we were all in it together. We were all learning together, side by side, what our limitations were. And that should have happened here. People feel that their concerns were ignored. And this has been a very contentious issue in the Bluff Park community.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that some people it's such an emotionally charged issue may have not been very respectful and emails and things. And I would hope that you guys would work together to to make that right going forward. One of your residents told me yesterday, I asked her to tell me what it is that she loved about Bluff\nSpeaker 3: Park. Should I love Bluff Park for the diversity of residents, the incredible variety of historic architectural styles, the wide open expanse of the big sky. When you stand and look from the bluff, the small town feeling in the midst of a big metropolis, the proximity to wonderful and unique shopping and dining, the feeling of sand between my\nSpeaker 3: toes just steps away from my home and the ability to watch the sunset over the ocean while watching the Pelicans feed in the early evening. That is Bluff Park. And I hope that whether you agree with this decision that we're going to make tonight or that you don't you at least respect the time that we put into\nSpeaker 3: it and know that you're you're our office is always open and available to listen to you, and we will always meaningfully consider your options. So with that, I would make a motion to accept staff's recommendation.\nSpeaker 1: There's been a motion and second to accept steps. Recommendation. Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 4: I want to thank you all for being here tonight, but I also want to thank Councilwoman Price for first grossly overestimating her salary over the last two weeks. I have seen Councilwoman Price at community events, charity events, at least a few hours of singing in the boat parade together.\nSpeaker 4: Agenda Prep for today calls with colleagues on a myriad of issues, including standing water, lack of drainage, sober living homes, business licenses. And as you may have noticed, there's another 15 items left on the agenda which we haven't gotten to today.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. For those of you who are out from my district who are still waiting patiently and being a part of this important process. The due diligence done on this has been exceptional. Thank you to the city staff for going through every single option.\nSpeaker 4: And you have my support tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 7: Yes. Thank you very much. I've been certainly listening this also. And I would just like to say for my Councilwoman Price. I know the efforts and energies put into this because she was left with quite a task, you know, and Jerry left.\nSpeaker 7: But I think she's done everything that was possible to try to please individuals. And I do not have to be any as long as I know you can't please everyone. But I think that her heart and soul is in everything she does for district.\nSpeaker 7: And I would like to commend you on the things that you're doing and keep up the good work. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. We're going to we're going to go and go to a vote. I want to make a comment and then we're going to go to the vote. I want to just first start by thanking Councilwoman Pryce.\nSpeaker 1: I think that was a well-organized and thoughtful presentation. I've seen firsthand the amount of work that the councilwoman is putting into this job. It is she is everywhere, continuously working, meeting with residents, listening. I think her her experience as an attorney is serving the council and the community well.\nSpeaker 1: Also, I also want to thank city staff. I think you guys have done a fantastic job from Eric Lopez, Tom Modica. The whole team have done a great a great job on this project. And I want to say also, as someone that was here when the initial project came forward, stopping a project midway is very, very rare\nSpeaker 1: . In fact, I don't know that since I've been on the council we had ever done that. And I think that we did it because certainly there was a councilmember DeLong came forward with some suggestions, there was community concern, but I think it showed the due diligence of staff and the council to go through this process.\nSpeaker 1: We made an investment to ensure that we would come up with a solution that would be the right solution for the community. And so I want to thank staff for for doing and going back and doing the research and the additional work that it took because that is a very unique moment that we had, I think, as\nSpeaker 1: a city council. But like Councilwoman said, we came back. We're at this moment now and it just reinforces, I think, the work and staff's work up to this point. And so I want to thank you again, councilwoman and councilman, pressure on make an additional comment.\nSpeaker 3: I did. I just wanted to say that the survey that we did, we had 71, I think we had 123 or something to that effect, and 71% favored completing their original project.\nSpeaker 1: So okay with that, thank you. And let's go and go to the vote.\nSpeaker 2: Motion carries six zero.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And I want to thank all everyone that came out today. Thank you all for coming down. I know it's it's always difficult to come out to council meetings, but we appreciate your your voice and your input.\nSpeaker 1: Madam Clerk, next item.\nSpeaker 2: Hearing number one North required report from Public Works Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record.

Council Member Pierce. Council Member Supernanny. Councilman Andrew's recommendation to receive and file report from the Long Beach Innovation Team on the Newson Motels pilot program explored the feasibility of a citywide news and motel ordinance and explore the feasibility of implementing a motel amortization program.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So first, I want to thank all the folks who are who are here and waited patiently through our city council meeting. This is ever given Tuesday. So I'm glad you're able to be here and witness our our proceedings.\nSpeaker 6: I want to thank council members Andrews Pearson Supernova for lending their names in support of this conversation. So for decades, North Long Beach neighborhoods all across our city have been facing persistent blight, crime, violence associated with outdated nuisance motels.\nSpeaker 6: In many cases, human trafficking, drug activity and violent crime has really taken root in these motels. In fact, in the past three years, our police department has gotten 3189 calls for service for violent crime in files 772 crime incident reports on the six worst motels alone.\nSpeaker 6: That's just six. Not to mention the continued drain on public resources from police department. Fire code enforcement. Nuisance abatement. Health Department. City Prosecutors. Department. We know that these problem motels are located all across the city. But let's just hone in on one corridor for a moment on Long Beach Boulevard in North Long Beach, between the 17 freeway\nSpeaker 6: and Forehand Street, or just about Artesia, where the 91 is, that's just a half of a mile stretch. The corridor is lined with five outdated motels. And recently, our innovation team analyzed calls for service and incident report records for all motel and hotel locations in Long Beach over the last three, three and a half years.\nSpeaker 6: And that narrowed it down to some six of the worst motels in the city. And frankly, on this corridor, two of the six worst in the city are adjacent to each other on this corridor. To give you a snapshot, between January 2014 and May 2017, Luxury Inn and the Sierra Motel had 1501 calls for service in that\nSpeaker 6: three year span and 237 crime reports on Long Beach Boulevard between those two motels, most notably last April. A tragic incident occurred at that luxury in prompting SWAT to evacuate evacuate the residents from Coolidge Triangle neighborhoods for more than 8 hours as police search for a gunman.\nSpeaker 6: Aside from the loss of life, this incident required over 80 police personnel to respond to this crime. I must say that again, 80 police personnel were taken off the streets to address one motel for 8 hours. Could you imagine what those police officers could have been doing if they weren't addressing this one motel?\nSpeaker 6: Immediately following, we pulled together a meeting city manager. Our human trafficking folks are our development services folks to sort out an action plan and a pilot program to hold property owners accountable for that crime, human trafficking and violence that takes place at their establishments.\nSpeaker 6: And as a response to that meeting, staff began a pilot program, a multiple multiply, multiple department effort to address the ongoing blight and nuisances associated with these these high calls for service motels. And so at this time, I'd love to just hear Quick Report on the two from four or how the pilot program is going.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. West, I'm going to turn this over to our I-Team director, Traci Conger.\nSpeaker 3: Honorable mayor and city council. Just to give you a brief history, in 2017, the nuisance motel's pilot program was initiated by the city manager. After several discussions with Vice Mayor Richardson about community concerns in North Long Beach. City staff from the prosecutor's office, city attorney's office, development Services, Health Police, Fire, financial management departments and a Long Beach\nSpeaker 3: Innovation Team have met to address ongoing issues involving nuisance motels in our city. Specifically, staff focused on motels that meet the criteria of a nuisance location as defined by the Long Beach Municipal Code and those experiencing high volume of police related calls for service.\nSpeaker 3: To identify trends and establish baseline averages for police activity at motel locations in the city, staff collected and aggregated calls for service and incident report records for all motel and hotel locations in Long Beach from January 1st, 2014 through May 31st, 2017.\nSpeaker 3: The data sets were analyzed separately and weighted by activity type. Calls for service were weighed by priority level to correspond with response time with priority one calls having the highest weight. Incident reports were weighted by part one and Part two, crimes that correspond with the FBI uniform crime reporting codes.\nSpeaker 3: Each motel was then assigned a final index, scored for both datasets and weighted once more by the number of rooms at each location. The final scores provide baseline values to track police activity in Long Beach going forward by location, type of establishment and size, as well as quarterly trends over time, which you can see in these two\nSpeaker 3: slides. We have both calls for service as well as incidents over each quarter. The results from the police data analysis will go down to the locations with the highest scores from which six locations were selected for a pilot program.\nSpeaker 3: The city has several programs in place as part of its effort to combat nuisance related activity. Between 2005 and 2009 through the redevelopment agency, the city purchased and abated approximately 12 nuisance motels. The current nuisance abatement ordinance and other various code enforcement policies represent other long standing abatement programs in the city.\nSpeaker 3: Staff has initiated a pilot program again with the six motels listed. Site visits to pilot locations are focused on interdepartmental collaboration, community support and partnerships with motel owners and managers. This model balances enforcement with support to motel managers provided by city staff.\nSpeaker 3: The city must look to other solutions with minimal fiscal impact to address nuisance motels. Opportunity exists to incorporate zoning and land use changes in the city's existing efforts, including the Uptown Livable Zoning and Investment Plan, also known as Up Plan.\nSpeaker 3: This could incentivize motel owners to convert their properties to more viable uses, such as mixed income and or mixed use housing and commercial centers. Staff recommends continuing the pilot program through the end of fiscal year 18 to further develop recommendations and solutions for these establishments while we search to identify funding opportunities.\nSpeaker 3: This concludes my report. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. And and Tracy, thank you for that. That your hard work. And just so folks know, the city is committed to fighting this issue and addressing this issue when you have a response from eight separate departments working collaboratively to address this.\nSpeaker 6: So, you know, the pilot program is a great first step at addressing the immediate sort of negative impacts. So that's that's that's suppression. That's a response. But as we heard, you know, as you may know, many cities, including Chula Vista, Anaheim and Oakland, are taking more formal action to combat these crime infested motels by looking at both\nSpeaker 6: short term and long term solutions. People people who have lived on that corridor for 20, 30 years can tell you human trafficking along Beach Boulevard is not new. When the city when the city council, when the city cracks down, it's like a water balloon.\nSpeaker 6: We crack down for a little while and the issues just moved to Compton in Lynwood. And when the Compton sheriffs crack down, they squeeze on the other side of the balloon. It pops right back up in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: So we've got to not necessarily look at just suppression. When we look at how much resources go into it, we have to look at short term and long term strategies. So based on the success that we learned, we're learning from the pilot motel program along with best practices from other jurisdictions.\nSpeaker 6: Part of the My motion tonight is recommend staff explore the feasibility of implementing a citywide nuisance motel ordinance that will hold motel owners accountable for the things that take place in their property and really ask for a higher standard.\nSpeaker 6: No matter what era you live in, you live in a higher standard for motels, and so we can use the tools we already have in this ordinance, but really take a look at sort of retooling our fees, our fines to create something that accelerates our administrative process to bring them into compliance.\nSpeaker 6: An ordinance will give us the leverage we need to set performance standards, impose administrative penalties on property owners, allowing criminal activity to take place on their premises. An ordinance can incorporate existing and expanded standards, including proposed security measures, such as increased lighting and security cameras.\nSpeaker 6: Right now, the city is installing security cameras along Beach Boulevard because of the activity taking place at the motels. The motels should be required to put in security cameras so there's not the taxpayers putting up those resources. Increased environmental regulations to ensure healthy conditions, as well as a visitation requirement that assures accountability enforcement and enforcement at establishments\nSpeaker 6: . Additionally, I will hope to see best practices from other jurisdictions incorporated into the ordinance. For example, in Chula Vista, the city mandated mandated motel go guests show ID and register their plate number, as with the motel as a requirement of checking in.\nSpeaker 6: These security protocols have been shown, have been proven to reduce crime and to actually assist our vice detectives with investigating when something does happen. You'd have that I.D., you'd have that car registration, you'd have that information. We've we already have a proven track record of implementing successful nuisance abatement ordinances here in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: Our award winning alcohol nuisance abatement ordinance has been very effective in decreasing crime and blight associated with liquor stores across our city. It started off again as a pilot and then expanded citywide. This this establishes a steady operational requirements that improve public safety, including the removal of payphones, unauthorized signage, advertisements, exterior, you know, and other catalysts for\nSpeaker 6: loitering and other unlawful activities. So it's currently and is currently in its fourth phase. Again, it started in North Long Beach in its fourth phase of implementation with near 100% compliance rating from liquor stores. So I would hope that the motel ordinance and the strategy leverages a similar strategy as we took with with the alcohol ordinance.\nSpeaker 6: We know that targeting structural conditions and environmental site issues as well as holding property owners accountable for illegal activity is an effective strategy. Not just reducing to not just reduce crime, but also helps set the standard for a long term permanent solution.\nSpeaker 6: So so the third piece of this is really I'm recommending that staff look at the feasibility of implementing some long term permanent solutions as well that address overconcentration. So we're not talking about going after every motel, but if there are two or three of these nuisance motels right next to each other.\nSpeaker 6: Right now there's five along Beach Boulevard. There's not a tourist destination. There's no reason for that. So what can we do to address the overconcentration and address the issue long term and permanently? So changes land use and zoning in order to phase out motels where tourism no longer exists.\nSpeaker 6: That's that's a strategy we can utilize. Opportunities explore zoning and land use changes in up plan like as discussed to incentivize motel owners to convert to some other more appropriate use. We can begin the conversation around amortization. That's something that, you know, that essentially deems motels and high crime corridors as legal, non-conforming and sets a timeline to\nSpeaker 6: bring it into compliance. We should take a look at that. We've used it in other instances, such as with car dealerships and Long Beach Boulevard when it was it was most feasible when applied to over concentrated areas. City of Gardena just used amortization to address two nuisance gentleman clubs in Gardena.\nSpeaker 6: The process started many years ago, but they finally they started. They set the clock and when the clock ended, those two gentlemen's clubs closed down. So they started it when they said, hey, they only need to operate in industrial industrial spaces or they made a land use choice and that started the clock.\nSpeaker 6: If we started this clock 20 years ago, we wouldn't be in the position today. So it doesn't mean that motel would be necessarily shut down, but it actually allows us to think about the vision for the corridor with all this conversation about visioning taking place.\nSpeaker 6: So the conversation is really simple. We know that human trafficking and crime has taken root in many of these motels. I know it resonates. Know it. We know the average human trafficking victim in California is 14 years old and that California harbors three of the FBI's highest sex trafficking areas in the nation L.A., San Francisco and San\nSpeaker 6: Diego today. Currently, children walking along Beach Boulevard on the way to Colin Powell, Keith Reed School, Colin Powell Academy are being approached by pimps. We know that people in audience know that they've heard these these stories especially. And we know that some motel owners are complicit.\nSpeaker 6: They're working with some of these networks. So if we know these things and Vice is investing in these things, we continue to place a focus on succession. At some point, we are complicit as a city if we don't think about a long term solution.\nSpeaker 6: So, you know, so I'll summarize by saying what we're looking at is three things. The pilot is immediate suppression. Short term is a faster process to respond through an ordinance. And long term, we want to look at some way to update, some way to leverage processes or incentives or updating land use to address the overconcentration.\nSpeaker 6: Those are the three things I want to I want to just acknowledge that there was a letter from the motel association that came out came out today. And so whoever whoever you are, I encourage you to work with city staff.\nSpeaker 6: I've talked with them. They're going to open up the doors and talk with you about what will or will not transpire. But thank you for stepping up. We didn't get where we are with liquor stores, without the liquor store owners stepping up.\nSpeaker 6: So we actually welcome that. I want to thank again the co-sponsors, Pearce, Super Norton Andrews, and encourage the city council support tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Vice Mayor, again for your great leadership on this item. And to all of those that have waited to hear this item on a long council night, I absolutely support this item wholeheartedly. I think that it's a step in the right direction.\nSpeaker 5: I do have a couple questions in my district. Some of these top six are actually in my district. And I know that our muni code and I just want to ask staff a question on how we handle the situation.\nSpeaker 5: We have our muni code says that a responsible party shall not be prohibited from knowingly renting or leasing to an individual guestroom in a hotel or motel to one or more sex offenders. Yada, yada, yada. And no sex offenders should reside within 2000 feet from any public or private school.\nSpeaker 5: The walking distance between Franklin Middle School and the Long Beach Motel on Seventh Street is a little over 1000 feet. So I'm wondering, have we done any work with that motel in particular on ensuring that they're following the guidelines per muni code?\nSpeaker 5: Sorry to spring that on you guys.\nSpeaker 1: No, it's okay. Thank you. Councilmember, at this point, we're working to establish those relationships and be able to provide the appropriate enforcement with code enforcement as well as the police department.\nSpeaker 5: So we currently don't have a practice in place to make sure that that's not happening.\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And is that part of this pilot program that's already in place?\nSpeaker 1: We are developing a compliance plan, which is as a series of corrective issues items. And we're meeting with the hoteliers and their managers to go over what we think are the menu items that are applicable for those particular motels.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I want to recognize the fact that these are hotspots for human trafficking. And I want to applaud the work that the human trafficking task force has done. I know when you first came to this city, a lot of folks said it probably wasn't that big of a deal.\nSpeaker 5: And so recognizing this and saying that we really have to chip away at these little bitty pieces, this is, you know, Franklin Middle Schools is a big concern for me. The same issue that the vice mayor raised where you have kids walking down the street and being approached by individuals is alarming.\nSpeaker 5: So I want to make sure that that is included in the next report that we get back. I also want to talk about some of the work that's been done in L.A. and I know that this really was an item that was focused on the fact that these were crime zones.\nSpeaker 5: And obviously, these numbers are very shocking to see. But I also want to recognize that we in the city have said that dealing with homelessness is a big challenge. I know that we have vouchers that sometimes we place people in some of these motels.\nSpeaker 5: But I want to really make sure that in a report back that we're looking at things like the City of L.A. did, which was an interim motel conversion ordinance where we would say, if, you know, perhaps if they fall into the amortization and we're saying we have too many of these, that we're working on an incentive program\nSpeaker 5: , working with our county, working with our health department to say let's have transitional housing where we have a connection to wraparound services. That is a need that we desperately need in the city. And it would provide oversight. It would ensure that we have people in those previous motels turned to housing that would have staff making sure that\nSpeaker 5: we have a safe place for people to get on their feet. And so I want to make sure that that's part of a report back as you guys are doing this work coming out of the health department, if that's okay.\nSpeaker 5: Fantastic. All right. I'm done. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 3: I just want to say thank you, vice Mayor, for bringing this forward. This is very important. I have and the first district, we have a ton of motels along seventh and new new motels looking to come. And I think that we need to address this issue first and abate it first and tackle what we can before moving\nSpeaker 3: forward with additional options. And so thanks so much. I look forward to, you know, seeing where this ends up. And just thank you so much for the work.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I think.\nSpeaker 8: This is a great item. It's proactive. I know Rex and his residents at the ninth District have been working very hard to to address this this nuisance and this problem. And it is very much it has been an issue up North Long Beach Boulevard.\nSpeaker 8: I've seen it, witnessed it myself. And I think this is a very proactive, strong approach. However, and what I like most about the report is the fact that it identified the most problem motels. Right. It identified those and it didn't necessarily paint all motel operators with a wide brush.\nSpeaker 8: It said, you know, we're going to go after and identify the nuisance sites and work to abate those. I know for a fact that, you know, I have motels in my district as well. Not all of them are the best.\nSpeaker 8: But we actually have some some examples of, I think, very well-run and responsible motel operators who I think in this conversation should be be also stakeholders. When you talk about best practices, because there are some some some good ones.\nSpeaker 8: And I think we have some some representatives here from a couple of the motels in a district who who want to be part of the conversation as well. And so as we move forward with staff in terms of looking at feasibility and implementing, you know, an ordinance, I think we should make sure that we're talking to everybody\nSpeaker 8: . And so I would invite that that conversation. I hope you're amenable to that. Vice Mayor Richardson as well. So thank you very much. I'm really looking forward to hearing from the public, though. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman. A. Thank you. I'll just follow up on what Councilmember Austin just said, if I can ask the vice mayor for just a little more clarification. We were contacted at almost 4 p.m. this afternoon by a group, and we had another event to start at 4:04 p.m. that had just heard about this.\nSpeaker 1: So if you can explain. And they were asking for a 30 day continuance. Can you reiterate what you said before, that this is a work in progress? We're not making a decision tonight that they will have time to weigh in on this.\nSpeaker 6: Sure. Thank you. So just to be clear, we had a conversation after the letter to make sure that if there is someone is going to step up and sort of represent those interests, they should have a seat at the table.\nSpeaker 6: So I'm looking to Oscar. We had this conversation. Oscar's nodding. He's acknowledging, so, yeah, we're going to bring him to the table so there's no need for a continuance. Let's start the process and have the conversation.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo. Actually, I'm very happy to see this going forward in the way it is, because I think that there's anything that we need to have. It's more participation from from those affected, from the stakeholders, as well as people who are most affected by it.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that when we finish at the end of the day, that we're going to come up with a better, better solution to dealing with human trafficking and being able to at least minimize it and maybe even benefit from it in terms of being able to transition some of these hotels into, you know, some homeless housing\nSpeaker 1: and affordable housing and some accommodations of being able to bring people in when they need the the housing the most, especially that we're looking at opportunities for.\nSpeaker 8: Home.\nSpeaker 1: I mean, temporary housing. And this is a good opportunity to look at that. It's a creative way that the city can look at in terms of how to deal with its housing issues. And I'm looking forward to the results of the study at the end of the day.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you very much. With that, we're gonna hear from the public. So please come down and just line up at the podium and.\nSpeaker 4: I feel like I'm out of retirement.\nSpeaker 1: Welcome. Welcome back. Welcome back. I'm going to sing that song for you. Welcome back. Welcome back. Welcome back.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of the city council. I am standing here in support and strong support of the Citywide Nuisance Motel ordinance. And I have to tell you, as a resident in North Long Beach and in my district and in the Coolidge Triangle area, we greatly appreciate the attention that we believe that has been long\nSpeaker 4: overdue and that we deserve accountability is the cornerstone of this ordinance. As a taxpayer, I have grown weary of picking up the tab for the property owners of these motels that have been costing us money and adding to our deficit.\nSpeaker 4: As a 25 year property owner in the Coolidge Triangle neighborhood who has had the privilege of living among some of the finest residents in this city. I am confident in saying Colors Triangle and other North Long Beach homeowners and neighborhoods are deeply concerned about our neighbors, about our neighborhood.\nSpeaker 4: And we are fierce protectors of our neighborhoods. We are hyper vigilant against anyone who does not live in our neighborhood. We really we look after each other in ways that I think would probably be the envy of others.\nSpeaker 4: We have phone trees. We keep in contact with each other. We are always looking out for the children and for our elders. And it's just been a phenomenal place to live. And and we do really kind of get a little sensitive on the fact that because of the demographics, you know, we have the largest population of homeownership\nSpeaker 4: in North Long Beach, the certainly the largest population of first time people of color who are property owners in North Long Beach. And our homes are worth, you know, quite a bit. We have a major economic investment. So the dubious distinction of being a high crime area, etc., etc., it really kind of rubs against the grain because\nSpeaker 4: these issues do happen and they are the reason why we're here. But the neighborhoods are quality neighborhoods. This proposal is among the best that the city has advanced in a long time, and we really appreciate it. I want to make the point that when we talk about the children not being able to walk to school, you know\nSpeaker 4: what? For those of us use the bike to take the bus to work, sitting at that bus stop became very dangerous thing for the person speaking because in the morning there would be individuals trying to, well, proposition you.\nSpeaker 4: And so it became very problematic, which forced me to have to now, you know, drive to work, taking a walk along Long Beach Boulevard in the in a in a summer evening or, you know, just simply having a stroll to jack in the box becomes a problem because of the neighborhood nuisance of these motels.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you for bringing this forward. Councilman Richardson, you did an outstanding job with your report. And we are here to back this measure 100%. Thank you. Because we appreciate the neighborhoods that we live in and we want them to be better.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. On an open air vice mayor staff, many of the members from my north Long Beach neighborhood are seated behind me and in line. My name is Dan Press Burg. I'm the president of the DeForest Park Neighborhood Association.\nSpeaker 1: My information is on file. We in North Long Beach are in support of the pilot program. It addresses nuisance properties and their exorbitant expense in man hours and first responders by police and fire. The expense in human lives.\nSpeaker 1: From human trafficking and on crime. That is why the focus has been so specific on those six motels tonight. And however, I'm going to just address two corridors. That's the Atlantic corridor and Long Beach Boulevard. I drove those corridors when I was working full time.\nSpeaker 1: You could not stop without somebody knocking on your window and saying, Hey, how about a date? That's horrible. A nuisance. Motel pilot program pinpoints the activities on blighted corridors affecting the adjacent neighborhoods. That is why these motels were looked at, and that's why they're most troublesome.\nSpeaker 1: This was a multi departmental program with an effort to address the ongoing issues, and we've had some of these before over on Pacific Coast Highway, where they were converted over to education sources and somehow it disappeared. The pilot program identifies trends and establishes a baseline for police activities at the motels throughout the city.\nSpeaker 1: It monitors calls for service incidents. Reports and records have already been analyzed and the program needs to keep going on. And Rex has already said that he's going to dangle a carrot and put a carrot so we can all be at the table to talk about this.\nSpeaker 1: The pilot program will conclude this September three review review of the pilot program established, just like I said, the best practices and many, many cities. We'd like to thank the Vice Mayor for his vision, his vigilance and consistent care of our community and the neighborhoods of North Long Beach that the Forest Park Association.\nSpeaker 1: And also there's a there's an alliance that we have are in full support of the new ordinance as it as it progresses and as it addresses the specific needs of the neighborhoods and the human element involved in human trafficking that focuses into our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 1: It also addresses some of the issues that lead to drugs, crime and other interdiction, as well as eliminating what has been a blight on our community for many, many years. We are united in full support. Thank you for moving this forward.\nSpeaker 1: And one other thing in the eighth District, I don't know if you remember the chief motel. It's still a vacant lot. We spent ten years working on getting that removed before I became the councilman over there. And it it just about wore all two to nothing.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you again. Thank you, Rex. Thank you, Mr. President. Next speaker, please. It evening, Robert. And distinctive council members. The president of Coolidge Triangle Neighborhood Association and the issue of human trafficking has been pervasive for a very long time.\nSpeaker 1: It's not unique only to Coolidge Triangle. If you represent the corridors of PCH, Anaheim, Long Beach Boulevard, we have the same mutual concerns. If you are by the Travelodge, if you take a look at, you know, men against human trafficking, the message is loud and clear.\nSpeaker 1: Their present, the different parts of our city. Thank you, Rex, for bringing this to the table. This is a long term concern that the residents have spoken about for a very long time. I think that in many, many years you've been the first to actually step up and address this issue.\nSpeaker 1: I hope that you as a council members do support Rex with this measure. The community deeply cares about our growth in many ways. We're very proactive in our community in ways that perhaps city funding cannot fund. We have leaders here who are both alumni from neighborhood leadership programs, have developed leaders in the community from tree plantings and\nSpeaker 1: corridor improvements. We want to continue improving our neighborhoods because we care deeply about those neighborhoods. If there's anything that you can do tonight is support Rex in his endeavors in improving North Long Beach and in your quarter two.\nSpeaker 1: And what we do look at at the end of the day as well, if somebody had mentioned Rex, you had mentioned the kids also have to see prostitution on their way to school, going on in cars, on their way to school, going through our neighborhoods and as many times as our residents call.\nSpeaker 1: And they keep on coming back. Where is the equity for these kids? So we as a community are going to continue being vocal. We as a community are continuously going to be fighting for what's right for our kids, our communities, our community as homeowners that are vested in this community.\nSpeaker 1: We look to your leadership and your support in the proposition that Rex is presenting. So I do. Thank you. Thank you so much. Good to see you again. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: We've always it's funny, right? I know. We all need to laugh.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor. Last year.\nSpeaker 2: Council members. Public in general. My name is Hilda Guyton. I am the co-chair of the Coalition for Katrina Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: And I'm here to support this item. I don't need to describe the atrocities that human.\nSpeaker 2: Trafficking brings to the people.\nSpeaker 4: Involved.\nSpeaker 2: And to the community as a whole. With all my respect.\nSpeaker 4: I urge you to please support this item and to help end the exploitation, especially of kids or children's children, and make.\nSpeaker 5: Our city and.\nSpeaker 2: Neighborhoods safer for all. Thank you very much. And thank you, Mr. Garcia, to bring this item to the table.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Next speaker. Next speaker, please. And that was very the time on. That was wonderful. Thank you. Said so much in 45 seconds. I loved it. My name is Dennis Patel, and I'm here with the Long Beach Hotel Motel Association.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, your honorable mayor. The Long Beach Council members and the staff. You are doing great work and we sincerely want to thank all of you for your service. I'm here this evening with our Long Beach Hotel Motel Association to give comments on the feasibility of a citywide nuisance motel ordinance that, for some unknown reason, is just\nSpeaker 1: applicable to motel and not hotel property owners. Today is the first time that we are all hearing about this ordinance through tonight's agenda. No one from the 14th floor has contacted us. Today we are just kindly asking for a 30 day continuance or extension during this 30 day continuance period.\nSpeaker 1: We would like to meet our council members to mutually discuss and understand the details of the ordinance. Today we contacted the Office of All Language City Council members. However, we haven't heard back from their office yet, as I understand that we had to send the the letter out at a short notice as well.\nSpeaker 1: Your honorable mayor and council members. We think it's very fair to all sides to allow a 30 day continuance to meet and put our thoughts together to come up with more acceptable situation. Please kindly allow us this opportunity to work with our council members.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next week, release. 3 million council members and mayor. My name is Roswell Lopez, and I am here on behalf of Ana Soto, who couldn't join us tonight. So she wrote a letter which I began to read.\nSpeaker 1: Dear City Council, my name is Ana Soto, and I'm and I'm a resident of the Ninth Council District. This letter is in lieu of my personally attending tonight's meeting to speak in support of your proposal to evaluate and expand short and long term solutions to address the nuisance motels.\nSpeaker 1: These specific motels have become a hub of illegal activity over the years, causing much blight and crime in the surrounding areas, most notably human trafficking. I work as an analyst for human trafficking. I work as an analyst and human trafficking coordinator for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\nSpeaker 1: But tonight, I speak as a resident who has much experience in the fight against human trafficking. I am a member of the Lambert Human Trafficking Task Force and see the devastation human trafficking is wreaking in our communities morally, financially and emotionally.\nSpeaker 1: I request the City Council support Vice Mayor Richardson's proposal. So Long Beach can continue its project towards a safe and caring city in the state of California. I make myself available to lend political, personal and community support towards a successful implementation of the short and long term solutions being proposed.\nSpeaker 1: Blessings Signed. ANAM Soto, Chair of the 63rd District, Los Angeles County Democratic Party. Thank you. Thank you very much. And thanks to Mrs. Soto as well. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, mayor. Council persons and allow me to speak today.\nSpeaker 1: My name is G2 Patel, 50 Atlantic Avenue, Long Beach. I'm not I was not aware of what you are considering today, especially as this will affect our livelihood. If it wasn't for the press telegram.\nSpeaker 4: I would have known that this item was being presented.\nSpeaker 1: Today. I think it's unfair to pass an item without the input from hoteliers. Hoteliers. We would like to review staff reports as well and to discuss the.\nSpeaker 4: Situation and how human trafficking is horrible. And I certainly don't allow that.\nSpeaker 1: Any of my properties. We just don't do that. It's not allowed and my.\nSpeaker 4: Staff is trained on that.\nSpeaker 1: Things and those things. My colleagues and I.\nSpeaker 4: Want to exchange ideas and to work together with you to figure.\nSpeaker 1: Out how to deal with this situation. Don't you have existing.\nSpeaker 4: Laws to deal with those two properties that are in your district, sir? Like sups or or licensing or something to to help you and then endeavor. I'm not sure why we keep.\nSpeaker 1: Adding more things. You use what you have. I want.\nSpeaker 4: To. I'm asking for your consideration. A 30 day continuation of.\nSpeaker 1: What we are going to consider tonight. I want to discuss our issue with the staff and our council people. Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Excuse me. I'm Robert Bergman. I am. Thank you for allowing me to speak here. I've been here working in Long Beach for ten years, and I've been in school here in Long Beach. I'm a graduate from Long Beach State.\nSpeaker 1: I'm also a U.S. veteran, disabled American. All right. This is about time we have something like this. Because this has been going on for a long, long time. And I want to be I'm I'm also the founder of a clean up Sapp area coalition.\nSpeaker 1: And if you didn't hear, the Grace Motel should be added to the list. And it also burned. It went up in flames. I say take it all down now. Take it away. Because it's nothing but a cesspool of drugs violence.\nSpeaker 1: And. Prostitution. All kinds of illegal activity goes in and out of there and not one of your police officers will go in and do anything about it. They take a blind eye to what is right.\nSpeaker 0: And.\nSpeaker 1: For the homeless population. The landlords. This should also be this should cover the landlords of apartment buildings as well, because they are too at fault. And for the homeless crisis. Have each landowner. Have a division of percentage of units available for homeless vets.\nSpeaker 1: Homeless? Anybody? Anybody. Homeless? There should be. A percentage of their apartments ready to rent to the homeless. Thank you for your service.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: That's your phone.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening.\nSpeaker 1: Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 8: Council members.\nSpeaker 1: City staff.\nSpeaker 8: I applaud the work you do. My name is Jimmy Murray. I'm president of the Start King Neighborhood Association. I reside at six, seven.\nSpeaker 1: Nine five Beachley Avenue.\nSpeaker 8: Been there for 40 years.\nSpeaker 1: This is my third stint as president.\nSpeaker 8: Of the Neighborhood Association. In that area, we have 1100 homes.\nSpeaker 1: But I want to say that I took the opportunity to stand with men standing against trafficking.\nSpeaker 8: On Long Beach Boulevard Friday night. It was an awesome opportunity to.\nSpeaker 1: Look at that.\nSpeaker 8: Strip.\nSpeaker 1: I drive.\nSpeaker 8: Past there five, six, seven times a month.\nSpeaker 1: And.\nSpeaker 8: Most of the hope motels.\nSpeaker 1: You wouldn't even know.\nSpeaker 8: They are there unless you happen to frequent them. There's only one multi-story motel in that little strip there. But I want to say this.\nSpeaker 1: Holding that sign up there, I could not help but.\nSpeaker 8: Cars with men coming to Victoria and then making a U-turn.\nSpeaker 1: And I thought.\nSpeaker 8: Did they see us with those signs? Were they out hunting and turned around and went the other way? That's what went through my mind. I said, get rid of those hotels, motels that are causing problems.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Jim. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, council members. My name is Virginia's Art and I'm a founding member of the Long Beach Human Trafficking Task Force. And as we were talking about the motels and as vice mayor, you were talking about their location and such.\nSpeaker 3: I remember before knowing anything about human trafficking, so many times you would ride down a street and you'd see a hotel, and in your mind you're thinking, this is kind of a strange place for a motel to be.\nSpeaker 3: It's not like it's in the center of anything, any kind of tourist area or anything like that.\nSpeaker 5: And I often.\nSpeaker 3: Wondered, how do these businesses stay in business? And then once I learned about human trafficking, it kind of raised a red flag for me that as you see these motels, they are actually used for exploitation for for the young for the young children, for men and women as well.\nSpeaker 3: But I don't want to insinuate that exploitation only happens in these motels. It doesn't it can really happen anywhere. But what is so hard to take is that it happens here in our own city. And as you hear the residents who live in the neighborhoods of these hotels and motels where all the crime is happening and all\nSpeaker 3: the calls for service, the numbers that you shared earlier were just outstanding. And to know that that happens in our city, just. Breaks my heart in so many ways and so many of our task force members are here to support.\nSpeaker 3: And we've been working on this issue for six years now and Long Beach, and we're here and we're ready to support you, and we appreciate you bringing this forward. I also wanted to.\nSpeaker 4: Comment that.\nSpeaker 3: One of our partners here was in court today with three young women who had actually been trafficked through motels. So it does happen in these motels. So thank you so much. I appreciate you bringing this forward.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much for having this discussion. My name is Patrick Erlandson and I work at the Long Beach Human Trafficking Task Force for a number of years on the prevention side of this issue. I'm also the head of the men's standing against trafficking, which you've heard about.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm also an English teacher and the father of two daughters, one of whom was approached by a recruiter for human trafficking when she was in high school. I really want to applaud Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this in, his consistency and really and really caring about this issue and bringing this to the forefront in the community\nSpeaker 1: , and especially for bringing this this forward. I think we can't arrest our way out of this problem. It's it's too big. And it requires the community to stand. It requires legislation and it requires law enforcement. I think we've been doing as men standing, it's trafficking.\nSpeaker 1: We take these signs and we take over an intersection once a month, the third Friday of each month, and demonstrate to to the victims of human trafficking that not all men are customers, that we care about them, that there's a better life for them.\nSpeaker 1: We stand to demonstrate to the men who are on their way to buy someone's body that there's something better, that actually this is life or death. This is actually not a victimless crime that Lynette Washington paid the price with her life in one of those hotels.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that we want to also send a message to the traffickers that they're seen and that this is not acceptable in our communities. We've been doing this at different intersections for over two years. We've been taking a stand.\nSpeaker 1: And when we moved to Victoria Street in Long Beach Boulevard, the response from the community was so profound, so strong and so wholehearted that it was just really it was such a moving experience. We had so many people turn out.\nSpeaker 1: Many of the people that are here today, people hug, people, stop it, grab signs from us. And they wanted to stand with us because they love their community. And I think what this proposal really means and what what Vice Mayor Richardson is proposing here, as well as the other council members, is that there's a vacuum, and that\nSpeaker 1: vacuum is being filled by pimps and traffickers. There are empty beds and those empty beds are being filled by somebody daughter, by somebody who's been victimized, by someone who's being exploited for someone else, for some slave master to make their money.\nSpeaker 1: And I think this vacuum, what this proposal does is it takes that vacuum there, takes the people the people who love their community. It takes their love for their community, their homes and their children. And it stuffs that vacuum and closes it.\nSpeaker 1: And I think this is really critical and really important that the community really stands, stands up and supports this proposal. One of the thing, as a teacher, kids always have these cute ways of texting their messages and things that are important to them, whether it's lol, which everyone knows.\nSpeaker 1: But there's one FOMO. I don't know if you remember that FOMO, but some kids use that and it's a fear of missing out. And it really struck me that that's really appropriate for this right now, that we should be afraid of missing out on the opportunity to do something about this problem that's gone on for years.\nSpeaker 1: And I think waiting 30 more days, how many how many more mornings do people have to wake up and find condoms in there? Thank you, sir. I mean, we're at one time. This is this is a chance for.\nSpeaker 6: The most vulnerable. Thank you. Nice to be with you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. My name is Alfred Hayes Senior. I'm the I live in North Long.\nSpeaker 1: Beach, right next door to the Luxury Inn. And I had moved out two years ago to housing.\nSpeaker 8: Use my home for homeless women and children.\nSpeaker 1: And I did that for two years and I spent my own money to help them.\nSpeaker 8: Get off the street. A couple of them went back to the street, but most of them got their life together and they went on to become productive members of the community. I moved back.\nSpeaker 1: January of 2016, but ever since I've moved.\nSpeaker 8: Back, I realized that my this area has.\nSpeaker 1: Gotten worse.\nSpeaker 8: Than when I had moved out. I've found people on top of my roof.\nSpeaker 1: Two nights ago, a guy was sitting in my yard, peering into my 13 year old girl's bedroom. It was a blessing to see them come.\nSpeaker 8: On the corner and try to to bring bring interest to this problem that's getting continuously worse. It has dragged the community down to total drug deals. My bills, my cars.\nSpeaker 1: My remote control have been hijacked. I've been I've been out watching my cars. They locked my car. They open my car. They put trackers on my. My vehicles. They broke in my house, put listening devices in my home.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm afraid that sometimes they hear me and my wife of 32 years and our most intimate moments.\nSpeaker 8: Do you really realize what's really happening here?\nSpeaker 1: This place.\nSpeaker 8: North Long Beach, the coolest part district has gone to.\nSpeaker 1: The docks. It has gone to the dogs. And I live there. I experience it. If you don't live there and have not experienced it, I'm telling you what has happened. Trackers on my car, listening devices in my home.\nSpeaker 1: They park in front of my home every day to walk around to the hotel to buy drugs. So I know I see it and I'm fed up with it. I was just on the verge of calling the FBI to make a report with them before I sing.\nSpeaker 1: Thank God, Rex, you know, do what they did on the corner. And I went out there and I held the sign with him. So just just to let you know.\nSpeaker 8: I'm really fed up with it.\nSpeaker 1: I put my life on the line to serve this country. I volunteered willingly to die for this country if need be. So I'm asking this city to stand up, to do something now for me. Give back to someone who put their life on the line for this country.\nSpeaker 1: Now, I have two children, twins. Now that's two. Just turned 13. My daughter. Two months ago in Lawrence, Kansas, we have the fastest time in the 400 meter, which was a 5712 in a 12 year old group. I'm trying to raise my children to be decent children in the city of Long Beach to bring a good life\nSpeaker 1: to this city.\nSpeaker 8: So, please, if you can do anything.\nSpeaker 1: Please don't wait 30 days.\nSpeaker 8: It's been too long. It's been years.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: But my name's Matt Houston. I just mentioned short term and long, long term solutions. But something that occurred to me is also a holistic approach that's important. Being from different parts of the country. Notice things are a little bit different here in L.A. County.\nSpeaker 1: One of the things that I've noticed is a lack of public restrooms. So one of the things that I've been trying to work on is an idea for for creating a company that all day that say all we do is as public restrooms and, you know, some of them self-cleaning, but then have access to Lifeline phones right\nSpeaker 1: there and maybe have some Lifeline phones with the apps built in right into it, right inside the hotels, you know, maybe have some, you know, touch screens, maybe figure out a way to use grant money to make sure that those are there.\nSpeaker 1: So people always have access, you know, find some people who have gotten out of the sex trade industry and maybe have them come together, create a nonprofit, private organization that creates a secure webcam, you know, for for girls that that want to do that stuff on online and make money whatever but not but do it in a\nSpeaker 1: safe way at least if that's if that's the way that's going to go, you know. And I mean, because people do that and a lot of a lot of sex trafficking ends up there, you know, and it ends up that, you know, people are sitting there watching and paying money online for people they don't realize are sex\nSpeaker 1: , sex slaves, stuff like that. So I think it's important to have security in those things as well. So the stick approach is important, but a care approach is important as well. So job placement opportunity, vocational aptitude test, maybe having one of the ideas I'm trying to toss around is having a separate kind of command structure for the\nSpeaker 1: sheriff's department. If I get if I get elected there and have a separate one with different leadership and have people that can volunteer one side or the other, but it's not so much aggressive enforcement, but, you know, completely different, you know, kind of like the Peace Corps versus Marine Corps type of thing.\nSpeaker 1: So you have you know, you can have some officers with crossover, but the leadership is different. And then you it opens up opportunities to be able to reach people that wouldn't come up to you in another capacity with a gun on the hip kind of thing, you know.\nSpeaker 1: And it creates, you know, if you have a sex slave in a pimp situation and then you have a different code and this command structure, then that might create some opportunities that aren't available right now. Also creating increasing communication, creating a special cable channel, marketing apps, outreach to the periphery of crime.\nSpeaker 1: Try to reach all the people that you can. Scholarships for new ideas reached out to the schools. How can we solve this from inside of schools? Different visa programs, you know, disrupt the, you know, the the networks of of the traffickers and that sort of thing.\nSpeaker 1: And even, you know, reach people on the periphery of that and pull them in and do some more on honest run work. And I just recommend against too much of a fortress mentality, some carrot, some stick, but in the right balance.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Houston. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Garcia. Vice Mayor Richardson. Council members. My name's Cam Patel. I'm here to represent my family. We owned the property at 1657. Atlantic Avenue. Was on the list settling in in the ninth District.\nSpeaker 1: We have had that property for about 30 years now. We've never had any accusations that we were a nuisance to the community we like. My management often attends the Uptown Business meetings, which is right across the street. We got a letter in November from the city staff pretty much blindsided by it.\nSpeaker 1: You know, we right away turned around and worked with Carl Wegman in the planning department with the city to address some of the concerns he had. We met with a Long Beach PD right away as well. I emailed him the next day that we got the letter and also gave him a few phone calls.\nSpeaker 1: So we want to work with the city, but also there needs to be a little bit more dialog. We felt like we just got this call called our in our hands and we were actually we haven't even seen a call log, so just a little bit of dialog going on.\nSpeaker 1: Giving us the opportunity to have a seat at the table is is a definitely a good thing and I just look forward to working with the city and the community. You know, we work with DPS to help people find a place to stay in between homes or even homeless people.\nSpeaker 1: So sometimes that give us a situation where some people have some mental health issues that can also cause an increase in call log activity. So to be sensitive to those things as well, I think is you need to have opening to an open mind as well.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you very much next week.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, City Council.\nSpeaker 5: My name is Dr..\nSpeaker 3: Johnny Rex O.D. and I'm a member. I'm actually vice president.\nSpeaker 4: Of the Forth Park Neighborhood Association, which is actually just across the river from the Coolidge Triangle and along with neighborhood associations that are most affected by the issue with human trafficking. And I'm in complete support of this agenda tonight.\nSpeaker 4: Agenda item tonight. We currently have an unacceptable situation occurring among many of the motels in my community along these boulevard. We have had several we have several daycares and two schools in the in the vicinity where our children are subject is not only see this activity back to be accosted and propositioned by traffickers, which is absolutely egregious\nSpeaker 4: and the situation has been allowed to fester for too long. So I implore the city to take the situation seriously and take the issue of crafting this ordinance seriously for the sake of the men, women and children being exploited every day in the community, face to force to have to endure it.\nSpeaker 4: Let us no longer be complicit by turning a blind eye to one of our most pressing modern day social ills. And with that, I say thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 7: Hello. Good evening again. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and our councilwoman strikes again. I have lived in North Long Beach for the past three years and again, we've been having problems. Oh, my. Not not until I think about two years.\nSpeaker 7: From that point on, we've been complaining to the police because we have a neighborhood watch, neighborhood association meetings. And the police, they always tell us, okay, when I should please call and report them. I've been doing that for months and months and months in a year, right where I live, we got to 2 to 3 schools.\nSpeaker 7: And again, parents are afraid to even enroll their children in there because they see all these prostitutes I'm sorry, all these people with very I could say the way they dress so provocative. And again, some of these kids that are walk to Colin Powers, they used to be walking in the mornings about two years about himself, but\nSpeaker 7: now they're accompanied by their parents because they're afraid of especially young girls showing young kids. They're afraid to leave them alone because, again, a well, they see the activity, they see the crime in the area. So again, when these gentlemen are saying that give us 30 days, we never heard about it.\nSpeaker 7: And I'm sorry, sir, but we never saw you there before. All of a sudden you're here because again, we're here. But we peaceful are newsletters once a month from the neighborhood association informing everybody about the crime in the area.\nSpeaker 7: These people never come to the meetings. There never were. We never have seen them coming to the meetings. We never have seen them. They don't even approach us to to see if they can improve the community. So there's the reason I'm here.\nSpeaker 7: So please, please. When you help.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks, speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Hi. My name is Ron at Mesa. I'm with the Hamilton Neighborhood Association. I'm a managing board member. Honorable Mayor Council members. Rex, I really I just want to thank you for.\nSpeaker 3: You know, bringing this to the attention and the awareness that you've brought.\nSpeaker 4: I had the honor of.\nSpeaker 3: Being at a demonstration.\nSpeaker 5: Last Friday with a number of.\nSpeaker 3: People here, men against sex trafficking. And there was a.\nSpeaker 5: Lot of community support, people giving.\nSpeaker 4: Us the thumbs up and honking. But there's also pimps that came.\nSpeaker 5: Out and threatened us and we had to cut our demonstration short. So that showed me and I guess I didn't.\nSpeaker 4: Understand that this problem is going on because I live in a in a couple.\nSpeaker 5: Of neighborhoods over. I do find used condoms and things on our streets. But I didn't.\nSpeaker 3: Realize that pimps.\nSpeaker 4: Would come out and threaten us and scare everybody off.\nSpeaker 5: I hope we do it again really soon. But I would have.\nSpeaker 4: To ask you guys as a group to ask the hotel owners that are saying they had.\nSpeaker 5: No idea this was going.\nSpeaker 4: On. Where are they? They have bad employees that aren't reporting.\nSpeaker 5: All these police, all this police activity, illegal activity that are going on in their.\nSpeaker 4: Hotels. They don't live around here.\nSpeaker 5: Because it's obvious what's happening. If you drive up and down the street or you live in the area.\nSpeaker 4: Or they just don't care or they're profiting from it. Yeah. And if they're profiting from it, so is.\nSpeaker 3: The hotel alliance that came out and spoke.\nSpeaker 5: Because I'm sure they're paying money to be in this group. And I just have to say, I didn't.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 3: Got very educated since Friday. I didn't know there was 14 year olds out there. I didn't know that 98% of these people in servitude were basically slaves.\nSpeaker 5: They have guns held to their head. They're scared. They can't get out of this situation. And these hotel owners are giving them a place to.\nSpeaker 4: Perpetuate these crimes. So thank you again for bringing this to the attention of everybody, Vice Mayor And thank you for the protection you're offering these young ladies and young men that are in these situations. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. Council member and mayor council members and Mayor Robert Garcia. My name is Renee Wheels and I'm a resident of the ninth District. I stand before you as an advocate for my community and a support for this motel ordinance.\nSpeaker 3: And thank you, Rex. I really appreciate this. And you took my 3 minutes, so I'm going to get this short. I just really.\nSpeaker 2: Want you guys to understand that between Long Beach Boulevard, between the 17 and new one, it's only a thousand steps for these children to take every day to go to school and come go home.\nSpeaker 3: Every day. It's a thousand steps.\nSpeaker 2: They are walking. They see the women.\nSpeaker 3: And the pimps waiting. So just.\nSpeaker 2: Imagine. Just take a moment for you guys, council members to take take a moment in your life when you're a.\nSpeaker 3: Child and you have this fear, these feelings of being uncomfortable and just the fear.\nSpeaker 2: Which is imagine you're a fifth grade student coming from Colin Powell walking down Amish Boulevard and he see a woman. What kind of feeling are they feeling now? They see a man standing by, just watching. What kind of feeling are they feeling?\nSpeaker 2: Then they have.\nSpeaker 3: Another time where they're walking and they're standing. There's a man following.\nSpeaker 2: Them home.\nSpeaker 3: And whispering in their ears.\nSpeaker 2: This has been done, as has happened to our students in Colin Powell.\nSpeaker 3: So please. This time's up on.\nSpeaker 2: Human trafficking and prostitution. But how many other how many more names do you want to add to hashtag MeToo?\nSpeaker 3: How many more names.\nSpeaker 2: So please support this ordinance. And thank you, Rex.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. And we have our last four speakers and they were closing our actual you'll be the last five speakers and the speakers list is closed. Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. My name is Clyde ASADA. I'm a member of the ninth district lifetime member. And this has been something that has just waited too long. How do I know? Because when I was a child, I was that child that Renee spoke.\nSpeaker 3: I was a child in the Longwood neighborhood. And that is exactly the experiences that that I, I encountered. I'm an adult now, and I see it. It continues. 30 years later, nothing has changed or very little has changed.\nSpeaker 3: If anything, it's getting worse. I remember when the luxury and was built as the Days, Days Inn Motel or Days Inn Inn Suites and you know, it was really shiny, pretty and new. And at that time we had we would have, you know, quinceaneras, weddings, whatever.\nSpeaker 3: And none of my family was going to stay there. Nobody was going to support these businesses as hotels are motels because we knew exactly what kind of activity was going on there. Now we have, you know, freshly painted luxury end, but it's still the same thing.\nSpeaker 3: You put a lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. So what we want to do is change the the policy change, change the use of it. What we need are restaurants, coffee shops, banks that is reflective of the neighborhoods that are immediately surrounding that strip.\nSpeaker 3: The Coolidge neighborhood in the Longwood neighborhood are not reflected by what is on the street. The businesses that are there do not reflect our interests. They reflect their pocketbook interests. So thank you for the time.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. That's bigger council members. My name is Peter McBride. I've been part of an organization that rescues girls that are being sex trafficked. Somebody said something about Snoop Dogg. I'd like to point out that he was a pimp.\nSpeaker 1: These pimps are taking these girls. They're they raped them several times. They beat them daily. That's that's just the beginning of what they do to these women. I could go into deep detail, which is not part of what's going on today, but this is the violence that's going on.\nSpeaker 1: And we all know that violence breeds violence. I pointed out I was at the stand over at East Croydon Street and Long Beach Boulevard Boulevard. And I was pointing out to the people, because I've been involved with the rescues.\nSpeaker 1: The extent of security that goes on there. I was pointing out how the security was walking around the different levels, how the security of the pimps, men were driving around. If you if you own that place or you work at that place and you can't see that type of security, then something's going on.\nSpeaker 1: You're missing out. Oh.\nSpeaker 8: For the police officers.\nSpeaker 1: Long Beach is setting the standard for handling human trafficking. They're setting the standards. So somebody is saying something about the police force here in Long Beach. You need to take a step back and regroup. And the problem that they're having with these hotels really needs to something needs to happen with the hotel.\nSpeaker 1: I'm not from Long Beach, but I've been down here with men stand against trafficking and you have a problem. And I appreciate what you're trying to do with that. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, the last three speakers.\nSpeaker 4: Hi, I'm Juanita Parrish. I'm a member of the Coolidge Triangle Neighborhood Association. I've met a lot of you. I was I had an opportunity to meet our mayor and of course, our vice mayor, Rex Richardson is my councilman.\nSpeaker 4: What I'd like to say, there are three things I'd like to address. One is every month we have our neighborhood association meeting. Every month we complain to the police department. We've had our chief of police come to our meetings, we've had our commander come to our meetings, we've had vice come to our meetings.\nSpeaker 4: And we've we regularly have officers come to our meeting. They give us updates. They're not the problem. The problem is the system. And we're trying to correct that system now and we're asking for your help. We can we can take a reactive approach to everything.\nSpeaker 4: Every time something happens, we react. But tonight we have an opportunity to take a proactive approach to something. All of you have an opportunity to take a proactive approach. And like the gentleman said, we become we become the the everyone looks to us as the example, just an example of set.\nSpeaker 4: I understand those three gentlemen from the motels. If tonight we were voting on something, it was becoming ironclad. They would have a right to say 30 days, but they don't have a right to say 30 days. All they want us to do is to put it on the back burner so that we have to come and try\nSpeaker 4: again. We're not making something ironclad. What we're saying is, after the pilot program, let's explore this, let's explore this. Let's change the laws. If they're not working, we've got to change them. So all we're asking you to do is to.\nSpeaker 1: Support.\nSpeaker 4: This program.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you very much. Next week, speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: I remember.\nSpeaker 1: Distinguished counsel. Thank you. My name's Dave San Jose. I was born in Long Beach Area Community Hospital in 1940. So I've seen the good, the bad, and I guess I'm seeing the ugly.\nSpeaker 0: In.\nSpeaker 1: The house. I live in North Long Beach. I've been there 40 years. I really love my home, I love my neighbors. I got some great neighbors and they all feel the same way about our community. I ran a youth center for 18 years as a volunteer in this city and probably for at least 15 of those years\nSpeaker 1: I had kids. Tell me about the motel, the luxury. They told me all the things went on in there and I had to deal with gang members. Your average everyday kid, boys and girls. I couldn't believe the stories they told me.\nSpeaker 8: I found them all come true.\nSpeaker 1: And the situation that's happening now, it's I just heard the other day is this teacher is going to teach a class. About how to walk home safely.\nSpeaker 8: I'm Colin Powell.\nSpeaker 1: In middle school. God, I never had a class like that when I was a kid. I mean, how many your kids have to do that? But these kids really have to do that because they walk by and through this situation.\nSpeaker 1: It's really gotten there. But you've heard all the horror stories. These are stories made up by this guy or that guy. This guy is their one day, get in your car and drive down lobby. Well, bar during these hours.\nSpeaker 1: I got a guy that goes to work at 4:00 in the morning and he sees trucker stop and pick up girls. They're. Another neighbor told me somebody else died in the hotel there somehow or another the other day they put flowers and candles there.\nSpeaker 1: We don't even know all the things that happened in there. There's always asking is, there's nine of you. Every one of you should pass this bill. There should be nine councilman here. I guess the mayor can't. Nobody should vote for two.\nSpeaker 1: But then when do people leave the city? Because you're only going to be here four years. Five years, whatever it happens to be. Are you going to leave the city better than you found it? Now you have an opportunity to do that because what these people are saying, what these people are feeling is real.\nSpeaker 1: Last week, 17 people got shot in Miami. Uh huh. Things like that are happening. This is real. We live in different times. We need to do something about it. You need to do it now. And don't worry. The kids are going to be alive for a while because they're taking a class.\nSpeaker 1: How to walk home. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. And our last speaker.\nSpeaker 0: Is a.\nSpeaker 1: Mayor.\nSpeaker 7: And council member.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Yogesh Patel. I own.\nSpeaker 8: Colonial motels, which is one of the listed property.\nSpeaker 1: I've been running the place for 37 years. I repeat 37 years. When I came to Long Beach in 1981.\nSpeaker 7: And only eighties, police used to do sting rings. Last 15 years. There is no such thing as ten years because the.\nSpeaker 1: Hostages are gone. Most of the complaint we heard from people on northside, i suggested you guys host September Stinger. These are the other thing. If you want to stop oh, stop renting rooms to people who don't have a place to go, where would they go?\nSpeaker 1: Do you want to have people living in huts, you know, Cambodia on.\nSpeaker 7: Pacific Coast Highway like we have in downtown Long Beach under a bed. So this is all we have to make.\nSpeaker 1: And as far as this clothes are concerned, I believe in the motels have a private security. We have private security. So I don't know where all these calls come from. If there a noise tick issue.\nSpeaker 8: If the.\nSpeaker 1: Boyfriend and girlfriend.\nSpeaker 8: Fight the call, the police.\nSpeaker 1: Are you going to hold us responsible for that?\nSpeaker 7: You know?\nSpeaker 1: If you think that's right? I don't think that's right. Also, we have a contract with the city. We work with the city to house the veterans. We are contracted mental health association. We work to help them. Now, if we did exist, where would these people go?\nSpeaker 1: It's our obligation to all walks of life to work together. And I'm urging you guys to come to the table and find a solution.\nSpeaker 8: And.\nSpeaker 1: Fix the problem rather than just building without, you know, getting what's real inside. So we are asking you to sit down and talk it out and solve the problem, not create more problems. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 1: Appreciate that. I want to go ahead and go back. We're going to go back to the council, have a couple a couple comments, and then I'm going to turn it back to the makers of the motion. First, I want to just thank everyone that came out.\nSpeaker 1: I think that particularly for the neighbors that came out, I know how important of an issue this is to all of you. I know how important this issue is to Vice Mayor Richardson. I think we spent about 15, 20 minutes this last weekend over a beverage talking about this very issue and how important this is to him\nSpeaker 1: to get this done for the community. For those that aren't familiar with the neighborhood. I think some someone said it earlier that the neighborhoods have it's a community of homeowners that whose community and homes are really beautiful and the neighborhood has well certainly has needs is a great collection of property owners that are working to improve their\nSpeaker 1: greater area. And so to say that one major boulevard isn't a good reflection of Coolidge or of the neighborhood is true. It isn't a good reflection. And I think that Long Beach Boulevard could be well, hopefully one day rise to the level of where the actual neighborhoods are.\nSpeaker 1: I think that's I think obviously a lot of the interest. I think it's important. You know, I appreciate that the owners of the of the motels that are here, I do think that data is important. And I think when data is presented by the police department, those are facts.\nSpeaker 1: And I think that we have to look at data and understand that the data is telling us something. And when calls are being made, it is the responsibility of the property owner, sir, to ensure that those issues are being mitigated.\nSpeaker 1: Now I want to ensure I want to make sure that as we move forward on this, I appreciate the vice mayor wanting to work and bring everyone to the table. I think that's responsible and obviously it's very appropriate.\nSpeaker 1: But I will say that I completely support the motion in front of us today and the and I know that we will adopt this tonight. I also want to just make sure, Mr. City Manager, that one thing was brought up tonight that was of interest to me is if if we are and if the city I understand\nSpeaker 1: that the city has a serious issue with homelessness. That is a statewide crisis, and I appreciate that. But I also want to ensure that when we work with property owners or motels or others in a partnership to house, that this is that looking at those contracts is part of this motion.\nSpeaker 1: If the vice mayor is is open to that because I'm I am not okay with regardless of who they are whether they're someone that's homeless or someone with a mental illness or a veteran. I want to ensure that we're also in there being placed in locations that are also safe and that are.\nSpeaker 8: That are appropriate.\nSpeaker 1: For for them. And so if the vice mayor's okay, if we can take take a look at the contracts and I'd be interested in any information back as to what what motels do we actually are under contract for for these services.\nSpeaker 1: And if they where they are and if they're actually on these lists and that would be just something for us, I think, to explore it as well. And and I will say also that what's impressive to me about this agenda item, besides all the work that went into it, which I know that the District 19 did, is\nSpeaker 1: there is actually the the the liquor store ordinance has had really great success. And it's really impressive to me that and listen, there's still a lot of bad liquor stores and particularly in the area where we first looked at the issue in the north.\nSpeaker 1: But there has been some real success stories out of that ordinance as well. And so I have a lot of hope for this. I would encourage staff to be very serious about the amortization program. I mean, that has worked in a lot of places.\nSpeaker 1: Now that we don't have redevelopment, think we need to be serious. I know there are legal hurdles and I think we need to be responsible about that as as a as a as a city. But I think that that should be looked at very seriously.\nSpeaker 1: And we should absolutely put in place an ordinance that looks at everything listed here. And and as we look at that and as a community engages if it needs to go beyond that and and look at ensuring that we have appropriate standards there for those that are also working there, that is within this council's preview purview as\nSpeaker 1: well. So I support this vice mayor, but most importantly to the community, you guys are doing a great job looking out for your neighborhood and for the city of Long Beach. So thank you and. And with that, we take it back to Councilmember Pearce and then Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mayor. And I definitely was going to follow up on many of the points that that the mayor made. I wanted to ask a couple of questions of staff. When police calls. Calls to service are done for these locations.\nSpeaker 5: How are the owners of these locations notified? And I know our police chief is not here, but I was wondering if anybody could answer that question.\nSpeaker 1: Will communicate that to the police department and get back to you as soon as possible.\nSpeaker 5: So it would be my request that as part of this program that the owners of any location where there are police calls, particularly hotels or motels that were I were mailing them a notification or reaching out to them.\nSpeaker 5: It's I could understand if an owner is not there operating it every day, their employees are dealing with it. Maybe there's a gap. Let's make sure there's not an excuse for saying that they didn't know these calls were being made.\nSpeaker 5: And so I would hope to see that.\nSpeaker 1: Understood.\nSpeaker 5: My other comment is in regards to, you know, the fact that we do use vouchers for some of these places and we do have standards in our continuum of care that might not be reflected in the contracts that we have with our health department.\nSpeaker 5: And so I'm curious, I know that we've been doing work for about a year on trauma informed care, and I know that we're about to do even more work on that and making sure that any location where we have a contract that might be out of the norm, that there be some part of trauma informed care or\nSpeaker 5: not trauma informed care, but trauma informed lens that not only would they be able to identify human trafficking, but also if it was a boyfriend and girlfriend that were having a fight. What's the best way to deal with that?\nSpeaker 5: How do you reach out to PD and not assuming that everybody that works in one of these motels might know best practices, but that if we are having a contract with them, we need to make sure that that's the bare minimum that we're doing.\nSpeaker 1: We'll make sure we engage health department in that. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. And then just recap one more time and making sure that the, you know, exploring transitional housing options after amortization in funds with the county is included as well. So thank you and thank you, everybody, for your passion and your commitment.\nSpeaker 5: I definitely got goosebumps a few times while you guys were talking and it hits home. And that's not often that we have a council meeting with something that could be so visceral. If you actually, while we're talking logistics about a program, knowing that this ruins lives not only for the individuals that are being trafficked, for those dealing\nSpeaker 5: with them, for their family that miss them. And so thank you so very much for caring and thank you so much to this council for taking the leadership.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So, first of all, Mayor, I want to thank you for your strong support on this item. I think that message came across really clearly, all the council members who spoke. Thank you so much for those comments.\nSpeaker 6: I just want to just acknowledge a few things. So, first of all, thanks for having the courage to share your stories. A lot of people may not believe believe some of that stuff, but the truth is, you were being modest.\nSpeaker 6: You were being very modest. I was there Friday when someone said a pimp rolled up and threatened us. I was there. Right. I think I think if people did see that experience or see what you're dealing with, I think we would have a lot more support publicly around this issue.\nSpeaker 6: This is a you know, I have to say this. You know, there's been a lot of meetings organizing. I have to acknowledge that you, the neighbors, we've done maybe five meetings in the last few months, specifically on this issue, in addition to the neighborhood association meetings that meet monthly.\nSpeaker 6: So this is this is sort of community empowerment. And it's best you stepped up, made this issue a priority. City Council acknowledges it. Right. We're going to cast a vote and set ourselves on course to hopefully fix this issue because frankly is fixable.\nSpeaker 6: It is fixed, but we can't fix every we can be on the right side of the human trafficking argument. We can't fix human trafficking forever and everywhere in the short term, but we can't fix Long Beach Boulevard. We know where they're rooted and the data justifies it.\nSpeaker 6: So I just want to want to want to acknowledge that to the city council. I want to thank you for your indulgence. You know, sometimes there are issues that mean, you know, I have no doubt that the city council acknowledges and values.\nSpeaker 6: When a resident steps up and says, this is important, we do it all the time. When issues come up, I may not be able to personally commit to it or understand it, but I take a step back because I know that that's 100% true to that council member in their district and it's 100% true to the people\nSpeaker 6: that are there. So thank you for that indulgence. These are the moments that these residents are never going to forget. When the city council listened to them and heard them out because they felt ignored for a long time.\nSpeaker 6: So whether you hear me or not, I acknowledge I acknowledge you guys indulging. And I really thank you for that. So the final thing I say is, you know, I have no doubt that we're going to get where we need to get to.\nSpeaker 6: We have to remain vigilant, continue to have meetings. But I have no doubt that there is light at the end of the tunnel on this issue. There are policy changes that can make a difference. So thank you all again and again.\nSpeaker 6: Encourage City Council support.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. With and with that, there's a there's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 2: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you all for. Thank you all for coming out. Thank you. We we will go back to the item on on parks and so per the the other motion. Thank you, guys. Thank you, Dave. Yeah. Thank you.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Next item.\nSpeaker 1: Item 23. Communication from Councilman Austin. Councilman Urunga. Recommendation to direct City Manager to delay any action regarding requests for an international customs facility at the Long Beach Airport until receiving further direction from the city council and until 90 days after the representation on the city council is completed.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, thank you. I'm going to turn this over now to Councilmember Austin.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank my colleague, Councilmember Urunga, for cosigning on this item. He is a true champion for our neighborhoods here in Long Beach. I want to start out and I want to be very clear that this agenda item does not address the merits of building the customs facility at the Long Beach\nSpeaker 11: Airport. Surely we will have that conversation at some point, possibly in the future. However. But I am troubled. For more than two years. JetBlue and Long Beach Airport officials have had early discussions and have been discussing a federal inspection services and a customs facility.\nSpeaker 11: We've just learned that there have been a lot of movement. There's been a lot of movement, resources and staff time committed to this issue. With no direction whatsoever from the city council. There are even discussions with the Department of Homeland Security and financial feasibility studies prepared.\nSpeaker 11: And objections from the City Council. How much of this effort? More than a year ago. Now we have a formal request from JetBlue for the city to submit an application for customs facility. And it makes sense for us to cool the jets, slow down on this very sensitive issue.\nSpeaker 11: Actually, tonight is the first time this issue is even being publicly discussed by the council, let alone we take a vote. So what are we seeking to do here before the city manager takes direction from the City Council on how to proceed with this request?\nSpeaker 11: There should be full representation on the City Council. Now, just to put it in perspective, I don't think we would have moved forward on a Belmont pool project had there been no council representative in the third District most recently.\nSpeaker 11: And I'm sure there would have been serious objections with moving forward with the Civic Center project if there were no representative from the Second District or the First District at the time. And we certainly don't want to move forward with a medical marijuana policy that oversaturate the ninth District if the ninth District doesn't have a council representative\nSpeaker 11: there either. Many residents who live in a fourth district live directly under the flight path of the airport. And I believe it's undemocratic to move forward with this issue in any way when such a key district does not have a voice or vote on the city council.\nSpeaker 11: We must also give time for that representative who will be elected in just over a month to get time to have time to be brought up to speed. There's a lot that comes at you when you're a brand new city council member.\nSpeaker 11: And for that fact, I think we held up a lot of business for the city to allow five new city council members to get seated and to get their feet underneath them so that they could get caught up on the issues.\nSpeaker 11: I think we all the same consideration for this new new councilmember coming in. For anyone who may disagree with me tonight recommended action. I'm sorry. I simply ask, what is the rush and whose timetable are we working under?\nSpeaker 11: The request was made for the city council and the city to move forward. And so we are driving this process. Not any company, not any airline in the spirit of decency and fairness to more than 500,000 residents in our city who do not have a seat behind this dais tonight, it is only right to delay this action\nSpeaker 11: or any action or considering this request for a few months. All three candidates from the fourth District seat have asked the city council in writing to delay this issue until 90 days after this seat is filled. One of these three candidates will soon be our colleague on the council.\nSpeaker 11: We even have a letter here from former councilmember in the fourth District and now state assembly member Patrick O'Donnell requesting the same and supporting this agenda item here today as well. As is often the case, I fully expect there will be efforts this evening to offer friendly amendments and substitutes and substitute substitutes.\nSpeaker 11: And I just want to be very, very clear. The JetBlue's lobbyists and the JetBlue folks have been very active in contacting our city council members and asking for this timetable to be minimized. Let me state that I consider that any proposal that fails to recognize the need for a voice from the fourth District residents before any action\nSpeaker 11: is taken by our city manager or staff would not be viewed as a friendly amendment. It runs counter to the intent to have a democratic process on this issue. This is an issue that can impact thousands of residents throughout our city.\nSpeaker 11: And so let's make sure that all the Long Beach has a voice. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Isom. Yeah. Customer your income.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mayor. I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague from the eighth District. This is a too important topic to not have a full council on. So I too, I support the motion by my my council colleague to delay this action until there is a full, full city council on board.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Think it comes from rearing someone to move on. I do have some speakers that we're going to go to. Of course, we have public comment, so we're going to go to have we have some I think there are some questions and speakers first and then we'll get to public comment, then we'll go back to the Council\nSpeaker 0: for deliberation. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I may have missed this. Was there a motion?\nSpeaker 0: There was not. Whether I believe that I may see a motion plugged in and think he said it, but he plugged into the system.\nSpeaker 8: So I'm sorry. I'm not even looking at the system. I apologize. Yes, there was a motion.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, we have a motion in a second. Austin uranium.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. I do have a few questions. And the first question I have is and most people don't need this, but just just for my own edification. Mr. City Attorney, if if you could just summarize perhaps what the distinction here is between this issue that we're taking up and the conversation that we're having and the concerns that a\nSpeaker 8: lot of people have, and rightly so, the concerns that people have about the noise bucket and and whether this actually impacts or any action such as this would impact that.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor, members of the council. Just to reiterate what was discussed at the study session on the airport there, the noise ordinance is not technically implicated by where the flights originate from or to. It is a cumulative accumulation of the noise created by the jets landing and taking off.\nSpeaker 4: So it is not related to or tied to this item before you this evening.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. And then. For the city manager so that those of us who aren't privy to all of the work that you're doing or even the conversations that council may have had in previous council meetings, if this motion if this item had not been before us, what was the work that you would have done or what is\nSpeaker 8: the work you would have done? What's the process you would have taken? Could you describe that for us?\nSpeaker 5: Vice Mayor Council Members We would then begin, probably hire a consultant and go through a study to look at the financial feasibility of this, look at the geographic feasibility, look at how it fits operationally, administration. And then probably in about five months, in July or August, we would come back to the city council for the city council\nSpeaker 5: to set policy.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Thank you. That's all I have right now, Mr. Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And except Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 12: I just wanted to make a statement about how I feel about my responsibility as a council person and how it differs from the letter written by a colleague that I respect and admire greatly. While I am elected by the members of the Fifth District, I think that each and every one of us have taken an oath of\nSpeaker 12: office to represent each and every person in this city, and that visits the city. And so when people come up to me and ask if I'm their council person, I say, of course, because I, I vote on $3 billion in budgets annually and the future and contracts related to millions of dollars in vendors, the pensions and benefits\nSpeaker 12: of hundreds of police officers, firefighters and public service workers and each and every one of those items is of importance to me. Specifically, I think that we as a council owe both our residents and our businesses a process this weekend while spending an additional amount of time in the fourth District, the place where I get my dry\nSpeaker 12: cleaning done, and my favorite frozen yogurt shop, which I spent a bit of time at. Residents often approach me and ask, Can you help with this? Can you help with that? Of course, because we as a council represent each and every one of you.\nSpeaker 12: While as a district representative, I take the lead on certain things related to cups or business licenses. That doesn't mean that my colleagues at any time would not vote for residents if they felt that I was not doing my diligence as a council member for the city.\nSpeaker 12: And so one of the challenges I have with the letter is it implies that the Fourth District is not represented, and I want each and every one of you to know that you are represented. I have lived in the flight path in two different locations.\nSpeaker 12: I have a multitude of family members who currently live in the flight path, as I've mentioned before. Every few months I remember as a child watching the screens from the windows and the soot on the cars from living in the flight path.\nSpeaker 12: And my parrot. My grandparents bought that land when the airport was just a little speck in people's eyes. And so he built that home that we lived in and. The difference can be, too, that often we buy our homes knowing and understanding the things that are there and the protections that are in place.\nSpeaker 12: And we need to balance that with ensuring that every business has the right to bring forward a request to this council and to be considered timely. I may not agree with some of the items before this council, whether it's the marijuana ordinance or the logic labor agreement or any other item.\nSpeaker 12: But the constituents are represented and every business is given that due diligence and the way that I currently read the memo from the city manager. This is a three year process. A delay of an additional three weeks is pandering.\nSpeaker 12: To this crowd because it's it's insignificant in a three year plan, which will take an exuberant amount of time. And so those that's my perspective. There is no way that our city staff would be able to bring back the information until the time at which our council members.\nSpeaker 12: Our new council member colleague will be seated. I have great respect for the three colleagues. I moderated their debate earlier this week. I think any of them would be able to digest this information. They seemed very informed on the matter in front of the public that was there then.\nSpeaker 12: And I have confidence in their abilities now and then. So with that being said, I have no more comments.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I have a couple questions for staff. First, I want to say that. I understand where Councilman Austin is coming from. I've talked with him about this issue. I know he's very concerned, as are all the council members.\nSpeaker 6: But he has he represents a constituency that we don't all represent. He has his own unique constituency and issues. And I've spent a lot of time talking to him about his concerns. And I do believe him when he says that this item is not about the merits of the proposal, but rather allowing us to be in a\nSpeaker 6: place where we have representation. And I think there's some validity there. And while I didn't think about that on this issue, I will say that this council has before it another very important issue, and that's the medical marijuana ordinance.\nSpeaker 6: And it's interesting to me, because the fourth District has a series of businesses that were negatively impacted by illegal medical marijuana dispensaries. They feel very passionately about that subject. And yet the current timeline that the council has in place for making a vote on that doesn't even include the fourth District representative being elected.\nSpeaker 6: And so I think there is a lot of merit to the idea of having representation from all of the districts, because although Councilwoman Mango may have her finger on the pulse of the Fourth District residents, I certainly don't.\nSpeaker 6: I represent the entire city, but my day to day obligation is to the residents of my district. So I think their councilperson would be in the best position to know what it is their constituents feel, and I think they would take that very seriously.\nSpeaker 6: So I think there's a lot of merit there. I also like and I hadn't heard it before, but the analogy to some of the big things that we voted on recently, we would not think for a moment about voting on the pool or the shot create issue if there was not a third district council person in the\nSpeaker 6: seat, because those are issues that heavily impact my district. So I think there I think he has some great merits on it, but I do have some questions for staff in regards to this process, and it's mostly just to educate myself on the process.\nSpeaker 6: So is there any work that the staff has to do before we vote, before we move forward with JetBlue's request, before we can actually move forward with JetBlue's request?\nSpeaker 5: Councilmember Mayor, first off, I'd like to make a comment that our airport director, Bryant Francis, had a long standing commitment outside the city. So he's not here tonight. We have our financial bureau manager, Claudia Lewis, with us to answer any specific questions.\nSpeaker 5: But this is a pretty general once I'll answer it. Basically, in order for us to go approach the federal customs facility, we would have to do our own study and get our own request from the city council. Whether the council views, whether this is a good idea or a bad idea to send an application forward.\nSpeaker 5: But we would need, like I said, about a five month time period to conduct a study, bring it to the council, and the council would take the next step.\nSpeaker 6: Now, would you need any direction from council to actually undertake that process.\nSpeaker 5: Given the item that we have tonight? I certainly would request direction. Yes. Absent this meeting, we would probably just process it.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Okay. And in regards to this particular item, I would like to ask the maker of this motion. Council member Austin and your. Would you be open to a friendly amendment to move the time period to 60 days after the person is seated to give them the opportunity to get caught up?\nSpeaker 6: Because I do agree with some of the points that have been made that I think we should wait. However, given the relevance of this topic and how frequently it's been coming up during the campaign trail, I expect that our future colleague will be very well versed on this issue.\nSpeaker 6: So I'm just wondering if you're open to that.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Austin.\nSpeaker 11: Well, I can tell you that when Councilmember Urunga and I first had this conversation early Monday morning before we could put our agenda item in last week, we we were fully aware that, that, you know, our 90 day, um, ask could be be seen as a little ambitious considering the fact that we have 30 days before we're\nSpeaker 11: 30 days out from an election and then possibly 60 days or even more after that. The 90 days was an arbitrary number to give us some cushion. I personally would would would I would be okay to a friendly amendment for 60 days, but nothing less.\nSpeaker 11: And if I knew that that I could get full council support on this on that I don't I don't want to. Undermine the importance of of delaying this and giving the fourth District Council member, the new council member coming in all of the room possible to to to be fully brought up to speed.\nSpeaker 11: And when I say fully brought up to speed, they have to step up in office. They have to figure out a mechanism to outreach and bid and get community support or to have a town hall meeting with their their constituents on this.\nSpeaker 11: And so when we do the 90 days out there, we thought that was fair. But, you know, if I'd be open if I thought that there was some if we can get some consensus as a council on this.\nSpeaker 6: And that's where I'm coming from. Council member Austin is I'm trying to find if there's a way that we can meet in the middle and effectuate the intent of, of this agenda item. You know, one thing I didn't mention carries a lot of weight with me is our former colleague, Assemblyman O'Donnell's letter.\nSpeaker 6: That carries a lot of weight with me because I don't think there is a single council member that I've studied in history that had his finger on the pulse of his community as well as Council Councilman O'Donnell did.\nSpeaker 6: And he is telling us from Sacramento, my constituents need to be heard. They need someone advocating for them specifically. That carries a lot of weight with me. I wasn't expecting to see this letter when I walked in tonight.\nSpeaker 6: I knew what your position was and certainly was sensitive to that. But I think to me, this this letter says a lot because he's the closest thing to a representative that they have right now. So, anyway, I appreciate you accepting that.\nSpeaker 6: Now, what about. Okay, I'm just going to stop there. Thanks for now.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Counselor Richardson.\nSpeaker 10: Thanks, Mr. Mayor. So just a couple of things. And, you know, I have my iPad up and I intentionally pulled up my my favorite game video game because I really didn't want to get into this conversation. But I think I'm going to jump in.\nSpeaker 10: So I would say that I'm serious. I got Star Wars. So I would say that, you know. This is a neighborhoods issue, the ninth District, not in the flight path, but they're on our neighbors flight path. Right. It's important to my neighbors.\nSpeaker 10: It's important to me. It's that simple. I think what's being asked for is is reasonable. But I'm lacking a whole bunch of context in terms of in terms of like I'm not I'm not entirely clear that we would be debating this issue at the city council within the next 120 days or 90 days after the election anyway\nSpeaker 10: . I would need to just hear from the city manager. Like, when were you planning on bringing this to the council? Are we talking about this because this agenda item was placed on and we wouldn't have been talking about this otherwise.\nSpeaker 5: Councilor, mayor, council members. We'd been discussing with the city council privately, but also more importantly with JetBlue that we weren't going to accept any application for a Customs facility until we had a new airport manager, airport director in the seat and established.\nSpeaker 5: So basically we were getting ready to process that because Brian Francis had been there for has been here for enough time to initiate a study. Then given the interest in the city council and neighborhood, it's here before the city council.\nSpeaker 5: So we certainly at this stage would request if we if we went forward, we would want city council direction.\nSpeaker 10: I guess my question is when if this item hadn't been brought, what was your plan to bring to bring this discussion to the city council? See if we were interested.\nSpeaker 5: The Council would know that we're initiated it. But but the first time the council would see.\nSpeaker 4: The plan would be when the study was complete, probably.\nSpeaker 5: In July or August.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. So in in how you develop your plan. Are there? Is this just an inward analysis that you and all your airport staff do? Or do you have to do outward communication to customs or federal agencies or anyone else to express interest in the airport?\nSpeaker 5: I believe it's more internally, but that's.\nSpeaker 4: A question I'm going to refer.\nSpeaker 5: To Claudia Lewis.\nSpeaker 8: So if I understand.\nSpeaker 12: Correctly, the question.\nSpeaker 8: Is what type of outreach would we do?\nSpeaker 10: Is is the study the study you're doing, are you expressing to the public or to other agencies that might have some scope, some sphere of influence on this decision? Are you expressed are you communicating with them about the study or is this something you can conduct in-house?\nSpeaker 12: So to be clear, there's there's no study going on right now.\nSpeaker 8: However.\nSpeaker 12: The the study would be done likely by an expert in the field.\nSpeaker 8: Who would look to.\nSpeaker 12: Other similarly situated airports bring in. Information regarding Customs and Border Protection and what the requirements there would be. So.\nSpeaker 10: So there would be outgoing. We would consult with those agencies to figure out.\nSpeaker 12: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 10: And that consultation, that process, does that cost money?\nSpeaker 12: Ordering the study would cost money.\nSpeaker 10: As had it been appropriate. Is there a budget for this?\nSpeaker 5: We would work within the airport.\nSpeaker 4: Parameters with their enterprise fund to do that.\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 10: I would I would just say and I don't have any motions or any substitutes or any friendlies, I would just say this, I'm not in any rush to jump into this discussion. I'd like to have an understanding of like what's out there.\nSpeaker 10: If that means city staff do their internal due diligence without necessarily particularly expressing to customs or someone else that we're interested. I think I'd like to say I have the facts. I think what my colleague is is asked for in terms of allow the council to be full.\nSpeaker 10: I'm not sure if that would have happened any way before we had it, but I think it's a fair question to ask. I you know, I agree. I wouldn't want this type of discussion take place if I wasn't on the city council or someone with the ninth District wasn't in it.\nSpeaker 10: But I would say that I don't necessarily agree that the rest of the council would necessarily put on a medical marijuana in district or wasn't someone to sit in there. But that's just my own personal opinion. But but.\nSpeaker 10: But here's what I would say. Like. I want to get out of the signs and the jargon and the politics and see the facts. So if you do what, no matter what happens tonight, I want to see. I would want to see, like the facts from city staff, whatever analysis internally.\nSpeaker 10: I don't want you to communicate out to other agencies. I wouldn't want you to express that we're interested, but have the facts. So when the fourth district is seated, we're not having another conversation because so far this is us.\nSpeaker 10: We had a study session, we couldn't talk about this issue and now we're having a second council item tonight where there's no facts on the issue. When it comes back again, when the fourth District is seated, I don't want to be in a place where there's no facts.\nSpeaker 10: So I guess my question is, is there a clear line, a distinct line between conducting a full study that engages customs and expresses our interest and a study that we can do internally to tell us the bottom line facts about the thing, the issues that folks care about.\nSpeaker 10: But that's my question.\nSpeaker 5: Councilman, if I could answer that, first off, I want to make it clear that any study that we did would not go to Customs and express an interest in this. This would just be a fact finding study when the council reviews it, it would not come with a recommendation.\nSpeaker 5: It would not say do this, or it could easily disappear in 30 days.\nSpeaker 4: If we find out it was financially feasible, then we would just stop and inform the council that we can't do this.\nSpeaker 5: But if it was financially feasible, we would continue it. But it would come to the council without a recommendation. It would merely say this is feasible. Does the city council want to take the next step? And the next step would then be to express an interest in this.\nSpeaker 5: We would not be expressing an interest through the study. The study would be fact finding. I also want to point out that what you're asking for, for staff to do an internal fact finding thing, we would not be able to do that.\nSpeaker 5: We couldn't meet your needs and that that's why we would have to go to an outside expert so we.\nSpeaker 4: Would not be.\nSpeaker 5: Able to to meet your needs in producing some type of an internal report that we can get to you.\nSpeaker 4: Without going to an outside consultant and taking the four or five months.\nSpeaker 10: I understand. So if this. So what would happen if this motion moves forward? Then after the fourth District councilperson was seated, then you would come back to City Council for permission to go out and do a study. Or you would wait until the 190 day or 120 days?\nSpeaker 5: We would we would wait to what the motion says, and I'll look to the city attorney. But if the motion says 60 days after the council member is seated, the study begins, we would keep this on a shelf.\nSpeaker 5: And in 60 days after the councilman receded, we would begin the study. If we got that direction, if the council said, if the motion said, come back to us in 60 days to see if we want to do it, we would do that.\nSpeaker 5: So it depends on what the motion reads from the city council. But again, at that 60 day point that the five month trigger would start, it would not start now. It would start 60 days after the member was seated.\nSpeaker 10: I get it. So really the question is, do you start your study now or do you start your study? Do you start your study essentially now based on direction or do you start the study three months after the fourth?\nSpeaker 10: This person is seated. Two months. Forgive me that that's the question. I mean, that's essentially the options that the council has today. That's a question.\nSpeaker 5: That's for the council to decide. We will respond to whatever, I guess.\nSpeaker 0: I think I think they're a quick point of information.\nSpeaker 11: And it was a report of information, as I mentioned in my opening comments. First of all, this this this agenda item request that that no action delay any action regarding the request until receiving further direction from the city council and and originally stated 90 days after a city council member from the fourth District received it.\nSpeaker 11: And I also want to raise the point that there was the airport did undergo a feasibility study. And there are facts laid out in that feasibility study for this council to consider it in point before that as well.\nSpeaker 0: Can we go back to the speakers list? What I'm going to do is I have a lot of people queuing up from before, so I'm gonna go to Mr. Andrews and then going go to this to the public, and then we'll go back to the council unless there's any objection from those are queued up.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Unless you want to go for the public is up to you.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no, that would be too late.\nSpeaker 0: I go first.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Go now.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. Andrews?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, by all means, yes. I also. I and you know, Councilman Austin, I really, truly understand, you know, your concerns and your compassion. You know, about this item. But I mean, we all have responsibilities to our constituents. You know, I believe that we need to begin the process of gathering information because the city has never been harmed\nSpeaker 2: by having too much information. You know, it's information that we need. And I've heard a lot of speculation, but no facts. And I would like to hear what the city manager, the city attorney airport and JetBlue has to say.\nSpeaker 2: Even though getting this report would probably get back to this probably after 90 days, 90 days, but I'm willing to go along, you know, starting the process after 60. You know, that's a friendly amendment. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Now we're going to go over to the public and we're going to go back to the council. So, again, 3 minutes, please, everyone, just come forward. If you come forward, if you can just begin to line up at the podium and just make sure you give your name and address and we'll go from please come forward\nSpeaker 0: . How are you doing?\nSpeaker 5: Good. My name is Greg HERWICK at 2024. I am in the fourth District. I am not represented. I was very happy to hear about Pat O'Donnell's letter showing up. Thank you so much for being happy about it. We're happy about it because we are not represented.\nSpeaker 5: Pat was really tight within our community and pretty much everybody knew him as with or without the airport issue personally and for the people that live in my community. We don't need an international airport. LAX is not that far.\nSpeaker 5: Orange County is not that far. It's ridiculous that we would want to have bigger flights, noisier flights come into our community. It doesn't make any sense. Has anybody in the city council I know there's some new people here.\nSpeaker 5: Is anybody heard of the Triangle of Death? That's what Long Beach has basically been represented as this. More flights, more noise, more pollution coming through the middle of the Triangle of Death. That's basically how Long Beach is looked at.\nSpeaker 5: They long they line up from the pyramid, come over public schools. It's not about necessarily the noise or the number of flights. It's about the pollution. It's about how it affects our kids. The noise bucket, in my personal opinion, is a joke.\nSpeaker 5: If you live in the flight path or if you live on the take off or, you know, we're more on the landing side, it's it's it's a joke to the, you know, to the people in the community, the 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. flights.\nSpeaker 5: That's a joke as well. They they break that all the time. We had flights taken off at five, six, 7 a.m. on a regular basis. There is nothing that controls this airport. And all you're going to do is make it bigger and get it more out of control for the people that live in the flight paths.\nSpeaker 5: That's it. I appreciate you putting on the snow day and picking up that slack from Pat O'Donnell and you guys coming out. But we need to be.\nSpeaker 4: Represented and before anything goes on, we.\nSpeaker 5: Need to be represented.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next week, a police.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, Honorable Mayor Council members. My name is John Deeds. I reside at 3600 Pacific Avenue. I have lived there for going on 45 years. But for the first 27 years of my life, I had a Naples home address.\nSpeaker 5: And just want to inject a little historic fact here. The last time that a recall effort qualified to go to a ballot. Was directed at my father, the third district councilperson and Tom Clark. And it was over there supporting.\nSpeaker 5: Jet service at Long Beach Airport. And with that, I will ask that you support Councilman Austin's motion. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening. My name is Josephine Long.\nSpeaker 12: I've been a homeowner in the seventh District for about 25 years, and I opposed the international flight from the JetBlue Airlines.\nSpeaker 7: I love JetBlue. And as I look, I try to travel to them as much as possible.\nSpeaker 12: But as far as the international flights, I think they would only, as they previously said.\nSpeaker 7: More noise, more deaths, more traffic.\nSpeaker 12: More everything. That's not good for Long Beach. In L.A.X. is less than 30 minutes away. And so there's no problem going to there or any of the other airports that have the international flights. But I think the homeowners that live in in Long Beach, as I said, they don't agree with the fact that they do fly earlier\nSpeaker 12: and later. They note it and it's an inconvenience for the homeowners there. So I ask you to take it into consideration and please do not allow them to have the international flights. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. And because the city attorney will consistently remind me and remind us, I just want as a reminder, the item before us is on the argument about the motion on the floor, which is to postpone any action until after the fourth District person is seated.\nSpeaker 0: So we want to make sure that we're keeping the the comments to that action. Thank you, sir.\nSpeaker 4: John Dilatory addresses on file. Honorable Mayor, City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. Everyone says, including everybody up there, that they will support and defend the Long Beach Noise Ordinance. The fact is, Long Beach has never successfully defended our airport noise ordinances.\nSpeaker 4: Our first ordinance adopted by the City Council in 1981 allowed a maximum of 15 daily flights. In 1983, 14, airlines challenged our ordinance in court. That federal district court determined that there were there was insufficient basis to support the 15 and up to to 18 1986.\nSpeaker 4: The City of Long Beach adopted an ordinance to limit the number of commercial carriers to 32. 1989, the ninth District Court invalidated the 1986 ordinance and ordered an increase to 41 per day that we have today. In 2000, two American Airlines challenged our slot distribution and alluded to their assault on our noise ordinance.\nSpeaker 4: If an agreement had not been reached with JetBlue to relinquish four slots to American, the paperwork was ready to file against the city. Mary Garcia City Manager. Patrick West. This direction to postpone any further discussion on allowing JetBlue a Customs facility should also apply to you and your staff.\nSpeaker 4: City management, no doubt under the guidance of Mayor Foster and now you. Garcia has moved this project forward behind closed doors since 2013. There are if you actually take a look, there are studies looking at this that says this is not really that feasible financially for us.\nSpeaker 4: That was done in 2013. Working in the dark without any public participation. And transparency is not why you were elected to serve as mayor. Please wait for the fourth District Council person to be elected. Then let's have an open discussion to see if it's even worth pursuing an international airport.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 9: Dennis Dunne, a staff update. I beg your indulgence for 10 seconds. I was presented with this document with what I was required to get. However, this is not enough. The map with the districts, the phone numbers should be enlarged and put in the library.\nSpeaker 9: It put it in the lobby, not on a table.\nSpeaker 0: Forgotten it. Thank you, Mr. Dunn. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: David Lewis, 840 West, 28/7 District. Last week, I was at a friend's house down in Orange County. Disney fireworks went off. I was startled. Didn't know what.\nSpeaker 5: It was at first. He said It's.\nSpeaker 2: Disney comes with the territory. Sunday night I was in my backyard yard. The smell of the, I guess, gas coming from the refineries over the way was nauseating. I've lived in Long.\nSpeaker 5: Beach for 20 years. In Wrigley.\nSpeaker 2: For 15. Comes with the territory. We had boats backed up in the air and in the waters here.\nSpeaker 5: Years ago there was talk about the US.\nSpeaker 2: Comes with the territory. I recognize what Long Beach is. It's a trade place with the ports. Not only does.\nSpeaker 5: Our local community, our federal community, but the world.\nSpeaker 2: Economy depends upon movement of goods and services out of Long Beach. I almost have a fatal. Attitude about living in Long Beach. And I don't think it's fair. I don't think.\nSpeaker 5: That Long Beach residents should go through the health risks that we go through. But I recognize.\nSpeaker 2: That it comes with the territory. We're not going to be able to slow down. The commerce at the ports comes with the territory. Now there there. You know, JetBlue wants to have an international airport at the Long Beach Airport.\nSpeaker 2: And we all know what that means. We all know where that's going to what that's going to mean. It's going to mean more revenue for JetBlue, more revenue for Long Beach. But at what price? There comes a time when we have to put not our health, but our children's health first before revenue.\nSpeaker 2: I know that it's kind of hard to stop the wheels of. Money. But that's what this is all about. JetBlue city of Long Beach making money. But at what price?\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: My name is Mario Cruz. I reside at 2315 Charlemagne in the fourth District, and I rise in support of Mr. Gurung. Mr. Austin motion to delay this vote. I appreciate his comments. As a resident of the fourth District, I have a voice and the residents of the fourth District have a voice, and that voice needs to be\nSpeaker 2: heard. I'm all for process, but there's also accountability. And with all due respect, none of you answer to my vote because I do not have a representative on this council. So notwithstanding your good remarks, you do not answer to me.\nSpeaker 2: Because I have not voted. And I want to vote. As far as time, it's not just the matter. Of bringing the council up to speed. There's the community consider. The community has to be about speed. You can't put a time limit on that.\nSpeaker 2: And certainly 60 days is not enough, in my opinion. So I would. Good asked. Asked Mr. Ralston in agreeing to reject the friendly amendment when he as much time as we can get to consider this very important issue for the residents of the Fourth District.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Good evening. Ron soc, formerly of the airport commission from 2000 to 2008. I don't know where to begin. Maybe just a few facts there. I've heard statements tonight that international flights mean more flights, mean noisier flights jeopardize the noise ordinance.\nSpeaker 2: The sooner that we can get to the point of studying this and showing that it will be, it's apparent that JetBlue is not asking for more flights right now. They're flying 20 to 25 flights out of their 32.\nSpeaker 2: They need to fill those gaps to make it more economically viable for them and for the city. And so they're simply asking for international flights, which are just the same number of planes, same number of gates. No increase.\nSpeaker 2: No increase in noise. And so some of these facts, some of these claims have to be dealt with because there is a serious misunderstanding in the community. And the other point that I want to make is that one of the things when I headed the commission that we stressed was that the members, as the council members, represent\nSpeaker 2: all the citizens of the city, not just their own constituents, as Stacy Mongeau pointed out. She actually those were thoughts that I had. And I can't see your timing, somebody sitting in front of it there. Okay. So JetBlue has been a proud partner to this city and they've done a lot for the city and they've not done\nSpeaker 2: damage to the city. And they are simply asking to have flights that will go to Mexico possibly, and it will not enlarge anything at the airport. I would just ask Councilman Austin and your anger to consider some kind of compression of the time period or if there's a way the staff can be given working on the studies\nSpeaker 2: even before the April election. That would be a great help. And also, I'm not quite sure city manager were the three year period. What's that's comprised of. And perhaps at some point you could explain why it's going to take three years.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Time time's all up. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the Council, Kurt Gaston, president of the Long Beach Airport Association. Thank you for taking the time tonight to discuss and receive our all of our comments on both sides.\nSpeaker 5: Of this issue. On the motion before you on behalf of the Board of the directors of the Long Beach Airport Association.\nSpeaker 10: And the airport business.\nSpeaker 5: Community.\nSpeaker 10: We again are here to confirm our unanimous support of the city's airport noise ordinance. We support your effort.\nSpeaker 2: To conduct the required due diligence on the.\nSpeaker 10: Facts that we believe support.\nSpeaker 5: Permitting.\nSpeaker 2: Permit international operations at the airport consistent with the provisions provided by the ordinance and slot allocation process. We appreciate the due diligence you need to receive in order to properly.\nSpeaker 5: Vet out and improve international flights. However, we ask you tonight not to unreasonably delay the process that will provide you those facts.\nSpeaker 10: But instead provide a 60 day window.\nSpeaker 2: Of time that will both permit the fourth District Council seat to be filled while providing staff the opportunity to finalize or prepare the required due diligence as a roadmap for you to consider all the specific and relevant details and facts.\nSpeaker 2: During this time, the candidates for the fourth District can participate and will be.\nSpeaker 5: Able to review the relevant facts and attend any community briefings.\nSpeaker 10: So that at the end of the 60 day.\nSpeaker 5: Period, the formal application.\nSpeaker 10: Can be submitted to this.\nSpeaker 5: Council for their review and action. Please do.\nSpeaker 2: Not consider further restricting use as an operational activities at the airport.\nSpeaker 10: That would.\nSpeaker 5: Be permitted under that noise ordinance.\nSpeaker 10: So that noise levels would be artificially kept below.\nSpeaker 2: That which is permitted. And any.\nSpeaker 10: International flight operations will only use existing.\nSpeaker 2: Slots, gates.\nSpeaker 5: Parking positions and no new passenger holding rooms. The arrival and destination.\nSpeaker 2: Locations for.\nSpeaker 10: Aircraft that will bring.\nSpeaker 2: Commerce, jobs and economic opportunity into the city in no way restrict or eliminate your opportunity or obligation as well as ours to manage and mitigate airport noise by enforcing without any fear what has and should be and continue to be a healthy, well defended policy.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: My name is Jane Naito. I'm a resident of the eighth District and have been since 1998. Mayor and City Council Members. You were all elected by the residents of Long Beach to represent their concerns and needs. Currently, the fourth District has no representation.\nSpeaker 8: In fairness to them, I strongly urge you to withhold any discussion or review of JetBlue's request for a Customs facility until after a fourth District Council person is in place. I know a plane flying from Mexico to Dallas makes no difference in the noise ordinance.\nSpeaker 8: I know that JetBlue is currently not using all the slots allotted to them, so the noise level is reasonably quiet. I know that the minimum 41 commercial flights are signed and that only six of the 25 commuter flights slots are now being utilized.\nSpeaker 8: What I don't know is if adding a customs facility to the Long Beach airport will invite the FAA and other airlines to challenge our current operation. I was part of the neighborhood group that challenged the city and business entities relating in 1923 against quadrupling the size of the airport to satisfy JetBlue.\nSpeaker 8: Thanks to our efforts, we have a beautiful airport that everybody loves. In addition to waiting until we have a fourth District Council member, I urge you to instruct city staff not to have any more closed door meetings with JetBlue.\nSpeaker 8: Some discussions have already occurred, and this is why it's raised the level of concern in the neighborhoods. We would love the opportunity to work with city staff and the Council on projects that impact us instead of finding out later what has been decided.\nSpeaker 8: Please consider the concerns and needs of the neighborhoods and the residents that voted you in office before the concerns and desires of JetBlue. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor Garcia and members of the council. My name is Rob Mitchell and I'm manager of government and airport affairs for JetBlue Airways, which is based here in Long Beach at the airport. Two weeks ago, my colleague Rob Land, our senior vice president for government affairs, stood before you and expressed JetBlue's continued and longstanding support for\nSpeaker 4: the sanctity of the noise ordinance that governs operations at the airport. The request JetBlue submitted recently was a direct ask of the city to begin a process of fact finding due diligence and discussion. With the letter we submitted, JetBlue is not asking for nor expecting the imminent arrival of international flights at the airport next week.\nSpeaker 4: Similarly, with the request we submitted, we were not expecting the study of a reasonable, modest addition to the capabilities of the airport to be postponed for 90 days after the next councilperson from the fourth District is seated. Something that would take us to the end of summer before any work could begin, let alone a decision be made\nSpeaker 4: at acquisition of a customs facility at the airport will take staff work by the city. The motion before the council tonight prohibits staff from doing exactly what they are tasked to do all of the homework and due diligence in order to bring it back to council.\nSpeaker 4: For a policy decision later, staff needs to have to begin to have these discussions with engineers, architects and the operations team. How it is financed needs to be investigated. And then after all that, the Council must submit a request to and receive approval from the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection before a lengthy construction project\nSpeaker 4: could commence. If this Council wishes to delay a request made by a solid corporate citizen and a request only to begin a process for as much as 4 to 6 months without any justification, then it certainly shouldn't. It should should not stand in the way of the enormous research, due diligence and fact finding the city needs to\nSpeaker 4: undertake. JetBlue strongly supports that any delay this council votes on tonight explicitly avoid delaying the start of this critical investigatory work. The airport manager has a request from the majority tenant at the airport and undertaking the work I have described in no way rushes this process, nor does it force this council to act one way or another\nSpeaker 4: . If the city truly wants to be an international city, a progressive city, and a pro-jobs city, it must at least explore all the opportunities to do so. Long Beach has has has long been and will continue to be an airport with tight restrictions and a flight ordinance that enforces tight restrictions on flights.\nSpeaker 4: And we believe the airport is simply being utilized far less than these limitations currently announced allow. I urge the Council not to support the unnecessary delay and allow staff to begin the much needed work right away and shorten the minimum timeframe for which it can be allowed to come back to the council.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you very much. Mr. Mayor. Council members. My name's Joe Miller. I'm the chair of the Los Altos Center, adjacent neighborhoods in the fourth District. And I can't tell you how many hours I've spent in this chamber dealing with airport issues over the years.\nSpeaker 4: Long time before most of you have been here. And I can tell you that this is a very important issue for the fourth District, the fourth District residents. This is the thing that unites them as a community is their concern over the airport.\nSpeaker 4: And it's something that our councilman and now Assemblyman Patrick O'Donnell understood. In fact, that's one of the reasons he was elected, is because our former councilperson did not understand that. And that's one reason he was elected. And for him to reach out to you from Sacramento on this issue is very, very important.\nSpeaker 4: And no one understands the fourth District right now more than Councilman and now Assemblyman O'Donnell. And the fact that he's reached out to you is very important. And I can tell you from my neighborhood, this is very, very important to our neighborhood.\nSpeaker 4: And as the JetBlue person said, we want to be a progressive city. We also want to be a Democratic city. And we really don't have a voice here. And as other people have said, we really don't have anyone who is accountable to us.\nSpeaker 4: You know, Patrick would pick up the telephone, call us, talk to the neighborhood leaders, just as I'm sure many of you do to your own neighborhood leaders. None of you have my phone number. None of you can reach out to the neighborhood leaders in the fourth District, and we really need that.\nSpeaker 4: The other thing that Patrick did when the airport size was being debated, he worked with the other council people to come up with that. We don't have someone to work with you right now. We don't have a voice to to tell you our concerns.\nSpeaker 4: We know that you talk to each other and you meet with each other. You you do that. We need someone on behind the dais doing that for all of us in the fourth District. And believe me, it is very, very important to all of us in the fourth District.\nSpeaker 4: That's why I'm here tonight, to ask you to please support Councilman Austin and councilman during this motion. And thank you both for bringing it forward.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Mayor and City Council. My name is Richard Ivey. I live at 242 East Bixby Road. I'm president of the Las Vegas Neighborhood Association. I love our city. I love Long Beach. When I was a student at Cal State, Long Beach, the professor would have to stop class twice an hour to wait for the planes to go over\nSpeaker 2: . I thank you, Mr. Austin, as and Mr. Durango, both representing our neighborhood in both the seventh and eighth districts. For your stance here tonight and how important this is. This is something that our noise ordinance is extremely fragile.\nSpeaker 2: And the impact that this could have if. Planes decide to come in here because it's convenient and it opens up an opportunity to mess with the noise ordinance, which I don't think the citizens of Long Beach fully understand how big a decision this is.\nSpeaker 2: If you mess with that noise ordinance, you could be looking at 100 to 130 flights a day. And I don't think the citizens of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 5: Are aware of how serious this issue is.\nSpeaker 2: And I would just ask that you not mess with it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next week, the police.\nSpeaker 12: Good evening.\nSpeaker 8: My name is Bill Goodell Outdoor. I reside in the eighth district, four, four, six five Cerritos Avenue. And I'm here to support Councilmember your ongoing Austin's motion or agenda item. Thank you for bringing it forward. I wanted to address a couple of things, specifically that Councilwoman Manga Mongo said earlier.\nSpeaker 8: You said that you're used to yourself as representing the whole city. I accept that. And you also said you represent the businesses and since the airport is in your business, then this district, that means JetBlue is your constituent.\nSpeaker 8: Correct? Okay. So basically, you you represent JetBlue among all of you guys. That would be your constituent. So I understand that seems logic to me. Well, they don't get to vote no. Maybe not with their voices, but with something else.\nSpeaker 12: Anyway, I didn't want no, I didn't want I didn't want this.\nSpeaker 8: I didn't want that. This reality. Sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Guys. Let's just try to. Yeah.\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. Okay. But anyway, I think it's reasonable to for you to suggest let's let's just keep the process going. Let's start the process. You said it's a three year process or.\nSpeaker 8: The three year plan. You forget that it's already been going on since over two years. City manager has said that there has been private discussions with city council members. Some of you, maybe not.\nSpeaker 12: All of you, but there has been discussion.\nSpeaker 8: The process has been going on for over two years and maybe just another five months, and it's going to be completed. And for this to continue without the representation of the fourth District is just not responsible at all.\nSpeaker 8: You're suggesting that what? Just finished a process? We need all the facts. We'll get the facts in five months. We'll have the new councilmember here and we'll bring her or him up to speed. I would suggest that it's going to require a lot more than bringing her or him up to speed.\nSpeaker 8: You need to think of this person needing to be in the process. If the people of the fourth district really are going to be represented, their representative needs to be in the process from the beginning as much as possible to the end, not just be brought up to speed.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members, Darryl Supernova, resident of the fourth District. Thank you for bringing this motion forward. Councilmembers Austin and Ranga after the study session on the 17th. I saw the mayor in the next day and I compliment him on his handling of one of the questions.\nSpeaker 5: And I said, You know what? I really like the way you reacted. You got out in front of it. You owned it. You addressed the fact that the city had made a mistake and talked to the city manager.\nSpeaker 5: You referenced him and said it was a personal.\nSpeaker 2: Issue and we took care of it. So first, I'd like to compliment.\nSpeaker 5: You, Councilmember, for getting out in front of this issue, owning it and putting it in front of the people. Also to I'll just react to a couple of things that were said. Council Member Mungo, thank you for taking up the slack.\nSpeaker 5: And to your staff, we are out a snow day. But again, she does not have a vote.\nSpeaker 4: So that's the issue here. Finally, there was a previous.\nSpeaker 5: Speaker said there's some type of question about the three year time frame. I just referenced our previous airport director said there was a three year frame. Our current airport director says.\nSpeaker 4: There's a three year time frame. These are the.\nSpeaker 2: Experts. And in today's Language.\nSpeaker 5: Business Journal, I think there's.\nSpeaker 2: An online edition. Now, Dave Willunga has.\nSpeaker 10: An article that.\nSpeaker 4: Has that same quote. So I just want to clear clarify that point.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: I am Dr. Marshall Zamsky, 3917 Linden Avenue. And I wanted to definitely support Al Austin and Roberta Yar'adua's motion. I think it's very important. My concern is that we elected you guys. And to be on the council to represent us and yet the world.\nSpeaker 2: The wheels have been turning for an awful long time and it seems to me that the foundations of our country are based on democracy, and yet our city council doesn't seem to have almost any input into the process.\nSpeaker 2: So my feeling is that to support this this motion and to say that the city council should be involved at every point and be able to veto anything just because one big corporation wants some wants to muscle their way around here.\nSpeaker 2: It shouldn't be. It shouldn't be allowed. And that isn't what we elected our representatives, our city councilors to do. So anyway, that's. I just wanted to say that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. Joe Sopel. You have my address on file, Mr. Mayor. City Council members. Alan Roberto, thank you very much for bringing this forward. It's been said in here that we're going to give time for the candidate, whoever is elected, to be brought up to speed.\nSpeaker 5: But the truth.\nSpeaker 2: Is, none of you are up to speed.\nSpeaker 5: You know, we fought this a decade or so ago. And coincidentally, the same people who were saying build it, build a build it are the same people here who have stood in front of you tonight and two weeks ago and said, Oh, yeah, we need international flights.\nSpeaker 5: It's a good idea. What's a good idea for JetBlue? If I was, JetBlue would be the thing I would be doing international flights. In fact, JetBlue has been working behind your backs. It's been going on for at least the last year.\nSpeaker 5: They've been talking to city staff. They've been talking to other council members who want to listen to them. But really, it's been behind staff. Why is this such a good idea? We've got LAX, we've got John Wayne. What we have is one hell of a great municipal airport.\nSpeaker 5: We fought for it. We didn't want it to be industry standards. We want it to be what it is. That was the key word. Industry standards quadruple the size. A previous airport advisor president stood up in front of you a little while ago and said, it's not expansion.\nSpeaker 2: It's not going to get any bigger. The truth is, it will get bigger.\nSpeaker 5: There is more square footage going to be added. They've got to build a terminal for international flights. They can't do it out of what we have. That's just not going to happen. We can't afford it. Our our airport is perfect.\nSpeaker 5: It's a perfect.\nSpeaker 2: Relationship. Don't screw.\nSpeaker 5: With it. Leave it alone. We've got something good. Tackle the big, big issues like the marijuana issue or downtown. We've got plenty of issues to tackle. You know, there's quite a few people in here holding signs right now.\nSpeaker 5: Back in the old days, we used to fill every seat with a sign. And people were really upset and they had a lot of energy. And that's what's going to happen again if you proceed on this. Now, we're just talking about a little study.\nSpeaker 5: It's referred to as the the camel getting its nose under the tent. That's what we're talking about. I'm a salesman. I know when you're not going a door and you want to get in there, what you do is put your toe in there, you put your knee in there, get your butt in there, and then you're into\nSpeaker 5: that door. Don't let JetBlue do that. They can wait because whatever decisions you do make is going to last for a very, very long time. Don't be rushed. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Joe. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Larry, would you click as the address? I do not live in the fourth district, but let me say this. I've been very impressed with the counsel position from the ninth District. And when our good councilman Price becomes mayor, maybe in eight years or with luck, maybe even sooner.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Depending upon how fast in the Ninth Circuit Court moves. All right. Consider moving into the third district with very sharp mind. I like your approach. I see. This is one. If this project goes through regardless of its merits.\nSpeaker 2: It'll obviously as the last speaker been mentioned, it's going to be there for ages. All right. So the barn on this issue is a barn. It clearly is not on fire. Absolutely. So take the time to review it thoroughly.\nSpeaker 2: In respect to Councilperson Mungo's. Volunteering to vote for that district, giving her background. The people need to feel they are represented 100%. And as one who lives in a third district, I would take great umbrage of somebody coming in from another area that had not studied as well and is very familiar with anything related to Alameda Play\nSpeaker 2: or the Marine Stadium. That's not to say that your work is not appreciated. But the fact is, these people deserve to have someone there that is their official representative. Who they can hold responsible. For whatever vote, whichever way that person votes.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Larry. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: Cecelia Leach.\nSpeaker 6: Seventh District 3645 Myrtle Avenue. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and all the council members for listening to all of our comments. I want to thank council members Austin and Ranga for putting this motion.\nSpeaker 8: Forward, which I strongly support as well.\nSpeaker 6: It seems to me that one option that hasn't yet been discussed is the option of not moving forward at all.\nSpeaker 8: And while.\nSpeaker 12: There while.\nSpeaker 6: Some may oppose, some may support that option, so far, the JetBlue representatives appear to be saying that this would simply delay the process and assume that.\nSpeaker 8: The entire process would go forward.\nSpeaker 6: I think that that is not, as other speakers have mentioned, a democratic process. And we need to have all options on the table and we need to have all of the city council members here.\nSpeaker 8: To discuss those options. I also.\nSpeaker 6: Just want to register some surprise at Councilmember Mango's assertion that supporting this would be pandering to.\nSpeaker 8: Those of us.\nSpeaker 6: Who are citizens with signs in the audience of which I am one, which seems to be.\nSpeaker 1: Contradictory.\nSpeaker 8: To her.\nSpeaker 6: Statement that she represents the entire city. Thank you. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: If you like. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 12: Hello. Good evening. Hello. Hi, Mayor. It's been a while. Mayor Garcia? Yes. And council members first. You know, I had something very nice and calm to read to you, but I have to make a comment on some of the discussion that was going on earlier when Claudia and Mr. West said that there was no study going on\nSpeaker 12: right now. That's a key word right now. There were actually two studies done. One was presented to the council, and I'm not sure what happened to the other one. For Askar and Associates presented in November of 2013 and the Megadeal Economic Study made comments that wouldn't support any further economic development of the city.\nSpeaker 12: Both of them stated minimal economic impact. Mr. West I'm going to say that you should have asked the Council if they were interested in moving forward with this in 2013. They have been operating behind the scenes, doing studies, meeting with Homeland Security, taking it, doing term sheets and and lots of communication going in this direction while the\nSpeaker 12: neighborhoods have been sitting back there not understanding what was coming forward. So with that, that's that's my rant. And now I would like to say the nice things that I have to say, and that is to acknowledge that every district in our city deserves a leader that can advocate on their behalf, especially when such serious commitments are\nSpeaker 12: being considered. That's good leadership, and it's also the right thing to do. Imagine if the First District had not had representation over Pier J. The Green Port Policy, the Middle Harbor or other mega influencing projects from the Port of Long Beach that have daily impacts on Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 12: If the Second District was not represented in discussions on our downtown plan, Civic Center ideas or the Entertainment District Studies, if the third district leadership was vacant without direction on the wetlands development, the second and PCH controversial plans, the Belmont Plaza Pool or the Naples seawalls, the fifth District.\nSpeaker 12: As homogenous as it appears, houses one of the most controversial aspects of our city, our airport, just as the port and the downtown belongs to everyone, regardless of their home district. So does the airport, which lies in the center of some of our most successful neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 12: The the fifth has been faced with challenges with the transfer of McDonnell Douglas to Boeing, the massive reductions of Boeing, and then, of course, the direction of the Boeing development would take what it would take to best benefit and protect Long Beach and its citizens, the sixth District.\nSpeaker 12: It's a challenged community that bears the scars of poverty and the reputation of being outcast. Without a dedicated community person to lead, would they have found the solution to the loss of the Kroc Center at Shattuck Field or seen positive development within and around Cambodia town, the seventh District?\nSpeaker 12: In many ways a tale of two cities without a leader to champion the 710 expansion plan or the up and coming skate project. What would those neighborhoods be confronted with today?\nSpeaker 5: Ray I.\nSpeaker 0: Got a.\nSpeaker 12: Are you going to make me stop before I get to the district?\nSpeaker 0: It's not you know, I can I know I have to follow I have to follow the.\nSpeaker 12: Rules, actually. You know, the rules do allow you to to give me 30 seconds.\nSpeaker 8: Right.\nSpeaker 12: But I'll tell you what, I don't have to go.\nSpeaker 0: What I'm going to do is as a as a as a deference. You are a former member of this body. I will let you finish, but I'd want the public to know that generally if it wasn't because you're in a formal council, it's very difficult to continue.\nSpeaker 0: So please continue.\nSpeaker 12: I appreciate that, Mayor. Our eighth district representatives have always been required to educate and lead our city when it comes to issues related to our Long Beach airport. Imagine if there had not been an ED toddler, Jeff Kellogg on board to provide direction.\nSpeaker 12: Thank you, Al. And thank you, Roberto, for taking the lead on this. And then finally, the ninth District, much like the sixth uptown, has felt isolated and ignored for many, many years without the leadership and vision of Jerry Schultz, Val Lurch, Steve Neal and now Rex Richardson.\nSpeaker 12: What would the conditions be up there today? Together. The nine districts make up our vibrant, diverse city of Long Beach. What happens to one district will eventually in some way impact the others, creating ample time for the next fourth district councilperson to settle in.\nSpeaker 12: Allows time for each one of you to better understand the history of our airport.\nSpeaker 2: Where I got.\nSpeaker 5: To.\nSpeaker 12: It gives you time. It gives you time to consider the pros and cons and the benefits and the risks. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Hello. My name is Richard Lindemann.\nSpeaker 5: I'm running for the fourth District Council seat.\nSpeaker 2: My address is 1605 Ohio Avenue. And I want to thank Alison.\nSpeaker 5: And Roberto Urunga for bringing forth this measure.\nSpeaker 2: And I think.\nSpeaker 5: Either 90 days or 60 days is probably a good thing. And I'll give part of my.\nSpeaker 2: Time to her so.\nSpeaker 5: It'll it'll work out okay. But I really appreciate it. And I think I truly think that we need to have a voice on the on the council. So I hope that you do pass this.\nSpeaker 2: And safety measure for us. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for your work. And I if there's anyone else wants to speak, I'm going to close the speakers list with you. If you're not up to the podium, please. No. Okay. I'm going to close I'm going to close the speakers list.\nSpeaker 0: You're our last speaker. Please begin. Hi. My name is Robert Casado.\nSpeaker 5: I live on a 2235 Miramar Avenue. I'm in the fifth District. Thank you for increasing the wattage on our lights on our street. We really appreciate that. I don't have any stats or any numbers here to show you or.\nSpeaker 2: To give you.\nSpeaker 10: What I do have is a love for aircraft.\nSpeaker 5: I grew up in La mirada, close to Fort and airport, always listening to private planes fly over. There was always air shows. I lived in Torrance for a while, close to Zamperini airfield, which was wonderful because there's always small aircraft flying Long Beach.\nSpeaker 5: I love Long Beach more than anything right now because it has a wonderful airport for short flights. For me, it's perfect.\nSpeaker 0: Sitting on my couch watching.\nSpeaker 4: TV, I can.\nSpeaker 5: Watch C-17s take off. I can watch F-18s go 500 miles an hour, pass the tower. I can watch.\nSpeaker 10: B-17s.\nSpeaker 5: B-29, super fortresses and any vintage aircraft fly over my house, you know, a few times a year. So my love for the aircraft, I turn into a schoolboy when I hear the radial engines of the Catalina airboats flying over just because it sounds different now, nobody does.\nSpeaker 0: That for 747 or 737.\nSpeaker 10: Or anything like that, because every jet engine like that of.\nSpeaker 5: That size sounds the same to me. My love for Long Beach is huge. I don't ever want to leave it. I love it so much. I love my fit district. I do a lot, but I honestly don't have.\nSpeaker 0: Any numbers or anything here that's substantial.\nSpeaker 5: Except for a love of the aircraft. If you add more aircraft, more large aircraft, you're taking away the airspace from our pilots who have private planes, small helicopters, and you're taking it away from our World War Two veterans who sometimes come to Long Beach in those World War Two aircraft they fought.\nSpeaker 5: And so by taking up that space, you're taking away the love that I have for everything that is Long Beach and JetBlue. You just lost a customer.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay. Thank you, sir. That that concludes our speakers list and certainly, I think everybody for giving their comments. So we're going to go back to the city council and just so that we get a reminder of where we're at.\nSpeaker 0: City Attorney There is a motion on the floor just as a reminder from Mr. Austin and Mr. Rangel, which is at present. Is that correct, sir?\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor. The motion on the floor, as I currently understand it, is and I'm not sure if the friendly amendment was accepted, but it would be to delay. Further action for the direction of City Council and direct city manager to delay any request for direction regarding a customs facility until either 90 days or 60 days after full representation\nSpeaker 4: . So this would require the city manager to put an item on the agenda after 60 days. The Councilmember for the fourth district is in their seat for 60 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So that so I'm not I don't care who made that friendly to Councilman Pryce did. So I want to be sure we know where we're at before we continue the speaker's list here. So, Mr. Austin. Mr. Austin, are you accepting that friendly 90.\nSpeaker 11: You know what? I want to wait to hear from the rest of the council on this. Okay. We accept the friendly women.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So then the motion on the floor is as presented just for the record then. So I have speakers list councilman mongo.\nSpeaker 12: So let's start out on a positive note. I want to promote that this weekend we are having a fly in the Ford event at the airport and I hope that each of you will take an opportunity to revisit and appreciate the airport as it is today.\nSpeaker 12: Even if the vote did not pass tonight, that means that this would still be. Delayed at least through the study process through at least August. I want to make a couple of quick comments. Once elected. Knowing the importance of this item, I quickly met with the advocates and adversaries of the airport, including the Honorable.\nSpeaker 12: Where did she go? Where did she go? There she is. And Joe Suppo. And since then I have met with Joe, who, while I do not have his phone number, we do email occasionally and. I want to say that I do listen to public comment, and I really appreciate the comment from Mario Cruz, because while I do\nSpeaker 12: feel that every vote I take is a big part of this city's future, I always have such a positive attitude. I never considered the fact that the fourth District couldn't recall me. But it is true, and I appreciate that component.\nSpeaker 12: And that being said. I also want to support the person who said that the fee for landing after hours is not enough. I constantly hear planes land after that hour. Every time a plane lands after that hour, I get a call from my mother, of which I remind her to call the noise hotline so that the airline\nSpeaker 12: has to pay a fee to the library. But I cannot increase that fee without causing potential risk to the noise ordinance. And so that is why we keep the status quo in regard to that component. If it were my choice, it would be five to 10 to $15000 per violation as it escalated with multiple.\nSpeaker 12: Issues. So let me let me offer a. A friendly amendment. I would like to have the study back and then I want 60 days because I want to use that 60 days to go into my community and have community meetings.\nSpeaker 12: And so having 60 days before nothing happens, which makes no sense because right now the city manager said he's not coming back until August. And so. That is significantly more time than is necessary for our colleagues to get up to speed.\nSpeaker 12: So what I would like to do is I would like the study to begin immediately and then I would like the two from four to the council so that and I would like it published publicly on the three website.\nSpeaker 12: So then I can email my mailing list, schedule one or two community meetings to hear how the communities which many of my community neighborhoods also fall in this district. And so then that would give me the time to go out and do the legwork.\nSpeaker 12: Because one of the things that really. Frustrated me about other items that come before this council is that they are given they give us ten days and ten days is not even enough time to get a community group together to discuss these kinds of matters.\nSpeaker 12: And so I think it's actually about the same amount of time that you are asking for, but in backwards order. Oh, no, no, no.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, I'm not. Hey, guys. I want to make sure that behind the dinosaur real quick. So just so I'm clear, Councilman Mango is asking for a friendly amendment to Councilman Austin. Councilor Brosnan.\nSpeaker 11: So Councilmember Mongeau, I do appreciate the the brainpower that you put toward this and the willingness to to kind of meet in the middle. But I don't see that as a friendly amendment. And I will tell you why, because the the intent here is to get a fourth District Council member seated and then have that person as\nSpeaker 11: part of the process. In terms of whatever study there is there, there are going to be points and issues that that that we deliberate as a city council to give direction to the city manager on. And so that is the intent of the the the motion here.\nSpeaker 12: I guess. Oh, don't clap yet. I guess the challenge for me on that is when the city management and the staff who we pay a great deal of money to and trust for, if we don't like what they do, we then have the opportunity to then remove that city manager.\nSpeaker 12: But I do put a lot of trust in them and the work that they do and they do gain direction. So I'm going to make a substitute motion that we begin the study and then the motion comes before council 60 days after that, so that I have time to go and reach into the communities and hear their\nSpeaker 12: feedback. Because while it's great to have a bunch of people come to council, I hear time and time again from the East Side that it is difficult for our parents and our soccer moms and all of the rest of them to make it down to City Hall on a Tuesday night at 5:00.\nSpeaker 12: And so I want to have those meetings in my community.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Hey, guys. I want to make sure that we're we have a process that's respectful to it's hard to hear when there's people chatting. So I want to make sure that we're the council is able to deliberate fairly, but I want to make sure that I understand the substitute motion as I'm not sure.\nSpeaker 0: So the substitute motion was to begin the process of gathering the research now. And then the fourth district member sat and then six days after that, what exactly what happens?\nSpeaker 12: So I would like it to come as a two from four memo to the City Council posted on the website so that the community can deliberate for 60 days and discuss the ideas that are presented and or then make direction to the city manager to do additional studies.\nSpeaker 12: Because what I don't want is a bunch of meetings with no data. I don't think we can afford a customs terminal. I don't know where people think we're going to get ten, 20, $30 million. I don't know why there's a point of even discussing it if we don't know the facts behind it.\nSpeaker 12: So I would like the facts gathered. That's why.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So there's. So just for the record, there's a substitute motion. And is there a second on the substitute? Yes, there's a second on the substitute. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. And now we're going to move on to the speaker's list, which we have.\nSpeaker 0: So we'll continue that. And ladies and gentlemen, I want to make sure that we got we are we want you to be respectful. The council was respectful when everyone spoke. I want to make sure that we're all respectful to this deliberation process.\nSpeaker 0: This is we go through this on every issue that is big. And it's very important to obviously all of you. But please give the council the respect that they so they can deliberate. I also want you all to hear the comments.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I. Want to reiterate that I support Councilmember Austin on this and I understand the intent behind it. One of my residents, Mr. Salt, spoke, and I respect him and I have incredible respect for him.\nSpeaker 6: But I wanted to talk a little bit about a few things that he said, because he is one of my residents and he's someone who has a great deal of experience with this. This is going to be a long term process.\nSpeaker 6: And I just think that there is no harm in waiting for our full body to be here as we start this process together. And I appreciate some of the comments that folks have made about, you know, you don't know the history.\nSpeaker 6: That's true. That's true. Certainly people with much more extensive experience and history of the airport could have run for office, but they're not here. So the reality is that, you know, we took the as glamorous as it may seem, the process of jumping out there and trying to serve our communities.\nSpeaker 6: And we are trying to educate ourselves and understand the history. And I'm meeting with anybody who wants to meet with me on this issue. I've been meeting with everybody. And and I'm going to continue to do that. But I want to make it very clear that there is nobody sitting up here that knows the third district the\nSpeaker 6: way I know the third district. There is nobody up here that cares about the third district the way I care about the third district. I wake up every morning, every day. I represent the entire city, but I know my district in and out and I know what those people need.\nSpeaker 6: And I'm going to always fight for them. I represent the entire city, but I think just because of the introduction that I've received of the fourth District, specifically their businesses in regards to the medical marijuana issue, that they currently feel a void in representation because they had a very strong advocate for a long time and they no\nSpeaker 6: longer have that person. And I think that is a very valid point. And I told Council member Austin from day one when we started talking about this, that I would support him on this. The reason I offered the friendly of 60 is to try to reach some middle ground so that we could be somewhat united as a\nSpeaker 6: council. I mean, that would be my hope because I'm going to tell you right now that and I appreciate the mayor clarifying that the issue before us tonight is when we're going to start this process. It's not the viability of an international terminal.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, it's not whether we like JetBlue or not. I fly JetBlue with my family. I think they've been incredible business partners. I don't think that's the issue tonight. I think the issue is when do we start this process?\nSpeaker 6: I, for one, am completely open to exploring the idea. I'm not against this idea. I'm open to exploring it and studying it. It's just a matter of when do we start that process? That is the limit of the discussion tonight.\nSpeaker 6: And we're talking about a three year process. I don't think 60 days or 90 days, I don't think is is any amount of time in the big scheme of things. I will say that one of the reasons I recommended 60 Days was because I feel that the authors of this item didn't feel that strongly about the 90\nSpeaker 6: days to begin with, that they were open to considering a different timeline. It's not that they were steadfast on the 90 days, and so it was really is a point of compromise to try to get us all together.\nSpeaker 6: But you know what? We don't all have to be together. We don't all have to be united. That's okay. It's nice if we proceed that way, but that doesn't always work out. So that's my recommendation. I will be supporting Councilman Austin, and I would hope that he would consider the friendly amendment even if it doesn't result in\nSpeaker 6: consensus. I would hope that he would. I think 60 days is going to be enough time for our new council colleague to engage and meaningfully take this on. That's just my opinion.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is Vice Mayor Lowenthal.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. And so right now we have the substitute. Is that right? Councilmember Price. I think the comments that you had made, were you asking about a friendly to Councilmember Mango's motion?\nSpeaker 6: I are checking for clarification right now, but I had made a friendly and. Councilman Austin had said he would like to wait until he hears from his colleagues to decide whether he'd accept.\nSpeaker 11: Just a point of order. I don't believe I can accept that friendly right now. But should it come back and the motion before us fell on that friendly, we could definitely have a favorable conversation about a friendly amendment.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. I want to thank Councilwoman Price for her comments. I agree with you. I'm not in favor of not seeking information. I do want to know and have this issue vetted. I think it needs to be vetted.\nSpeaker 8: But I also respect and value the opinions that you come to this council with tonight. While you might not be representative of the entire fourth District or fifth District or the entire city, you've taken the time to come out here.\nSpeaker 8: And and what I can hear is that you would like more time for this deliberation. I agree with that. At the same time, I also have never been in favor of stopping our insatiable quest for information, for knowledge.\nSpeaker 8: And I think that's part of why we're here as well. We're not here because we know all the answers or we have all the data I count on. And I think each council member counts on our staff and whomever the staff hires with council direction on the information that they bring back, there's just no way this is\nSpeaker 8: a part time council. And so I would be troubled if we actually put a halt to acquiring the knowledge. And so I'm not fearful of that. I'm not fearful of what the outcome might be. I actually like to more no more than less.\nSpeaker 8: And so, Councilmember Austin, given that this is something that you're working on, you feel very passionate about, each of us feels very passionately about it as well. I mean, none of us has a monopoly on any particular issue, but.\nSpeaker 8: Would you be open to? Councilmember Mango's motion, if I can recall it correctly, is to continue work. And have I believe she said have the two for from come back in 90 days would you be open to. No.\nSpeaker 8: Can you repeat that.\nSpeaker 12: The two four from would still take I think the city manager said five months. So that would be August and then that would give us time, 60 days, August and September to meet with our community. My fear is if we move this into the Christmas time, turnout from the community plummets.\nSpeaker 12: And so I was hoping to have really good, nourishing dialog with my constituents with facts in my hand. I don't want to have meetings that have no facts. And so I was just looking for data. And then 60 days, it actually comes out to the same or more time than our asked for, which is why I'm so\nSpeaker 12: confused of why the crowd didn't like it, because it it just makes no sense to me.\nSpeaker 8: I'm confused, I think probably because I was perhaps my being confused wasn't unique. Okay, now I understand that does sound like the right the same amount of time as Councilmember Austin had asked for. And so if we can focus on one key aspect that you raised, Councilmember Austin, which I think others have raised and concur with, is\nSpeaker 8: the seating of the Fourth District Council member. I believe it's very important. It's critical. And so if we can benchmark. Whatever motion it is to first that person being seated. But also make sure the staff doesn't stop its work.\nSpeaker 8: I'm what I don't want us to communicate is that we are afraid of continuing research and work. When the point of decision comes back, that council member will be here to provide direction, to provide input, to deliberate with the rest of us.\nSpeaker 8: We are not taking action. And so my question is, would you be open to a motion that whether it's council member Mungo's or your own, a motion that would ensure that the fourth District Council person is seated? Staff is able to continue its work that we are not putting a gag order on their due diligence, which is\nSpeaker 8: really in all of our best interest at least to have that knowledge. You don't have to act on the knowledge. I don't either. And then to determine a time frame when the item comes back after the person is seated, whether that's 60 days, 90 days, sometime before Christmas, I hope, because I agree.\nSpeaker 8: I think Thanksgiving to Christmas is an unfortunate time for policy items, but not for anything else. So would you consider that?\nSpeaker 11: The long and short answer is no because. Because the point, the spirit and intent of the agenda item was to halt any work that has been done up to this point. You know, I think it's important for the city council to have input in on the direction on how we move forward.\nSpeaker 11: We just got a letter last week from Jet Blue, right. Asking us to move forward again. They are asking us to move forward. Not compelling us, not pushing us. There's nothing in their letter that says we have to move forward at all.\nSpeaker 11: Be quite honest with you. So. So I like Councilmember Pryce and many other council members. I'm open to hearing the case, but I don't think we should be committing any more staff resources because we've already committed quite a bit up to this point without council direction.\nSpeaker 11: We need to make sure that there is clear council direction on how we move forward and proceed forward. And a fourth district representative needs to be seated. For us to do that.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. I know.\nSpeaker 0: They surprise me a little.\nSpeaker 8: So thank you, Councilmember Austin. I think that's. I'm I'm glad I asked the question and I have that clarification from you. For the most part, I agree with you. I mean, I'm not in agreement over staff stopping work.\nSpeaker 8: So if I can ask, Mr. West, what is this work that just I know you've said it a couple of times, but please reiterate it for me. What is this work that you're doing?\nSpeaker 5: I think it's clear that back in 2013, JetBlue approached our current airport director, Mario Rodriguez, and there were discussions. There were two memos that were sent to the city council regarding those discussions. At that time, there was a lot of things happening in the city where the Civic Center going.\nSpeaker 5: We had a lot of stuff going on at Tidelands. So I directed Mr. Rodriguez just to stop and let's wait until we cleared our plate a little bit to go forward. A few months later, Mr. Rodriguez left us for another position, and then we made the decision.\nSpeaker 5: I made the decision informing the council that we weren't going to take this up until Mr. Francis was seated. So Mr. Francis is seated. So this brings us to where we're at today. So at this stage, what we would do with the council direction would go hire an expert firm in the customs arena, and they would work\nSpeaker 5: with us to provide us the metrics where we could come to the city council and let you know whether this is something that can possibly be done financially. Can it be done administratively? Can it be done operatively? Can it be done geographically?\nSpeaker 5: Where would you put it and how would it operate and all that? Again, this would not carry any recommendation whatsoever. If we found out early on that it doesn't make financial sense. If it doesn't make financial sense, we wouldn't go forward with it.\nSpeaker 5: But after a five month period with this consultant looking at industry standards for airports and look at airports of our size throughout America that have done this kind of stuff, then in five months, we'd given that study to the city council.\nSpeaker 5: Then the city council would discuss that study and what to do with it.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Thank you. So I would like to make a substitute. Substitute motion. And that motion would be to start the process or continue the process, as Mr. West has indicated, and come back in 90 days after the council district.\nSpeaker 8: I'm sorry, after the member of the council. It's a little late night after the fourth District Council member is seated. It's not.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So, guys, ladies. Gentlemen, I can't continue that. Please. I just want to make sure we're being respectful. That's a different motion than the original motion. So I just want to make sure that we're being respectful. The difference and the key difference of that motion and the original motion.\nSpeaker 0: Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. City Attorney, is that Mr. Austin's original motion would come back for an affirmative vote of the council before automatically moving forward. Is that is that correct?\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\nSpeaker 4: The original motion asked for direction from the council prior to beginning the study is described.\nSpeaker 0: So that's that's a very different motion. So I just want to make sure that that we're very clear. Okay. So we have now a a substitute substitute. Is there a second on the substitute substitute? Okay. There is a second.\nSpeaker 0: Can you.\nSpeaker 10: Okay, so let me just get clarity. You got how many? How much time is this?\nSpeaker 8: 90 days after the person is seated in the fourth district.\nSpeaker 10: So the way I see this before.\nSpeaker 0: I mean. Well, hold on, Councilman. You're next on the Q.\nSpeaker 10: So, no, I don't I'm not I have questions about her motion.\nSpeaker 0: You can you can go into it because you're next on the Q.\nSpeaker 10: So I'm tracking this. So it looks like Councilman Austin's motion says, okay, folks, get seat in two months in the fourth District. Correct. And 30 days after the election, they'll get seated. Right? They'll get seated. They won't get seated the day they're elected.\nSpeaker 10: It's when they get seat. Two months from now, they get seated. Then three months it would come back to the council after after 90 days per your motion, it will come back to the council. So that puts us at five months.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. Or friendly 60. And then it and then it says five months later, there will be. That's how long it takes for the study to be concluded. The correct city manager. Five months.\nSpeaker 5: The study would take approximately five months.\nSpeaker 10: So five months. My calculation that puts us January 2016 is ten months from now. That puts us in January. Councilmember Vice Mayor, where does your so yours has us in 30 days. Know it? How many days after the election?\nSpeaker 8: 90.\nSpeaker 10: So 90 days after the two months it takes for the person.\nSpeaker 8: Not after the election. After they're seated.\nSpeaker 10: So after they're seated. Correct. They'll be seated in May. So that puts us at five months from now. So five months from now, that puts us in one August. So the question between the two motions are when the city council gets a vote on it.\nSpeaker 10: August or December.\nSpeaker 0: And the key difference between the two, I think, is it's also when staff would actually begin the data collection piece and so on. On Councilman Austin's motion, the data collection would not begin until sometime a few a couple of months after the council person is seated.\nSpeaker 0: But for that data collection to begin, it would first require a affirmative vote of the city council. The difference with Vice Mayor Lowenthal is motion is the motion. Would the process for the city manager would begin now, which, according to the city manager would take approximately five months.\nSpeaker 0: And so that the that the couple of months after the person is seated would fall around five months. And so it would be around the the August time period. So that's I think that's the difference.\nSpeaker 10: Here's here's the challenge that I want to I want to get to a place. I'm hoping that we can get to a place. And I understand you have a motion. And because I have the floor, I could second it.\nSpeaker 10: But I want to see if things are still malleable. Here's here's what I'd like to see. There's the difference between the two or is a difference of five months. And I need to have an understanding, like right now, the way I see this is very the council's very divided.\nSpeaker 10: I'd like to see if there's some middle ground and see if there's a place, if Councilmember Alston, like what do you really want to get out of this? Do you want to get this? January 2016 is where you want to take up this issue.\nSpeaker 10: Is that what you're trying to get to or in council vice chair more so I see this timeline is the same timeline that the that the city manager put forth. If he were to start today, it would take five months.\nSpeaker 10: So five months from today would be essentially the same timeline. So we've got a five month gap and I don't want to be in a place where we're being divisive. Let's meet in the middle. That's my that's what I'm offering to be meet in the middle.\nSpeaker 10: One person is saying January, another person is saying August, meet in the middle. Is that possible? There's no substitute substitute right now. You have a substitute. You can change it to meet in the middle. If I hear from Councilmember.\nSpeaker 0: Actually, just to clarify, let me clarify. I have the.\nSpeaker 10: Floor.\nSpeaker 0: There. No, let me clarify that. Is this a substitute substitute motion? There was a substitute motion by Councilwoman Mongeau.\nSpeaker 10: I understand we're talking about the substitute.\nSpeaker 0: Which has a sup which has a second.\nSpeaker 10: It has a second.\nSpeaker 0: It does have a second.\nSpeaker 8: It does. But I'm still listening, though. I am still listening, thinking I'm sorry I don't have.\nSpeaker 10: The I want to get to a place where honestly there's going to be a discussion about the international airport and we will have to take an up and down vote on it. And what we're talking about right now is whether we have when we take that vote between August and January and honestly, the ninth District, I said\nSpeaker 10: it earlier, we're not in the flight path. I want to be neighborly. I think there were some good concerns today about the fourth District not being seated. I would hate for those things to happen. I feel that everybody on the council here feels the same way.\nSpeaker 10: So what I'm trying to get to is I want to debunk and get past all the high energy here and get to a compromise. Can you guys meet in the middle?\nSpeaker 8: Mr. Mayor, may I just give a quick response to that?\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 8: So what is really important for me is to not stop our learning process and to not stop acquisition of information. That's that's important to me. I'm troubled by our direction that we stop staff from doing their work or the work that I trust them to do.\nSpeaker 8: I have many items on my policy plate that I'm not ready to take a position on today, but my staff is still vetting it. They're not waiting until I'm ready to take a vote and things take years. And so that's my most important aspect to this motion, is not to stop staff work.\nSpeaker 8: I think that's irresponsible.\nSpeaker 10: I understand. So what I'm trying to hope I'm just driving a conversation that hopes hopefully gets to a meeting in the middle and if there's any, that's what I want to get to. If if I'm I hope that we can have that conversation here and then I'm not forced to be in a place where I have to\nSpeaker 10: pick between the airport and the community. I think we can be reasonable and we can get to this point. And and you guys all control the motion. I can take no action right now, which is what I would have done, but I can't take any action.\nSpeaker 10: So this is ultimately up to all of you, and I hope that you get there.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. I may turn this back to the next speaker, which is Councilmember Austin.\nSpeaker 11: Yes. Thank you. And and as I predicted, this would get caught up in the friendlies the most and substitutes and substitute substitutes. And this is normal par for the course for this council. I appreciate the everybody trying to get somewhere.\nSpeaker 11: I want to be very clear. I work for the city of Long Beach. I represent the residents of Long Beach, not Jet Blue. And I'm not compelled to to move their agenda tonight without a sport district representative seated.\nSpeaker 11: This is about process. And what the the current motion fails to do is fails to give the city, the fourth district representative, a voice at the table. The item that I brought forth would. Halt the process. It would wait until there's an election.\nSpeaker 11: But it would also bring this item back before the city council and allow the city council to be part of the discussion in terms of process moving forward. We would give direction there. The way this is now is allow staff to just do what they do, you know, and have their own process without our input.\nSpeaker 11: And I think that's wrong. So I would really ask this this council to step up and understand that that moving forward would be irresponsible and, in my opinion, undemocratic if we were to to vote on it in favor of the substitute substitute motion or the substitute motion.\nSpeaker 11: I want to get back to the original motion and the intent of what we came here to do tonight night. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. I have so I have I have two more speakers. And then we're going to go back to the motions, which of which there are three on the floor. And I will repeat those and make clear clarify those before we move forward.\nSpeaker 0: Next up, I have Councilwoman Mango.\nSpeaker 12: Thank you. Councilmember Richardson, my motion is in the middle. And let me tell you why. My motion gives us information by which we can vet with our community to come back to the council in November, which is between August and January.\nSpeaker 12: And at that time, we can give direction for additional information or not. But what I don't want is for us to come back in 90 days to give direction to the city manager with no more information than we have tonight.\nSpeaker 12: And that's that's where I'm stuck again. I'm not here to advocate for one side or the other. What I'm here to advocate for is information and a place in the middle. And so. If if that met what Councilmember Richardson was thinking and hopefully meets what everyone else is thinking, then maybe we'll vote down the substitute.\nSpeaker 12: Substitute and get to the substitute. Just a thought.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And the final speaker we have council. Council member. You're Ranga. And then we're going to go to the substitutes motions and go down the go down there. So consider your anger.\nSpeaker 5: Okay, so now I'm all confused. No, I'm only kidding. Basically, what it comes down to is not. Whether we continue forward or hold it for longer or cut it shorter or initiate a process or not. What it's all about and what our original motion was or is, because it's still there on the table.\nSpeaker 5: Is to wait until a fourth district representative is seated. At that point, we start the process of informing staff or giving staff direction about how we want to study conducted. It's a council driven process as opposed to a staff driven, driven process.\nSpeaker 5: We provide we provide guidance and direction to staff as to what we want to see in this study. That's why we wanted to have to wait for a election to take place with a person to get seated, to get acclimated, and then once that happens, start giving direction to staff.\nSpeaker 5: What we want to see in the study, whether it's what's the effects going to be on the noise ordinance, what the effect is going to be in the flight, on the number of flights, all of that. Because that fourth district representative is going to have to have all that information in order to make a responsible, sound, informed\nSpeaker 5: decision. And if we and if we say that, okay, we do it now. Start the process now. That's a staff driven process. That's not what we're after. What we're after is a council driven process. And that's where we have to take control here behind these, not over there, with all due respect to my colleagues.\nSpeaker 5: So that's where I want to go back to my origin. Our original motion is to wait for the 90 days. If it's 60, fine, but 90 days after the person is seated so that that individual can become part of the process and helping to direct staff how we want the study conducted.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And I. I have one. I think I have one final person cued up. And then, Councilor Richardson, did you queue up again?\nSpeaker 10: So. That's right. I'm the guy who didn't want to talk about this. So. So. So I'm just I'm. I won't. I hoped that we got to a place that it was like a meeting in the middle, because at the end of the day, like, the council is going to have to vote on this how to vote on\nSpeaker 10: this airport, the motion that's on the floor. It doesn't take me where I want to go. I'm not going to be supporting that motion. And and I think so. I'm not going to be supporting that. And I appreciate Councilmember Mungo's suggestions.\nSpeaker 10: I would be open to considering that if, you know, I, I want to get to that point where we can talk about it, because it seems like there's been like maybe one or two people talking compromise, maybe three people in the council talking compromise.\nSpeaker 10: And we need to at least I think there's there's some entrenched sides here. And I think we need to get to the folks in the middle to make this motion. So that's where I want to be. So I won't be supporting the motion on the floor.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Now I'm going back to I have I have summary low and thought of cued up. There you go.\nSpeaker 8: So if I hear you correctly, Rex, I think you're right. There are several of us here and probably all of us that would like to work toward a compromise. This isn't something that should be. Bare minimum votes. And so I'm willing to withdraw my motion and I will be supporting Councilmember Mango's substitute motion.\nSpeaker 8: Can I do that, miss?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 8: We're just. We're.\nSpeaker 0: Madam Clerk. We're going to go ahead and withdraw the. The substitute. Substitute? And now we have a substitute motion on the floor, which is the manga motion. Okay. Correct. Okay. I'm going to restate it for you forward. Vice President, are you out?\nSpeaker 0: Do you have anything additional?\nSpeaker 8: No. So it doesn't have names next to the substitute, do they? Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Mongo and Lowenthal. Okay. Thank you. Now, I'm going to go before I move on to Councilman Price, who's next cued up. We are on the substitute motion and I'm going to have Mr. Sinatra. Do you want to repeat the motion for the council?\nSpeaker 4: MAYOR Members of the council. The substitute motion, I believe, made by Council District five and second by Council District two was to direct the city manager to begin the study immediately. And that process would take approximately five months at the conclusion of the study.\nSpeaker 4: The study would then be provided to the Council in a memo form to be published on the city website and then would be brought back to the council 60 days after it's published.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's the substitute motion on the floor. I do have a short speakers list. I'm going to get through that. Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 6: I guess the trouble I'm having is.\nSpeaker 2: What.\nSpeaker 6: Are we foreclosed from doing? Outreach with our communities if we wait 60 days or 90 days? I mean, I guess that's what I don't understand. So for me, I feel like the staff is going to be doing their work.\nSpeaker 6: And unless I've missed something, it's not like they're going to be reporting back to us regularly such that we have this updated information. I think they're saying it's going to take them about five months to do their study and their their research and what they have to do.\nSpeaker 6: So I don't know that we would have actual, tangible information any way to do outreach with the community. So for me, you know, I would like to do outreach with the community as well. I just you know, in the big scheme of things, I just don't think we're talking about that much time.\nSpeaker 6: And I've communicated this to people that are proponents of moving this forward is that I don't know that this is the battle that's worth the fight right now, because all we're asking for is a little bit of time to allow the fourth district representative to be involved in the process.\nSpeaker 6: Let's say, for example, that staff starts this process and there is a legitimate concern or idea. I mean, sometimes my council colleagues have great ideas that I didn't think about. They're brilliant in many ways. And so and sometimes they highlight things that I would have never thought about.\nSpeaker 6: Let's say our new councilperson has an idea or thought of something they'd like the staff to explore or look into that they know is going to affect them. Or of course, they'll have the opportunity to do that after the study is done.\nSpeaker 6: But to me, it makes sense for them to be involved in the process like we are. We're all involved in the process together. And so I don't think we're foreclosed from doing outreach and doing that meaningful community outreach when we if if we wait.\nSpeaker 6: That's that's all I'm saying. I might be missing something here. I just I guess what I'm and perhaps it's because I don't know the history. To me, it seems like this is not an unreasonable request for for a delay.\nSpeaker 6: I just it seems reasonable to me under the circumstances. So with that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Austin.\nSpeaker 8: Starting the work.\nSpeaker 11: Again. I'd just like to first of all, thank all of the people who have endured and stay with this all night here. Obviously, this is an important issue and the council is giving it the the time it deserves and the thought it deserves moving forward.\nSpeaker 11: I'm going to go back to the original intent here. And again, I think council member Urunga summed it up best. This is a we're trying to accomplish a council driven agenda here on on anything moving forward with the customs facility at Long Beach Airport.\nSpeaker 11: Again, the staff has been working on this issue for close to two years. There has been feasibility studies that I see you shaking your head. Council, I mean, City Manager West. Can you tell us how much has been currently committed in terms of resources to to to this to this to this effort?\nSpeaker 5: I can't tell you entirely, because the resources committed.\nSpeaker 4: Were back in October and November of.\nSpeaker 5: 2013, as I mentioned, because we had so much on our plate after we brought the memos to the city council's attention regarding the work that Mr. Rodriguez was doing with Jet Blue. I personally made the decision because our workload was so tight to just stop this until we until we had some time to put some time into\nSpeaker 5: it, get to the city council. At that time, Mario then decided to leave. I pointed Reggie Harrison with the same direction to not engage JetBlue, not to process this. So I can affirmatively tell the city council with, with all due respect, that no work on this has been done since November 13.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. Well, that's what we're showing. And thank you for that clarification. There was a feasibility study done. There was a consultant hired to do that feasibility study. That feasibility study is available as public record as I believe. And so to to satisfy somebody's insatiable quest for knowledge that our council and council colleagues may have.\nSpeaker 11: There is some information out there and there has been work done. Again, we are trying to get to a point where this is a council driven situation where we can eliminate all of the the the the the conspiracies out there.\nSpeaker 11: We can do this in a transparent way. The process will be clear. And so, therefore, I'd like to offer a substitute substantive motion to incorporate the original motion, but ensure that. That after 60 days the city council can provide is is in a position where after 60 days the city council can provide city manager direction on how\nSpeaker 11: to proceed forward with the request for international customs facility.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Mr. City, attorney.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor and members of the council that I don't see any distinction between your original motion, which requires the city manager. Well, let me.\nSpeaker 11: Clarify let me clarify that. Let me clarify myself. The two steps to motion will ask for 67 days as opposed to 60.\nSpeaker 4: That that wouldn't be a substantial change in order to make it. Well.\nSpeaker 11: The original motion was 90 days. So I think the substitute substitute motion incorporates the friendly and we'll days to 60 days.\nSpeaker 4: The question on the floor would have been, had you already accepted the friendly amendment and you had he mentioned a couple of times he.\nSpeaker 0: Has not accept the fact. No.\nSpeaker 6: Can I be heard on that?\nSpeaker 0: Real quick. Just real quick. So I'm sure there's a back over to the person who has the floor. But that fully amendment was not accepted by the councilmember yet. Councilmember Austin, Susie Price had a point of view. Do you have a point of order?\nSpeaker 6: Well, I do, actually. When I originally made the friendly councilman, Austin accepted the friendly at that time. And as he did, he talked about how when he and Councilman Councilmember Urunga were discussing this agenda item, they talked about the 90 days, but that they weren't completely I'm in court all day long so I can transcribe things like\nSpeaker 6: it's nobody's business. He talked about how they they have they talked about the 90 days. They weren't tied to the 90 days. They thought that that was overly ambitious and that 60 days seemed reasonable. In my opinion, that was an acceptance of the friendly when then we did some confusing things.\nSpeaker 6: But when it came back to him, he said, I want to hear from the rest of the council. By that point, he had already accepted the amendment.\nSpeaker 0: Well, just Mr. City Attorney. I was under the impression that he did not accept the friendly amendment.\nSpeaker 11: But we can roll the tape.\nSpeaker 4: I don't think we need to roll the tape, but I think that I wasn't clear on whether it was accepted. I respect Councilwoman Price's position, but I think it was he wanted to hear it.\nSpeaker 11: I wanted to hear additional comments before I accepted their friendly stance.\nSpeaker 4: So that so the difference, as I understand the substitute substitute motion now incorporates the friendly it requests the further direction from the City Council, which was already in your original motion and changes it from 90 days to 60 days.\nSpeaker 0: And the subsequent change, in my view, is that 90 to 60 days of the motion.\nSpeaker 4: So that's correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We're going to go through the motions. There is a substitute substitute motion that is essentially Councilmember Austin's main motion with the change from 90 to 60. Okay. Then we have a substitute substitute motion, which is the mongeau motion, which begins a process today or at this time, but then waits until 60 days after to come back\nSpeaker 0: to it, to come back to council for more direction. And then there's the main motion, which is the motion that we have before us, which is back to 90 days. All right. Those are the three motions on the floor.\nSpeaker 0: We're going to go ahead now. Go to two votes on these motions. Madam Clerk, are you. Are you correct? You ready? Okay, so on the substitute substitute motion, please cast your votes. This is the motion by Al Austin.\nSpeaker 0: Council member, Austin.\nSpeaker 1: Every motion carries for three.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So the motion. The motion carries. Okay. All right. So now just just just to be clear. The City attorney. So I want to be sure everyone's issue like this is important that where everyone's on the same page.\nSpeaker 0: So do you want to repeat what past?\nSpeaker 4: Certainly, Mayor, members of the council, the substitute substitute motion passed 4 to 3 to withhold any action by the city manager until 90 days are until 60 days after full representation or until the 60 days after the fourth District Council person is seated, at which time the city manager will come back to the City Council for additional\nSpeaker 4: direction on the study for regarding a customs facility.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And what I want to just say, I know I haven't had a chance to say any comments. I want to make sure that a few things. One is, I want to thank everybody for coming out. I know this is an incredibly important issue to a lot of people, and it's important for us to hear all\nSpeaker 0: points of view on any issue before the council. And so I know it's contentious. I know it's emotional. I know that for a lot of you, you've been in this in this airport conversation for a very, very long time.\nSpeaker 0: That dates back before anybody was here, sat on this current council. So I understand that. And I also think it's important. I think staff understands that this is obviously clearly an incredibly important topic to a lot of folks, not just some of the council colleagues, but people in the community.\nSpeaker 0: And so as we move forward through this process, I think, Mr. West, the more that there's an opportunity to check in and provide, you know, public check ins about what the where the process is and where things are going, I think will serve everyone to ensure that people feel that there is a transparent process.\nSpeaker 0: And what I don't want what I don't want to happen is I don't want because listen, our staff works very hard and they have a lot of issues, not just this one that they're working on every single day.\nSpeaker 0: And they're also sometimes trying their best to get things done and bring information to the council and bring information to me as well. And what I want to make sure also is this is I think the more transparent we are in this process, I think it's not just better for the community, but it's Mr. West it's better\nSpeaker 0: for staff as well. I think everyone it's out it's out there and everyone gets a an even look into what's going on. So thanks again for coming down. We have a process and Madam Clerk, we're moving on. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 2: Item. Yeah, we're.\nSpeaker 0: We're going to go to item 24 after a quick take a quick recess. So the one minute recess for a restroom.\nSpeaker 13: I'm going to roll the tape.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\nSpeaker 13: I want to know.\nSpeaker 3: How you do it. You know. Oh, my God. So I could.\nSpeaker 4: Like. I was going to ask her. She knows.\nSpeaker 3: Everything. But anyway.\nSpeaker 5: Here is your time.\nSpeaker 3: You're doing all right. Oh, we love. I got the answer. Okay, so we're just like, Hey, we let it go.\nSpeaker 10: I want to catch.\nSpeaker 3: So I would conclude. I need to find out.\nSpeaker 5: When they we're allowed to go.\nSpeaker 4: Back here and talk to Mr. Brady. All right. Issue.\nSpeaker 3: Should.\nSpeaker 13: I have no idea what we're like.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Yeah. So there. Because I know I be able to hear. I just didn't want. Well. A better way. Yeah. I feel like. Yeah. So are you. Do you? Really? Oh, yeah. I feel like I'm going to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Be. Yeah. Where? People like you don't want. You got it right? No, not all. Well. It's not the.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Why don't we go and back into session so I can have the council grab their seat?\nSpeaker 3: I would be like. Pretty.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 1: Would you like me to take a roll first? Vice Mayor Lowenthal Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Mongo. Councilman Andrew's Council Member. You Ranga. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson. Mayor Garcia.\nSpeaker 0: I'm here. Thank you. Next item, please.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Recommendation to provide direction on potential measures. Amending the City Charter relating to Charter Section seven, dash three Council interference.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And before I call on my subcommittee, have Vice Mayor John Knox White and Councilmember Tony Day. So I'm going to give just a little intro because it was I who appointed this subcommittee way back on December 18th, 2018.\nSpeaker 0: And I just want to kind of bring us forward from that time. And I realize that by council rules, this counts against my 9 minutes. If any of us need a little more than 9 minutes to complete our comments on this very important topic tonight, I hope the rest of the Council will indulge us.\nSpeaker 0: Anyway, what I said when I was sworn after I was sworn into office as mayor on December 18, 2018, among other things, is that Alameda has so many has so much potential, but also serious issues that we need to address.\nSpeaker 0: Now, I talked about some that I am not talking about tonight, like housing and traffic transportation, but I and I said that I'm confident that this council will not look the other way or kick the can down the road, but will address these issues before us head on in Alameda, the public trust has been shaken by turbulent\nSpeaker 0: events of the past year. We need to restore public trust and make city government more effective. One place to start is by bringing our city charter in line with current day needs and realities. And I had talked to my two council colleagues ahead of time asking if they would agree to comprise this subcommittee, and they graciously agreed\nSpeaker 0: . So I also said that our challenge as a council moving forward will be to focus our talents, strengths and energies. And among the members of this body, there are many and working in the city's best interests. I ask that we set aside perceived differences and do the work that our residents elected us to do because we are\nSpeaker 0: at our best when we find common ground and achieve together what we could never achieve on our own. And then six months later, the Alameda grand jury released a report on its investigation. And among its findings were some violations of the city charter.\nSpeaker 0: But what I want to point I want to make tonight is that tonight we are looking forward. We are not looking back. This is not meant to single out any one or more council members. This is about good governance going forward.\nSpeaker 0: But we the majority of this council also made a commitment to the the grand jury that we would move forward with certain of reforms, that they recommended recommendations. And so in relevant point is the second of four findings that they made and it's referenced in the staff report that was prepared, but it wasn't attached.\nSpeaker 0: And I as an attorney, I would like to see, you know, the basis of the recommendation. So the finding that brings us here tonight and again, we voted on this and the three of us who were able to vote unanimously decided back on July 16, 2019 that so the finding was the city of Alameda Charter fails to\nSpeaker 0: provide enforcement mechanisms when council members and staff violate provisions of the charter, creating uncertainty when such violations occur. That was the finding. The recommendation to that finding was the Alameda City Council must investigate possible charter or municipal code amendments to clarify and strengthen provisions relating to city governance.\nSpeaker 0: The Charter should delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of Section seven, Dash three, as well as outline and enforcement process period, end of sentence. That's why we're here. And we we do happen to have the backdrop of COVID 19 going on.\nSpeaker 0: But we have been working on this for the better part of a year. Well, I mean, the council subcommittee started working in early 2019. So anyway, without further ado from me, which is the I, I, you know, both Councilmember de Ford and Vice Mayor Knox White have contributed to this report who would like to start.\nSpeaker 0: And by the way, as we have been doing with all of our meetings, raise your hand so I can see you. Let me know in. Form when you're done speaking. So I don't accidentally go on to the next speaker who wants to start.\nSpeaker 3: No.\nSpeaker 0: I. Are you okay? Call them every day. So is that pointing it to my friend? Yeah. I love it. All right. You have been delegated advice there.\nSpeaker 2: I appreciate that. My box is right next to yours. Actually pointed at me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. There's a draft in beginning this conversation, and I will turn it over to Councilmember de Thor rather quickly.\nSpeaker 2: I want to give my thanks to our city staff. We have had many, many conversations on this topic, both with both Councilmember Desai and myself, together with our city attorney and city manager. But also I know that both of us have had a number of conversations independently, and I found them always extremely helpful and informative and really\nSpeaker 2: very much help to bring to light and influence the proposal that I will be proposing tonight, which I believe. And I'm actually going to suggest one minor change to it, though, that did come in via public comment to me over the phone earlier in the week.\nSpeaker 2: So essentially after from.\nSpeaker 0: We can hear you.\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry. You were signaling that I couldn't see my microphone, but my microphone was not there.\nSpeaker 3: Oh.\nSpeaker 0: I was adjusting mine.\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no. I thought it was up on my head. Apologies.\nSpeaker 0: So it's kind of like the pitcher and the catcher communicating, I would just say. But.\nSpeaker 2: You know, it's a baseball themed evening, as you mentioned. You know, we've had many recommendations, starting with the Jenkins report. I followed with the grand jury that that we look at the charter and make much clearer what it is that it defines a violation of the city charter as written right now.\nSpeaker 2: You know, I know that I am not alone in coming to the conclusion that the current language of influence in the city manager is so broad that it actually suggests that no council member should ever speak to the city manager without fear of on on any topic related that could possibly be related to purchasing policy or, or\nSpeaker 2: the hiring processes of, of, of appointees, because it essentially just talks about influence. It doesn't actually describe what those behaviors are. So, you know, with looking forward with the recommendations of Jenkins and the grand jury, we identified the book, The City of Oakland and the city of Santa monica have changed their city charters in recent years to\nSpeaker 2: be much more instructive about how to think about this. And actually, I felt that the language was pretty, pretty spot on. There was not a lot of wordsmithing. I will thank the city attorney for his help in meshing the two into what I think is a very clear and understandable language.\nSpeaker 2: The one change I would say, and it does actually follow the the the second part of the grand jury's recommendation is at the end, I do understand that there could be some confusion about the the final sentence of this recommendation, violation of any provision of the section by a member state.\nSpeaker 0: Could could I ask you to slow that down just a little bit? Because I'm trying to take notes. Will you tell us where you are? This is page two of your staff report.\nSpeaker 2: Page three. This is the.\nSpeaker 0: Proposed.\nSpeaker 2: Language. So the final, final sentence of the proposed language.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Violation of any provision of this section by a member of this Council shall be a misdemeanor conviction, of which shall immediately forfeit the office of the convicted member. And I think that given that, you know, after a lot of conversation, the state already provides the remedy for removing a council member.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that one of the issues we had as we were discussing this was we got a lot of feedback of, well, why aren't you taking action? And because the charter is not clear about where that where that remedy exists.\nSpeaker 2: It would be good to just clarify in this last sentence that a violation of of any provision of this section shall be prosecuted as as as identified in state law, which would give us the flexibility that as state law changes, we would we wouldn't have to amend our charter, which I think would not be problematic and then\nSpeaker 2: conviction, and then we can include the conviction of which shall immediately forfeit the office of the convicted member. I would certainly and I'm sorry to our city attorney, that I didn't actually give you a heads up, that I was going to propose this, but I would certainly take his recommendation.\nSpeaker 0: I have a clarifying question. Vice Mayor. Okay. So that violation of any provision of this section by a member of the Council shall be.\nSpeaker 2: It shall be prosecuted as to as identified by state law, by state law.\nSpeaker 0: And if you're going to reference as a code section of state.\nSpeaker 2: Law, I would not know because that could change next week. And then we're going to have to ask the voters to change our charter. So I would just say that the remedy exists as it does today with state law.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So I don't think we need to I don't think every document has to give you every citation. And given how citations change, I think it would be problematic to put that in our our charter.\nSpeaker 0: I imagine we'd want to hear from the city attorney at some point on that day. Got it. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: So that is okay. That is my proposal. Okay. So, Councilmember Davis, I don't know if you wish you would like to present on yours.\nSpeaker 3: Great.\nSpeaker 0: I'll be happy to call on Councilmember Desai.\nSpeaker 3: Great. Well, thank you. It's been a pleasure working with Vice Mayor Knox Wyatt over the months on this item. And thank you very much to Mayor he Ashcraft for appointing us to this subcommittee. And thank you very much to the all of the city council members and in your patience as we move this forward, Laura, if you\nSpeaker 3: can. So the thing that I'm pursuing is I'm not so much emphasizing the issue of. How to strengthen the work, how to strengthen and further and refine the the word influence as it is currently used in Charter Section seven, Dash three.\nSpeaker 3: And what I'm instead focusing on is, oh, they just leave it there. What I'm focusing on is a procedure by which we actually enforce, and it's a city managed procedure by which we remove city council members who violate the first paragraph of seven, dash three.\nSpeaker 3: And what I put together in the staff report seven, Dash three A and seven, dash three B, that would be added on to seven, dash three, which would stay in place. And if you follow through on seven, dash three A and 7-3b, what you end up is with A is a six step procedure to removing a council\nSpeaker 3: member who tried to influence a city manager in hiring decision making. And that procedure? Yep. Scroll up just a bit. Is open and open to the public. And it's also the accused themself can defend themselves and it addresses issues raised in the grand jury report.\nSpeaker 3: And finally, the procedure is one in which people have a say. Okay, scroll up. So I think the mayor said it best stop right there in in quoting the part of the grand jury report as to why we are here tonight.\nSpeaker 3: Scroll slightly up. We are here, especially because we want to look forward and we want to address this part of the grand jury report that is on page 15, and it's that final sentence there. The charter provides neither procedures for investigating procedure violations and nor a method for the enforcement of the charter.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. So that's part of the grand jury that we want to deal with. And the mayor rightfully pointed out that the findings 19 Dash two again addressed the fact that there was a lack of enforcement mechanisms.\nSpeaker 3: That's the findings. And the mayor had mentioned that. And then go ahead, go up on then there is a recommendation and I will if we could stop here. The recommendation is interesting because this is where my success flows out.\nSpeaker 3: Recommendation 19 Dash two I just want to focus in on that last sentence that says the charter should delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of Section seven, Dash three, as well as outline. And that's the keyword outline and enforcement process.\nSpeaker 3: The word outline is in red. I red circled because when you look at what I've done with 7-3a and 7-3b, it is literally an outline as to how to move forward in instances when there are allegations of of a council member trying to insert herself or himself in a city manager's hiring decision making process.\nSpeaker 3: So let's let's see how it's seven dash, three A and 7-3b or A adopted. This is how things would happen. Step one. City manager alleges that city councilmember interference in a hiring decision process that that's a that's available already that exists.\nSpeaker 3: Step two City Council convenes meeting to discuss allegations and if it so decides Ford's allegations to the district attorney for investigation and substantiation of the allegations. Step three If a D.A. accepts the case and then substantiates the allegations, then the D.A. can forward matters to the grand jury.\nSpeaker 3: This is what we do already. This is a process that's in place. Step four If the grand jury accepts the case from the D.A. and itself substantiates the allegations, then it reports back its findings to the city council.\nSpeaker 3: And this is where the new steps pop in. Step five and step six. So the new process that I I'm proposing and especially my 7-3b is that the city council would hold in step five a public meeting to decide if it should call a special election to remove from office of Council Member.\nSpeaker 3: And this is important. To remove from office a council member who the district attorney and the grand jury says has interfered with a city hiring process. If both the district attorney or the grand jury do not substantiate allegations of misconduct, then you can't move forward.\nSpeaker 3: You have to have both, in my view of things. You have to have both the district attorney and the grand jury substantiating the allegations of interference in the hiring. Now, so the City Council on Step five holds this public meeting to decide if they should call a special election.\nSpeaker 3: At step five, the city council could conceivably decide not to move forward with a special election. They could just do something else and couldn't. They could just say, you know what, we've reviewed the information that the district attorney and the grand jury have to say, but for whatever reason, we're not going to move forward with a special\nSpeaker 3: election or. The City Council could move forward with a separate special election, which leaves us open to step six. So the special election occurs and the people decide and there's a little bit if a language there, if the special election occurred in the general election year, then the council can kind of coincide the special election along with\nSpeaker 3: a general election. So what you have here, what I've put together here is kind of a step by step outline as as because that was the literal word for word language from the from the grand jury reports that that the city charter should outline the enforcement mechanisms.\nSpeaker 3: And that's what I've tried to do in my language with regard to 7-3a and 7-3b, just in a nutshell, 7-3a is all about fact finding and the procedure is for fact finding. 7-3b is the procedures for enforcement. So let me just end up by by saying, you know, we all understand why we're here.\nSpeaker 3: We're here because as it's written in the grand jury report on page 29, the external pressure exerted during the fire chief hiring process and resulting actions represent the very conduct that good government advocates were trying to eliminate when the City Charter Amendment Preventing Council of Parents began to pop up throughout the nation.\nSpeaker 3: Cronyism and backroom deals are corrosive and can destroy the public's trust in the fair administration of government. So to the residents who are watching, to the people who have sent this email you have before you tonight, some ideas are put forward by Vice Mayor Knox White.\nSpeaker 3: Valid ideas, by the way, we're both coming from a place of trying to improve and strengthen 7-3. And then you also have my idea. And and howsoever we decide. I know that we as a city are going to come out for the better because we will have made the efforts to improve 7-3.\nSpeaker 3: My hope is to do it along the lines that I had enumerated. But I you know, I think what the vice mayor had put together, it is valid as well. So I just want to thank all the members of the City Council for your patience with us, as well as the public.\nSpeaker 3: And with that, I'll turn it back back to the mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember de. So okay. Who would like to go next? Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, actually, I have a question.\nSpeaker 0: Please.\nSpeaker 3: So to me, go back to the proposed the proposed addition about something about state law, because I don't know if I wrote it down.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, Madam Clerk, do you have that language to read to us? Laura, can you hear me?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, I can hear you. I'm sorry. Which language did you want me to read?\nSpeaker 0: I think the vice mayor's new proposed language that references state law. Correct? Mr..\nSpeaker 3: Yes. The revised last sentence of the proposed amendment to the Charter.\nSpeaker 1: I am so sorry, but I did not get it down. Word for word. John, maybe I can repeat it.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Or do you have it?\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I mean, I would imagine that the vice mayor can do it, since he's the one who came up with it. But I. I think. Vice Mayor, why don't you take it? All right. Violation of any provision, right?\nSpeaker 2: Correct. Yes. So am I apologize. There was violation of any provision of this section by a member of the city council shall be prosecuted, prescribed as prescribed by state law. The conviction of which shall be immediately forfeit.\nSpeaker 0: Be prosecuted.\nSpeaker 3: Prescribed earlier. But. Okay, I.\nSpeaker 0: Get.\nSpeaker 3: It. Thank you for that clarification. I'll wait my turn.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. Next speaker. Well, maybe we have known. It's their public comments. By the way.\nSpeaker 1: We have public comment.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, you know it. Okay. So are any other clarifying questions about the staff report and the amended this amended sentence? No. Okay. Thank you. And, Ms.. Weisinger, how many public comments do we have?\nSpeaker 1: Okay. We have six that have been submitted via email and no one on the line. No one on.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So, Councilor, are we okay with 3 minutes per speaker? I'm seeing nods. So let's do it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The first one is from Kathryn Pauling for Alameda Justice Alliance, which represents the Army as Renters Coalition. Alameda Firefighters. Alameda Progressives. Renewed Hope Housing Advocates and Alameda Labor Cancer Council. Dear Madam Mayor and Council members. The last minute decision to schedule two additional council meetings this week on various aspects of the city charter revision process troubles\nSpeaker 1: us deeply. We don't understand the rush to push forward these changes that have nothing to do with the immediate welfare of Alameda, who are facing a lack of child care for essential workers, unemployment, food and housing insecurity and worries over family, mental health and general well-being.\nSpeaker 1: Furthermore, this is an unnecessary burden on city staff. For example, why is working on the new state program for helping local restaurants and seniors too burdensome for staff? But three meetings are directing work for city staff on recommended city charter language.\nSpeaker 1: Given the small numbers of letters submitted to council, it is evident that online council meetings are not being attended by the usual members of the public. Your insistence on holding three meetings this week on charter amendments is exactly what the public fears in a time of crisis.\nSpeaker 1: Government taking advantage of public distraction to force through major changes. Allen meetings have the right to consider these detailed and important matters when they're calm and secure again. We understand that the item on tonight's agenda involves recommended recommending language concerning the relationship between elected council members and the city manager.\nSpeaker 1: If you must consider this item tonight, the Alameda Justice Alliance supports the language put forward by Councilmember John Knox White, which is informed by existing ordinances in other cities. As we stated previously, our network is ready and willing to roll up our sleeves and work with the council and city staff to put Alameda back to work, supports\nSpeaker 1: seniors and families in transition, reopen and support our small businesses and provide our students with help they need. Sincerely.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. Next comment?\nSpeaker 1: Karen Miller.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Dear Mayor and Council members, I strongly objected to the council considering significant charter changes during the shelter in place orders. I think these issues need to be discussed in open session with the public being able to weigh in.\nSpeaker 1: I realize you may be trying to make an election date date deadline, but matters of this importance should not be rushed through. I ask you to please reconsider your decision to go forward with these changes until the public is able to address you in person and not have a one sided conversation.\nSpeaker 1: We are all having to wait to get on with our lives and this matter is not so urgent that it can't wait as well. Thank you. Regards. And yes, his Dorothy Freeman. Good evening. Making changes to the city charter during a national emergency is not good governance.\nSpeaker 1: The citizens of Alameda are presently worried about things that are of a more urgent nature than these proposals. None of the proposed changes to the City Charter are of such urgent nature that they cannot be delayed until the 2022 national election.\nSpeaker 1: The ability to get proper information out to the public between now and the November election is very much in doubt. Campaigning will be very difficult for any item on the November ballot. We don't even know that our local newspaper will be able to survive this economic downturn.\nSpeaker 1: Not having a local newspaper will inhibit the ability to get pro and con information out. We also know that a return to normal is going to take longer than just removing the shelter in place order. People will remain in turmoil for an extended period as they work to recover from this disruption to every aspect of our lives\nSpeaker 1: . I doubt the changes to the City of Alameda Charter will be high on their list of things they need to be concerned with. I strongly urge the City Council to delay all discussions of charter changes and any plans to place any charter changes on the 2020 national election ballot.\nSpeaker 1: We need to have full participation of our citizens in making these very important decisions regarding item three, a charter items seven, eight and seven be on tonight's agenda. I propose an outside independent prosecutor be used to determine the outcome of any investigation resulting from a councilmembers interference and actions or decisions that are the responsibility of the city\nSpeaker 1: manager, including any department or personnel under the city manager's responsibility. A prosecutor working for the city in the legal department by nature of their employment, cannot be independent. Thank you. And next we have thank you Katherine beer with.\nSpeaker 1: Dear Mayor and Council members, I strongly object to the Council considering significant charter changes during the shelter in place orders. I think these issues need to be discussed in open session with the public being able to weigh in.\nSpeaker 1: I realize you may be trying to make an election date deadline, but matters of this importance should not be rushed through. I ask you to please reconsider your decision and go forward with these changes until the public is able to address you in person and not have a one sided conversation.\nSpeaker 1: We are all having to wait to get on with our lives and this matter is not so urgent that it can't wait as well. Thank you. Regards. Then. Yes. Paul Foreman. On behalf of Alameda Citizens Task Force.\nSpeaker 3: We don't have sound in the public. Oh, sorry.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you for letting us know, Jim. We will momentarily check some levels here. Artie, do you have it up there? You can hear everything. It's okay. We checked Comcast and online and both are working here. Okay. I don't know.\nSpeaker 1: Maybe it was a AT&T issue. I'm not sure.\nSpeaker 3: But it they said it's back. I apologize.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no, thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I got I got a text, too, I think possibly from the same person.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Um. Okay. And, Madam Clerk, if I could just ask you if the video of this meeting and I guess the audio and the video available will be available on our city's website after tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. And the video will be available. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And then, oops, I started the time I need to restart. Okay. This is our fifth commenter, Paul Foreman. On behalf of Alameda Citizens Task Force, we strongly object to council considering amending our charter during the current shelter in place order.\nSpeaker 1: We are even more dismayed by you proceeding with only the scant seven day notice required by law because one many members of the public will not be aware of these meetings and to community organizations such as A.C.T. are being forced to respond to all of these issues in a very short time frame.\nSpeaker 1: Neither Article 7-3 proposal responds to the concerns of Mr. Jenkins as quoted in the subcommittee report. Mr. Jenkins was critical of the broad attempting to influence language of Article 7-3, stating that a council member should be able to discuss the hiring process with the city manager.\nSpeaker 1: He suggests that any amendment clearly define the specific actions that constitute malfeasance. Both Mr. De Saag and Mr. Knox White's proposals contradict Mr. Jenkins. Mr. de Saag maintains the original language of the Article seven. Dash three. Mr. Knox White.\nSpeaker 1: Instead of narrowing the description of the offense, bronze it to prohibit a councilmember to in any manner, directly or indirectly direct request or take part in an appointment, discipline or removal of any person. This language inappropriately muzzles a councilmember from expressing concerns about the employment process.\nSpeaker 1: The final sentence of the Knox Bay proposal appears to suggest an alternate adjudication process to that now established by California law via the civil grand jury in the superior court. He has advised us that this is not his intent.\nSpeaker 1: That being the case, this license is a proposal should be deleted and replaced by language clarifying that the process will be through the civil grand jury and superior court. These remain this there remains an unaddressed major defect in both of the current and proposed charter article.\nSpeaker 1: No process is provided for triggering an investigation of possible malfeasance. We suggest the inclusion of a provision in Article seven, Dash three, that requires the city prosecutor to investigate such an allegation independently of the council, the city manager and the city attorney, followed by filing a complaint with the grand jury if warranted.\nSpeaker 1: The details of how he proceeds can be established by ordinance. We agree with Mr. Desai's proposal to require the district attorney's concurrence in the civil grand jury's finding. This is not required by California law. We also see no basis for Mr. de Sug suggestion of a recall election.\nSpeaker 1: Article 2-7 of the Charter covers the filling of vacancies, so no additional procedure for filling the vacancy is required. And then the next one. Is Jay Garfinkel. Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council. It appears to me that the proposals made by staff regarding the topic of item 7-3 is incomplete and leaves too many details unaddressed\nSpeaker 1: . I don't pretend to have all of the answers, but would respectfully make the following suggestions for the Council's consideration. One For purposes of this policy, the term Council member shall be understood. To include the Mayor to a member of the Council should be precluded from communicating opinions to the city manager, assistant city manager and department heads regarding\nSpeaker 1: hiring, firing and various contracts for service and the purchase of materials. If a council member wishes to express any such opinion, it should be done through and after formal public discussion with him and majority agreement of the Council with the Mayor then doing any subsequent communicating with management regarding the issues discussed.\nSpeaker 1: Three Determine a mechanism defining how an investigation can be initiated for a method of determining guilt or innocence should be defined and the process should be carried out in a public forum. Five If and when a council member, including the mayor, are found to have violated this noninterference policy, he or she shall immediately be removed from office\nSpeaker 1: and shall be precluded from running for and holding elective office in the city. Six The policy should address a mechanism for replacing a removed council member. And. Yes. That is all.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And that's all the public comment.\nSpeaker 1: Correct. Well, Mr. Garfinkle just emailed again and added two more I think. He added a seven and eight that might have been cut off from his previous. Can I read the last one?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And I think we're still within the 3 minutes, aren't we?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we had one minute and 40 seconds left, so it's just too slow.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yes. Is that I'll add on Barea?\nSpeaker 1: He had number seven involving the county and or incorporating elections. Has a significant potential for inappropriately delaying the process of removing a guilty party. Eight. Deferring to state law is neither required and unnecessary, and doing so removes control from the Alamy citizens.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, and I just got one more forwarded to me to read into the record now.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, please.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Last night I watched the city council meeting broadcast on Comcast Channel 15. Oh. Oh, thank you, Sean. There were multiple interruptions in the sound. Some silences were only for a few seconds, but enough to blot out all or part of what a council member was saying.\nSpeaker 1: Another time, the sound was completely missing when the city clerk read two letters intended for public comment at the beginning of the meeting. Those letters have not been heard and should be reread in a previous council meeting. There were even more serious sound problems blotting out large parts of the meeting.\nSpeaker 1: I understand that the governor has approved teleconferencing for city council meetings, but I believe he is assuming that a city's technol technology is working so that all of the meeting can be heard. This is not the case in Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: Therefore, these meetings are not completely transparent and are very frustrating for the viewers. In addition, I am disappointed that the Council has seen fit to call two special meetings on topics that are not emergencies. Tonight's and tomorrow night's.\nSpeaker 1: Tomorrow's meetings are scheduled for what is a common dinner time, which will make it less likely for many people, especially those with children, to watch. Furthermore, neither of these meetings have been noticed as often or as widely as other special meetings usually are, and they are occurring back to back with a regular council meeting.\nSpeaker 1: I believe these factors will greatly reduce the public's attendance. I could understand the urgency for these special meetings if the council was considering emergency ordinances or relief for the current health and financial emergencies. But this is not the case.\nSpeaker 1: While not emergencies, these agenda items are important and should be presented in time and in a venue where public participation can be easily made. I understand that the Council has to move forward with the city's business even during extraordinary times.\nSpeaker 1: But the way the city of Alameda is going about this right now is to sacrifice transparency. And I believe this is not in the spirit of the Sunshine Ordinance. And that was Tony Grim. Did I say that at the beginning?\nSpeaker 1: I apologize.\nSpeaker 0: No, but I think we got her her email earlier today, so I recognize that. Okay. Any further public comments, Madam Kirk? No more now. And you've checked all the different sources. The email, the text, the voicemail. Yeah. Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Just checked them all.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Well, with that, we will close public comment. All right. And we will open council discussion. Council. Vice Mayor Knox White.\nSpeaker 2: Happy to start things out fairly quickly. So thank you. Thank you very much again for the opportunity to present this to you. And I do look forward to hearing your comments. I did want to just I thank Councilmember Desai for his comments and his considered approach as well.\nSpeaker 2: You know, I do know that at the beginning of this process, I did want to highlight we did talk a lot about how we might be able to move forward with additional. But I would say the additional removal processes and through that process found that there were just you know, there are no cities that have a there\nSpeaker 2: there are no existing places where councils put recalls on the on the ballot, etc.. And at least for me, after talking to our city attorney's office here, of course, because there have been no court challenges, because these do not exist, one cannot say whether or not something will or will not be held up in law.\nSpeaker 2: I would be afraid that by adding something that essentially circumnavigate circumvents the district attorney's and grand jury process which are set up the city. The district attorney doesn't actually make a finding and tell the grand jury recommends that they take it to court.\nSpeaker 2: The district attorney offices just prosecutes that. So for the district attorney to make a recommendation to or sorry to come to a finding would mean that that district attorney had already prosecuted this and the court had already decided that something had happened and that would end up in removal, because that is that is the current law.\nSpeaker 2: So I do believe that another reading of outline in the process for removal is also covered by being very clear that there is already a process for move on and so on as we point to that, so that it's clearer in the future so that people don't believe that, you know, people on the dais can just decide\nSpeaker 2: to vote people off the island or which I know is not councilmember recommendation at all, but it it has been one that has been emailed to us many times over the last year and a half or else, you know, circumnavigating the recall process, which, you know, we know that there's at least one individual to have tried to\nSpeaker 2: foment recalls around the last the last issue multiple times and not been able to collect the signatures to do that. So I think we have the the proper protections and the proper process in place. And I think if we can follow the rest of the recommendation to clarify things, I think we'd be in good standing.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor, if I could ask a clarifying question. I'm going back to the suggestions that Mr. Garfinkle made that that the language should also address the mechanism for replacing a removed council member. Did you and Councilmember Defoe contemplate that?\nSpeaker 2: I speaking for myself, we did not. I mean, the charter already prescribes how we replace it when somebody is removed from office. If it's within, I think it's 180 days. That is the the next highest vote getter.\nSpeaker 0: True.\nSpeaker 2: Outside of that, then the council appoints that person. So I would I believe that is already covered and doesn't need a special process.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, I think that's a that's a good reminder. Okay. Okay. Anything further?\nSpeaker 2: Over.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right. Now, who has to go next? I know. Okay. Councilmember Desai.\nSpeaker 3: I do have 29 seconds, so I don't know if I have to, like, talk speedy quick, but, um, the first thing I want to say is, um, I actually like the language of 77-3 as is indeed the literal reading of seven.\nSpeaker 3: Dash three. Is that a council member? Cannot talk with the city manager about specific persons who they think should be hired or about specific companies that they think the city manager should hire. I'm comfortable with that. That's always been my.\nSpeaker 3: I do believe that there should be a bright line separating.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Councilor Desai, I'm going to have to stop you here because we. I'm reasonably sure the city clerk is reminding me. Oh, and my video has frozen a couple of times. Okay. Wasn't just my present expression. The council will have to vote to allow extra time.\nSpeaker 0: I am going to propose that because I think this is an important topic that really requires and deserves thoughtful discussion and may not be able to be contained in 9 minutes. So could we vote to allow everyone up to.\nSpeaker 0: What do you think? Five extra minutes. Hold up. Fingers. Whatever, Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, I'd be inclined to allow the presenters more time since they presented, but I mean, I think I should be able to speak in less than 9 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah. And I like that suggestion too. It's just that based on those council rules that I think you and I put together. So do you want to say a specific number of minutes or. Oh, I'll make a motion that the presenters get three additional minutes, and if they need more than that, we can discuss adding more\nSpeaker 0: time to everybody. Okay, 3 minutes for now. Do you have a second?\nSpeaker 2: Second.\nSpeaker 0: I saw Councilman Brody's two fingers at every second. Maybe we have a roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember de SAG.\nSpeaker 3: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Not quite.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: I. Vela. I may or as the Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 0: By night.\nSpeaker 1: Carries by five eyes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, so we are resetting your clock. Councilmember decide.\nSpeaker 3: Well, thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Well, we. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: I am comfortable with the language that's in the city charter now that basically says council members can't talk with a manager when it comes to hiring specific individuals by name or when it comes to hiring specific companies. I believe that the reason why that that came into being is historic in nature, because during the progressive era of\nSpeaker 3: the 1920s, we wanted to move away. We want to have professional form of government to move away from the type of influence that had been going on in Tammany Hall back in New York City and in many other cities.\nSpeaker 3: So I think that's why we have that kind of very overly broad language. It's meant to be a catch all. And that's basically the lens by which I see this whole thing. I don't think the issue is to to define away the term influence as it is currently now in the city Charter seven.\nSpeaker 3: Dash three. Now I agree the special election that I suggest is indeed a unique animal, potentially subject to challenge. But by virtue of being a city charter, I'm going to have to believe that city cities like Alameda, that we can create our own rules because we are a charter city.\nSpeaker 3: But the reason why the special animal, the special election came into being is because the grand jury had indicated in page 29 that they had the power to remove the page 29 of the grand jury report, that they had the power to remove a council member for malfeasance.\nSpeaker 3: But they decided not to do it because they wanted to respect the will of the voters. And so my way of addressing the issue of respecting the will of the voters was to create this special election, because that, in effect, would be a decision made by the voters.\nSpeaker 3: I understand I will summarize by saying, I understand that this is a unique animal that I am proposing. But I also think, though, that what Vice Mayor Knox White has put together is also something that we could work.\nSpeaker 3: It would be an improvement on 7-3. So either way, I think we're going to come out of this on the better side.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. With 44 seconds to go, Councilmember Vela's hand is up. Councilmember Vela. So a few things. First, I am not a mayor. You started off by talking about public trust. And I do think, you know, I want to acknowledge our constituents that have raised issues about having this meeting as well as tomorrow night's meeting.\nSpeaker 0: And I think that if we're trying to build trust, I want to acknowledge that and acknowledge the fact that regardless of how we may feel, we have constituents that feel that this is happening without giving enough time for people to weigh in.\nSpeaker 0: I want to acknowledge the digital divide and the fact that some people don't have Internet at home, some people don't have the technology to follow these meetings. I want to acknowledge the fact that people aren't getting the word of mouth that they used to get by going to the senior center and seeing each other for lunch or\nSpeaker 0: being able to run into each other on Park Street or at the coffee shop. So I do want to make sure that whatever we do that we give that time and that ability for people to weigh in. I think that it's important.\nSpeaker 0: I think that that's why those meetings in June are particularly important. And I think that that that needs to be shared with our constituents and that there isn't going to be a decision, I would hope tonight to say, let's go put this on the November ballot.\nSpeaker 0: But I think that that's a message that needs to be shared and put out there. And certainly that's not my intent to make that type of decision tonight. I do feel that this measure is very different from the other charter provisions that have in terms of charter proposed charter changes that have have been put forward.\nSpeaker 0: The reason I think that this is different is that I think we're all in unanimous agreement that out of all of the provisions, this is the one that a couple of outside parties, whether it be Mr. Jenkins or the grand jury, have acknowledged needs changing and should be changed.\nSpeaker 0: And for that reason, I feel comfortable having this conversation tonight, at least as a starting point, and perhaps we'll have more conversation in June about timing and whatnot. A couple of other things. You know, I and I think this needs to be said, not all people that are indicted by a grand jury are found guilty at trial\nSpeaker 0: . Not all people charged by a district attorney are found guilty. Somebody who's worked in a DA's office and prosecuted cases along with my sister, who is a district attorney, I can tell you, well, there's value there when they don't take every case to trial.\nSpeaker 0: They settle things out. They might charge somebody with a higher offense and that person might bleed out. But there's a whole process in place where evidence gets turned over. There's hearings. There's what we would call due process. There would be an opportunity to cross-examine an opportunity for representation by the accused party.\nSpeaker 0: I think that all of those things are very important. And I think in politically heated environments, that's especially important, especially in light of the fact that elections and the political voice is one of the most protected forms. I think it's the most protected form of free speech.\nSpeaker 0: And certainly I would say that one's right to vote is a manifestation of that expression of free speech. So I would be very uncomfortable trying to overturn the will of the voters through a democratic process by writing into our charter something that would usurp political voice of our constituents.\nSpeaker 0: I find the right to vote to be very sacred, and I think we need to uphold it and preserve it to the extent possible. So I would not be comfortable doing something that's going to undermine that. I would also say that there have been a number of how do I put this, a number of cases of political\nSpeaker 0: intrigue that have happened over the years. There was a council member that broke into another council members office. That council member didn't cooperate with police and was not removed from office. And there have been other instances where there were allegations, you know, of, you know, I think that council member was eventually there was a conversation potentially around\nSpeaker 0: some sort of censure or something like that. But I don't think the council can move forward with that is that, you know, that happened when I was a younger. There were also instances where there were allegations about previous council members meddling.\nSpeaker 0: With police officers where there were allegations of drunk driving on behalf of their partner. So I just I think there is always going to be political intrigue, but I think that our charter needs to stand up to constitutional muster.\nSpeaker 0: And in that respect, I think we need to be very thoughtful about what goes into it. Well, we are a charter city, and we can. We can. There's a number of areas where we can legislate. There's also a number of areas that are precisely and explicitly carved out under the Constitution of the US and the state of\nSpeaker 0: California. And I think we need to be mindful of those. I do. I do. Like Councilmember Knox White. Vice Mayor Knox white proposal. A couple of things that I think could be added to add further clarity. I like the point that the mayor should be named with.\nSpeaker 0: I think that needs to happen. I think that we need the mayor in other places. Yes, the mayor is a member of the council, but that can be confusing. I see the mayor nodding. Yeah, I know it's not this mayor that we're including, but the term.\nSpeaker 0: I think it's. No, that's absolutely right. Yeah. And I think the other thing is that we need to get rid of the gendered term. That's, you know, language that I think we should change throughout. And if we're going to update this section, I think we should think about that as well.\nSpeaker 0: But I'm willing to support the vice mayor's proposal. I do think that the term influencing is very overbroad. And I to that point, I do want to raise this example. As council members, we get contacted all the time by various vendors who who may want to talk to the city or talk to somebody at the city.\nSpeaker 0: Most recently, I was contacted by somebody that I knew about testing. It's not to say that I want the city to contract with these individuals, but I also know that our staff are looking for some of these contacts.\nSpeaker 0: Is it influencing for a council member to forward this and say why nothing else? I think influencing can be deemed as being that broad. I think that there is a lot of things that aren't necessarily ill intended that could fall under influencing, and that certainly, I think, don't necessarily get in the way of the day to day\nSpeaker 0: . Now, if I was on the board of that company or anything else, I think obviously that would be or somehow set to gain by that company or any other company. Obviously, that's what we're trying to get at. We're trying to get at situations where a council member can profit or benefit financially in some way.\nSpeaker 0: And so I think that dealing with that word influencing is very important because of those scenarios. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Councilman Brody.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam Mayor. I want to thank the my two colleagues for putting in the time to do this and recognizing the comments of my colleague, Ms.. Vella, and the issues arising for why we're here are two and a half years old now.\nSpeaker 3: So what I understand and totally agree for the most part with all of the comments about considering charter revisions, I mean, this is not this is not a new thing. This is something that, you know, we've been expecting.\nSpeaker 3: So and I also appreciate the mayor's framing remarks in the beginning. This is about moving forward. So I'm going to try to frame my remarks around moving forward and not looking backward. So I appreciate the clarification in the last sentence of the proposal by the Vice Mayor, but I want to focus on what I think is probably\nSpeaker 3: the most important sentence in that in this proposal, is that the city council may further implement this section by ordinance resolution or rules of conduct. And we had had, I believe, in response to one of the grand jury recommendations, which I would have supported had I voted, but I didn't.\nSpeaker 3: We are in the process of developing a code of conduct. So I think when this is brought back for approval, in order for the public to see the big picture, we need to bring back that code of conduct, because the code of conduct, you know, outlined the levels of inquiry and it outlined the levels of, for lack\nSpeaker 3: of a better word, discipline for both board commission members and members of the city council. So I think that, you know, keeping those together, I think, are critical to having the public understand that we take this seriously. And, you know, we are implementing the recommendations of the grand jury and doing it in a way that improves our\nSpeaker 3: city government. So just a couple quick comments on the other. Let me just pull up my. Sorry. We're a little bit slow. You know, we see this a lot at the national level. And, I mean, it's easy for, you know, all of us who have like minded, like minded political beliefs and opinions to kind of get in\nSpeaker 3: a room together and sharpen our pitchforks and, you know, come up with all sorts of grandiose ideas and schemes and and plans. And but thankfully, our Constitution exists to control the, you know, the worst impulses of politicians. And, you know, we can be thankful that it's been used effectively in Washington to control, you know, the worst influences\nSpeaker 3: of the person who sits in the White House. And I appreciate, you know, the Constitution. And, you know, the one thing the Constitution has, you know, is a due process clause. And, you know, I could, you know, probably read it or or, you know, talk about it.\nSpeaker 3: But, you know, Edward Murrow, I think you all know he was a journalist. And, you know, one of the people that fought against the you know, when the McCarthyism Red Scare was and, you know, he just made a comment that we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction of, geez, my daughter's calling me\nSpeaker 3: . And right in the middle of the best part.\nSpeaker 0: Which she's not watching.\nSpeaker 3: Well, it's her phone popped up on the other one. That's the one that lives here.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay. Well, my.\nSpeaker 3: I guess I lost my place. He said that we we must always remember that accusation is not proof, and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. And one of the weaknesses in the alternative proposal is that there's a mechanism to remove somebody just based on an accusation.\nSpeaker 3: And I think everyone in this room knows that the power of the district attorney is to accuse and that, you know, it's a court that has to convict. And as customer Abdullah said, you know, there are often many times where the district attorney will accuse and a person turns out not to be guilty.\nSpeaker 3: And the same with the grand jury. I mean, they're they're their task is to look at evidence, to see if the burden of proof is to accuse somebody or accuse the organization or or do whatever. So I want to keep that in mind.\nSpeaker 3: And, you know, to issue on the recall, I just want to go back to, you know, of all things that Jenkins report, because I think that Mr. Jenkins, uh, you know, the more that I read this report, you know, I haven't looked at it for a while, but, you know, the more I appreciate that report and a\nSpeaker 3: lot of the things that were said in there, so know he talked about he quoted a case, I think it was Washington versus something he said the right to hold public office either by election or appointment is one of the most valuable rights of citizenship.\nSpeaker 3: And he went on and said in California, again quoting a case, The right to hold public office has long been recognized as a valuable right of citizenship. In 1869 and people, the Washington Supreme Court declared that, quote, The elected franchise and the right to hold public offices constitute the principal political rights of citizens of the several states\nSpeaker 0: . So he went on and.\nSpeaker 3: Continue quoting The right to hold public office either by election or appointment is one of the valuable rights of citizenship. The exercise of this right should not be declared prohibited or curtailed, except by plain provisions of law. And then when he put that in there, he then followed up with his own commentary.\nSpeaker 3: So I say this not to talk about the rights of any one of us to hold office, but Mr. Jenkins conclusion and and tying those those quotes together, he said the right is not just held by the office holder, but also also by the office holders constituents.\nSpeaker 3: So that's why I, I don't think that an extra statutory recall provision, I think is appropriate because I mean, I've got to say, from my perspective, I know exactly where the line is. And I'm not worried about ever crossing it or ever being accused of crossing it or ever going in a gray area.\nSpeaker 3: But. Somebody might. And I think we have to be careful in the future not to vest political power, because that could be the tyranny of the majority. And, you know, I don't think I'm in the minority now. I think I'm in the majority of a great council.\nSpeaker 3: But, you know, there could be somebody in the future that doesn't have that luxury. And I want to make sure that we protect their rights, not only their rights, but the right of the people that put them there from being kicked out by a majority that may oppose them.\nSpeaker 3: So, again, I appreciate the mayor's comments. I appreciate all the hard work put into this and I appreciate the updates. And I look forward to seeing the the code of conduct because these two, in my mind, go hand in hand.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. And thank you for the signal. Um, so thank you. And I'm glad you raised the code of conduct, Councilmember Odie, because I was thinking of that too, and I was reading through the staff report. I want to quickly say that I agree with my colleagues, Councilmember Vela and Councilmember Odie, about not wanting to see\nSpeaker 0: a recall election be a part of this modification. I think we need to be careful to be as nonpartisan in the greater sense of the word as possible. You never know. And again, we're doing this for the future.\nSpeaker 0: It should not be up to a city council whether or not even after a day and or grandeur, I guess it's day and grand jury finding whether or not to pursue a special election in addition to usurping the right of the voters to choose.\nSpeaker 0: There's a cost to a special election. And man, are we cognizant of costs these days? But even in the best of times there is. So the. Okay. Okay. I'm just getting a text from the city clerk. Madam Speaker, I believe my first time is still correcting.\nSpeaker 0: And then we can.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I just wanted you to know that I didn't want you to feel like this was your time. And I want you to know you had three more minutes after this, but I can't add it till you stop.\nSpeaker 0: No, I knew that. Thank you, though, for the reminder. Okay. All right. So where was I? Okay. So, anyway, I do not favor that. The other thing is, as as Councilmember Guillen noted about the D.A., I would add to that to say that D.A. is especially Alameda County D.A., given the breadth and depth of everything that comes\nSpeaker 0: across their desk, she might not or whoever the D.A. is just might say, I don't have time for this. And that doesn't mean that that isn't something that is worthy of being addressed. But we want to stay away from selective enforcement.\nSpeaker 0: And I also think simpler and straightforward is generally always the way to go when you're when you're drafting regulations that it's easily understood and unambiguous. And I want to just address a couple of things that some of our listeners addressed raised.\nSpeaker 0: And one is that, you know, we're rushing this and why now? I would draw your attention to the fact that there was a direction to this council back in July of 2019, and that was held at a public meeting.\nSpeaker 0: And there was ample opportunity for public comment. And the three of us who were able to vote voted unanimously to accept the findings of the the grand jury. As I further noted about the shortcomings of the Charter with regard to council or staff violating these particular provisions of the Charter.\nSpeaker 0: And also we agreed to investigate and delineate the charter amend so that the charter delineates specific types of misconduct that constitute a violation, as well as outline and enforcement process. And I happen to think that what the the vice mayor came up with, the modified language does just that.\nSpeaker 0: And I think I've heard from everyone, if I was hearing you correctly, that you were in agreement. And so notwithstanding that we aren't meeting in public, this issue came before the public. And so I'm not sure what the public would have us do that we're not prepared to do to more specifically delineate what that misconduct and what\nSpeaker 0: comprises that misconduct and and the the remedy, if that were to happen. And so and and the other thing is this does need to go to the voters again. We expect we respect the right of the voters. This is a charter provision.\nSpeaker 0: It needs to be amended by a vote of the people. We aren't saying, yep, we're going to make that change in the charter. We're saying we will bring that. If we agree, we will bring that forward to the voters.\nSpeaker 0: And notwithstanding our or in light of our discussion last night, we can decide we going to move forward with this and we don't need to spend more time wordsmithing and then we are going to meet in June as we also discussed last night to talk about timing.\nSpeaker 0: But I do want to just add a note of caution because I believe the city manager and I were probably on the same call this morning with county public health are at noon and maybe some of you were.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not sure that June is the magic day for opening up Alameda County, our public health officer. Let it be known that our county is a little more conservative. The Bay Area, I mean, all the Bay Area public health directors are in lockstep and they're a little more conservative than the governor is.\nSpeaker 0: He's the governor of the whole state, and different counties have different situations. With regard to COVID 19, the Bay Area is now we know where the first cases in the nation started. So which is just to say I don't want to hold people's hope out that June is going to be magic.\nSpeaker 0: But that doesn't mean we're not going to keep going forward with city business because we just don't put the city's business on hold. Um, but anyway, I also thank you all, all of you, for your input, for your time.\nSpeaker 0: And I would like to see we have come this far. I think we've done the work we're asked to do and I would like to see us come to some conclusion. I see Councilmember de SAC with his hand up.\nSpeaker 3: I just want to if it's okay, I just want to end by just saying this. I believe that if the D.A. and the grand jury substantiates allegations that a council member exercised cronyism. Then I do believe that people should be able to recall that council member through a special election.\nSpeaker 3: Clearly I don't have the votes tonight for my mechanism. I see that I can certainly read tealeaves. While I won't support councilmember vice mayor language, I won't oppose it either. And I'll just have to deal with it in the coming months.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I would ask your strong reconsideration of that part, that position, Councilmember de SAC. And I fully respect your right to vote however you choose. But you were a part of this subcommittee that was tasked with making the the directed changes to the charter.\nSpeaker 0: And. I. I would like to see your support, but maybe you'll think another minute about this. All right. Any further comments from the council? All right. So here's what we are. Sorry. Go back over. So. Okay. Do we have, um.\nSpeaker 0: So the the recommendation I think is to was to move forward with the recommendations. So do I have a proposal for what recommendation that would be? Vice mayor.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Hey, nobody else jumping up after listening? I think I would propose I would move that with that. We direct staff to come back in June with the rest of the items that end up with whatever items end up being recommended for coming back in June with language that adds the mayor.\nSpeaker 2: So with that with language with the proposed language, I am going to say that I proposed, I guess, for clarifying the language around influence, adding the mayor and city council, although I think that the charter is pretty clear that the mayor is on the city council, but we can always make that clear.\nSpeaker 2: And the the. Yeah, I will certainly take the city attorney's guidance on better wording. But with the the the sentence restructuring violation of any provision of this section by a member of the City Council shall be prosecuted as prescribed by state law.\nSpeaker 2: Conviction of which shall immediately forfeit the office of the convicted member. That would be my.\nSpeaker 0: And I have a clarifying question on the second sentence of your proposed language at the bottom of page two, this sentence that says neither the city council nor any member shall give orders to any subordinates. Oh, you know it it's the from 7-3.\nSpeaker 0: I just looked at the top of the page. Neither the council nor any of the members. So elegant language there. So maybe that's where you would say neither. No member of the city council, including the mayor or what have you.\nSpeaker 0: Do you see that second sentence?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I would propose we yes, I would propose we leave that in the hands of the city attorney to.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, that's fine. Councilmember Bell, I think it's a hand up. Yeah. So I want to second this motion. I did want to clarify with the vice mayor, you said to bring this back in June. I wanted to clarify that that would be at the June meeting on the scheduling, correct.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. We actually had two. One would be which ones do we actually want to move forward with? And then I think about potential scheduling.\nSpeaker 0: Right. So this would be at the second June meeting.\nSpeaker 2: I would bring it back to both so that the guy I my understanding of our emotion last night was that all items that were proposed to move forward would come back so that we could say, here are the four items, or the two items are the one item that we decided to go forward.\nSpeaker 2: Which do we want to move forward and have a conversation about scheduling in the future so that we can actually decide we don't want to move this forward? I don't hear that happening, but I think that in Councilmember de SAC say that he would like to have the opportunity to know everything that's going on and consider them\nSpeaker 2: all and make a determination to that point. And if I thought that that's what we decided last night.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I guess my question is sorry. At the first June meeting, I thought we would also. Well, I feel like we're giving direction about the specific language here. And there is a majority of us supporting that language that could potentially be put on a ballot.\nSpeaker 0: So I guess I just want to make sure that when this comes back in June, we're not rehashing this conversation and that we're really talking about timing as opposed to substance of the proposal itself beyond whatever the city attorney might give us.\nSpeaker 0: And the city attorney has his hand up. So let's hear from him. Councilor Mark.\nSpeaker 3: If I may preview very much with the matter.\nSpeaker 2: If I may suggest.\nSpeaker 3: We would be happy to bring you ballot language when you direct us to bring you ballot.\nSpeaker 2: Language. So if I may suggest that we do.\nSpeaker 3: That, once you've made a final decision that it's going to go forward, then whichever meeting you're going to do. So it sounds like the council will convene in June 1st or second meeting to make a decision on which whether any measures go forward.\nSpeaker 2: And at which.\nSpeaker 3: Election, once you give us that direction, will prompt you bring in promptly bring you back ballot language and with a staff report, which is what we would normally do with the resolution and everything else, if I may, suggested in the June meeting, it would be true, it would be premature for us to bring you a whole bunch\nSpeaker 3: of ballot language that creates confusion. And it's probably unnecessary for you to decide whether you want to move forward with an item or not. But and of course, the timing is that we have to get the councils. If you were to do it this November, we'd have to do it at the second meeting in July.\nSpeaker 3: So there is a little bit of time. So assuming you directed us to do it in the first meeting in June, we'll we'll come back in July with the language for you to amend, modify or put on the ballot.\nSpeaker 0: Sets indicate Councilmember Vela.\nSpeaker 2: I would say that is consistent with what I would.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I was actually going to call him Mr. O.D. because he had his hand up, Councilmember.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I mean, I would be inclined to support direction to actually prepare this language. I mean, this was the original charge of the committee. And, you know, as I mentioned in my comments, you know, this is something that that we've been aware of for quite some time.\nSpeaker 3: So, I mean, I don't know if we have to decide. I mean, maybe we decide this among everything else, but I don't think we need to have a second vote on preparing language. I mean, I don't even know why this would even be an issue about whether or not to put it on the ballot this year, given\nSpeaker 3: that this was the point of the committee. But, you know, I, I would support something that just said bring the language and then, you know, we vote on it.\nSpeaker 0: At all counts. Mr. Chen, would that work with you or for you? Yes. I mean, we absolutely.\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. If the council directs us to bring us bring language back to you ballot language, we certainly will.\nSpeaker 3: Well, you know, we probably would look to do that in the second meeting in June or the first meeting in July.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So what do we think of that, of our councilor Otis suggestion? Councilmember Avella I think the mayor, I guess, yeah. I think, you know, I want to acknowledge what staff is saying in terms of just when they would start preparing ballot language.\nSpeaker 0: So I think for me, I'm fine with with the current motion as is provided that at that first meeting in June, we are not rehashing the substance of we are we are good to go on this option. And if there is language drafted, it's going to be based off of the conversation that we had tonight.\nSpeaker 0: And this motion. To me, what I'm hearing from the vice mayor is essentially the only conversation is the overall timing conversation that would happen at the second meeting in June relative to this provision. And if I guess. If we're making that determination.\nSpeaker 0: I'm also fine with this being on the November ballot. But but but I feel like I've heard my other colleagues suggest that they want to talk about other issues. Councilmember Vela, your time is up, but we can make a vote to give another 3 minutes because there's like I said in the beginning, I do not want anyone\nSpeaker 0: to feel that they didn't have ample time. And you all have some really good suggestions that I appreciate and want to hear fully. Can we can I? I would make a motion that we give everybody another 3 minutes, pass their time.\nSpeaker 0: Account. 30 seconds. May we have a roll call vote, please?\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember de SAG.\nSpeaker 3: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Not quite. I.\nSpeaker 3: Hi. But I have a meeting soon, so.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yeah. Hi. Okay. Continue counseling. So. So. I'm amenable. I think that whatever pathway forward where we can be as united as possible, I'm open to. And if we need to have the conversation on timing together in conjunction with the other provisions, I'm fine with that with in the second meeting.\nSpeaker 0: But I think I heard you say you would be okay with this being on the November ballot. Absolutely. Okay. So so then I because I am also respectful of staff time and how many times we bring an item back to staff.\nSpeaker 0: So that's why I'm just thinking maybe for economy staff time, if we could just give us a direction that you and Councilmember Otis seem to be saying we could do now. But Councilmember I mean, vice mayor next. I do not want to.\nSpeaker 0: Where did you go? Okay. Um, I don't want to. This is your motion. I don't want to hijack it.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I would say that in trying to answer Councilmember Vela's question earlier, her intent was my intent, which was just that it would come back for a quick. Yes, we're moving this forward. Yes, we're putting it on this thing, but that we're not coming back to have a conversation.\nSpeaker 2: So I think that her recommendation is consistent with my intent.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And along with Councilmember Ortiz, that we can give direction to prepare a ballot language and we'll consider it for timing in June, although we've heard.\nSpeaker 2: I wasn't including that. But we can do that. I don't I don't I didn't hear that that was necessary. I think that in June, when we know what we're moving forward, we can give that direction to the staff and they can work on that language.\nSpeaker 2: And at that point, if it's important to give them the direction to work on the ballot language now and bring it back in July, that's fine too.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Vela. Yeah. I just. I also want to be considerate of Councilmember Desai again. I think he had he had talked about wanting to hear about what other charter amendments would be put forward and have that conversation in June.\nSpeaker 0: And I think wherever we can move together, kind of in unanimous agreement of the council and I know tonight he's not necessarily ready to support this. So perhaps that gives another opportunity to have a conversation with him. I'd be open to that.\nSpeaker 0: I'd like to hear from Councilmember De Saag if he thinks he might change his mind. Thank you. Councilmember De Soto there.\nSpeaker 3: Is the possibility of changing my mind. There are some issues that I would certainly love to pursue with the city attorney. Um, and it has to do with getting a comfort level with the language, the new language with regard to enforcement that Vice Mayor Knox White has raised.\nSpeaker 3: Um, and also a comfort level that, um, that we're, that if we move forward with the language right now, that we are not necessarily giving the green light to council members to go ahead and talk with, with the city manager about hiring specific individuals or or so.\nSpeaker 3: I need to know what are the parameters. And I think we can't we can't flesh that out tonight. And so I think I think for me, I think the wise move is to is to abstain and then talk with the city attorney as well as if he.\nSpeaker 3: So if he's open to it, I'll talk with continue to talk with Vice Mayor Knox White.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I'm sure he's willing to continue speaking with you. Vice Mayor, your hand is up for process.\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to withdraw my motion. It sounds like there might be another motion that somebody would like to make.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Over on the other side of my screen, anybody want to make a motion?\nSpeaker 3: I'm actually on a different my screen. A little different than yours.\nSpeaker 0: I know. I know. I, I kind of gather that too, but. Okay, so did somebody want to clarify the motion? I mean, I actually thought you were there. And did we not have a second? Yeah. Councilmember Bell. And I thought you were there.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: If I could just remake the Pacemakers motion with clarity that it would come back in the second meeting in June relative to the conversation on timing. And in the meantime, the staff want to prepare ballot language that would.\nSpeaker 0: That we would consider it. Okay. Is that how we want to word it or how. How are you feeling about and I don't want to talk about Mr. Death. So when he is sitting here. But is. Well, I guess the preparing ballot language and he may be able to come around to support it in June.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Could I ask? But the city clerk and the city attorney, did we give you enough clarity or and the direction? And that's and that's for the vice mayor's revised language proposal and then the inclusion of the mayor, the term mayor and your language city attorney?\nSpeaker 3: I think so. And if I understand correctly, the council will take one more look at this. In the meantime, we might start drafting some draft language, but we won't be bringing it to you for approval in the second meeting in June.\nSpeaker 3: We'll bring it to you in July along with whatever else you want to yet have approved in July. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Agreed. What he said. That was good.\nSpeaker 0: What he said. All right. We have a motion. Do we have a second? Don't be shy, people. We've come this far.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Fine.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Councilmember Ody has seconded it. May we have a roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 1: Council member days are.\nSpeaker 3: At stake for now.\nSpeaker 1: Next light.\nSpeaker 2: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Bella. I may or as the Ashcroft I that carries by four eyes, one abstention.\nSpeaker 0: All right, everybody, thank you. Good job. I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Okay. So we have concluded item three, A and three, and that leaves adjournment. So with that. Thank you, everybody for your time. Um, all the hard work and fight that went into this.\nSpeaker 0: I, i am grateful. All right. See you all soon. Take care. Where are you? Masks wash your hands tonight.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 2: Consider adoption resolution in support of a Congressional investigation regarding the impeachment of President Donald Trump. This item was put on the agenda at the request of Vice Mayor Vella and Council member Odie.\nSpeaker 9: In Las Vegas.\nSpeaker 0: Did you want to speak?\nSpeaker 9: I was going to wait till you recognized me.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I'm sorry, Brody.\nSpeaker 9: I don't want to speak out of turn. So I. Similar to the previous referral, I think the language of the referral speaks for itself. I think we all understand that we cannot impeach the President of the United States.\nSpeaker 9: But similar to the issue with the FAA, you know, there is 65% of the American people think there needs to be an independent prosecutor to investigate the Russia ties and the financial potential financial misdeeds. And we as citizens, I've heard from many of our residents that we also share those concerns.\nSpeaker 9: And we do have, as citizens, through the First Amendment of the Constitution, the right to petition redress of our grievances. And if our representatives aren't listening to us, I think there's no better place to do that. From the grassroots, the ground level, city councils, state legislatures.\nSpeaker 9: And I want to hear what the public has to say on this.\nSpeaker 11: And I join Councilmember Odion bringing forward this referral. You know, I think in a free society, we all have the ability to engage in free speech, to question the actions of government and our elected officials, and to demand transparency and clarity when evidence surfaces that something unethical, illegal or untoward occurs, which is the case here.\nSpeaker 11: And I think specifically in our system of governance, our founders, when they were contemplating what sort of government we were going to have, they were very clear about it. They wanted checks and balances, and so they enumerated a specific power for Congress in the Constitution.\nSpeaker 11: And that power is the power of impeachment. The House has the ability to make that call. And based off of the allegations that are supported by evidence that have been made, you know, the allegations are serious. And they undermined not only our system, but the faith in all of our institutions.\nSpeaker 11: And, you know, at a certain point, we have to ask ourselves if what's the point of a constitution and the ethical standards that we're requiring if they're not being enforced? And so, you know, for that reason, we think it's important.\nSpeaker 11: I think it's important that we take united action in our official capacity as counsel, because I think that that means a little more coming from us as a as a council than just as individual elected officials to ask our representative and all of the federal representatives, because they do all collectively, regardless of party and regardless of whether\nSpeaker 11: or not they represent us directly from our district. They do represent our collective interest and our collective interest in preserving free speech and not chilling it and preserving our system with as much integrity as possible. So I'm also interested to hear from members of the public, but I think that that's why this resolution is so important and\nSpeaker 11: not just an empty action.\nSpeaker 9: And just to close or follow up on the vice mayor's point, I mean, Nixon said it best. I think the American people have a right to know if their president is not a crook. So I pray he's not.\nSpeaker 9: I really do. There's, you know, thousands of political decisions we could disagree with. And this is not really related to any of those political decisions. It's we have a right to know whether there are financial interest violations of the amount annulments clause.\nSpeaker 9: If there are there are so many lies and cover ups regarding the ties with Russia and if there there's a lot of smoke there and every time something happens, somebody gets called in a lot in a lie. So I think we as a public have a right to have that investigated.\nSpeaker 9: And like I said, I pray nothing happens because I really think we don't need a constitutional crisis. But we have a right to know that our president is not a crook.\nSpeaker 0: All right. We have 17 speakers. And I'm going to ask you to hold your applause, because it is now almost 1030. 17 speakers, 3 minutes. Each of you could be here quite a while. Thank you, Rosemary. And we do still have closed session, right?\nSpeaker 0: Memory reset. So, Rosemary Jordan, Alan Machan and then Katherine Cameron. So.\nSpeaker 4: Do now. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Madam Vice Mayor. Council members. Staff attendees. Thanks for hanging in there. My name is Rosemary Jordan, and tonight I'm speaking again as a citizen of Alameda. I'm asking for your support for the resolution calling on Congress to initiate an impeachment investigation.\nSpeaker 4: Some might ask if this action is necessary. Now it is. Since we last addressed the council just two weeks ago, the concerns we identified in terms of fitness for the office, emoluments violations, Russian interference and obstruction of justice have all become more extensive and more serious than on March 4th.\nSpeaker 4: President Trump made serious, unfounded accusations against our 44th president, presenting another potentially impeachable offense. Some wonder if a resolution at the local level is appropriate or even helpful. It is this proposed resolution, like the one passed in Richmond and Charlotte, Vermont tonight and those being contemplated in College Park, Danville, Denver, Littleton, Montgomery County, Nashville, Philadelphia, Savannah, Seattle\nSpeaker 4: and others can help build public support for impeachment, and in fact, may be the only thing that can obligate reluctant representatives to act on behalf of the American people and our system of government over party. You know, Charlotte, Vermont is not too different from Alameda.\nSpeaker 4: It's a beautiful small town on the banks of Lake Champlain. Folks take the ferry to work over to the big city there. They enjoy bike riding and hiking, just like we do. At their latest town meeting, whether to raise taxes on a network of recreation trails actually saw far more interest than presidential politics.\nSpeaker 4: But as Susan Ohanian of Charlotte remarked today, we do the little things and the big things because we are part of the United States, as well as being very concerned about what happens locally. Just like Richmond and Charlotte.\nSpeaker 4: We are not asking the city to initiate an impeachment investigation itself. We don't want the city council or staff to spend much time on this at all. Beyond approving the model resolution we delivered on February 21st. Passing a resolution is a courageous act, but it is not a difficult one.\nSpeaker 4: Cities, counties and states call upon Congress on various topics all the time. This action is in that tradition of our democracy, where American citizens not feeling heard find their voice in their local officials. You are our voice. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Alan Machan.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, Mayor. Council members. First, I want to thank you all for passing the sanctuary city resolution several weeks ago. As a first generation American whose parents immigrated from Egypt and Syria, my parents would certainly not have been allowed in this country under what is going on today.\nSpeaker 6: This resolution is very important because you, the council, are our voice for the citizens. We are deprived by the Constitution of being able to initiate an impeachment of the president or any member of Congress, which I think is a fatal flaw in our in our Constitution and our democracy.\nSpeaker 6: If one of you was guilty or had done something really inappropriate, inappropriate. The citizens of this city could take action and we could do something about it. We're counting on you to do something for us and to show the the federal government, to show the world that we Americans are not in agreement with what's going on.\nSpeaker 6: And I in 2003, a political scientist wrote in our article about the 14 characteristics of fascism. I'm going to leave this article for you here. I just would like to give give you a brief a brief summary of it, because it is so pertinent to what we are seeing happening today on a daily basis.\nSpeaker 6: And these and these characteristics were common to Hitler and Mussolini, Franco, Suharto and Pinochet. Powerful and continuing nationalism. Disdain for the recognition of human rights. I.D. of enemies. Scapegoats as a unifying cause. Supremacy of the military. Rampant sexism.\nSpeaker 6: Controlled mass media. Obsession with national security, religion and government are intertwined. Corporate power is protected. Labor power is suppressed. Disdain for intellectuals and the arts. Obsession with crime and punishment. Rampant cronyism and corruption. Fraudulent elections. These sound very, very, very familiar to what we're seeing in our country today.\nSpeaker 6: And every American should stand up and fight against what we're seeing and try to put our ship of state back on a correct course. Thank you. Please support the resolution.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Katherine Cameron. And then John OTA and then Leslie Walsh.\nSpeaker 4: And I want to assure you, Madam Mayor, and council people.\nSpeaker 1: That we have worked really hard, some of us to say very little tonight, knowing that.\nSpeaker 4: It's late.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Katie Cameron. I am a resident of Alameda. I'm here to support the resolution before you urging Congress to investigate and if merited, to impeach Donald Trump. This is not a conclusion. This is an.\nSpeaker 1: Investigation.\nSpeaker 4: Every citizen that I've.\nSpeaker 3: Talked with.\nSpeaker 1: On Alameda Island over the last month and a half, Republican and Democrat.\nSpeaker 4: Bernie supporter, you have it is.\nSpeaker 1: Supporting an investigation of Donald Trump. Some of them.\nSpeaker 3: Might.\nSpeaker 5: Think that it should.\nSpeaker 4: Start with independent investigations and other kinds of things, but they.\nSpeaker 3: Want him investigated. We are all concerned about Trump's possible collusion.\nSpeaker 1: With the Russians. And let's remember.\nSpeaker 3: That last fall we actually asked Donald Trump.\nSpeaker 0: We actually.\nSpeaker 1: Watched Donald Trump ask the.\nSpeaker 3: Russians to hack the DNC headquarters. So there's no mystery about his collusion as far as I'm concerned, and his tangled worldwide business interests.\nSpeaker 4: Which violate the.\nSpeaker 3: Constitution. Some say there are already congressional investigations going on, but many are faltering or being canceled or compromised. And let's face it, that's partly because there's enormous.\nSpeaker 1: Pressure when the president and the Congress are largely of the same party.\nSpeaker 3: Cities have not only the right but the responsibility to convey the sentiments of its residents to Congress and to help protect.\nSpeaker 4: Our precious.\nSpeaker 3: Democratic institutions. Passing this resolution will not cost the city a penny, nor take up much of your time. The constitutional remedy for presidential misconduct is impeachment.\nSpeaker 1: Later on, when we look back.\nSpeaker 3: I think we will say that passage of this resolution tonight, speaking loud and clear for our Constitution.\nSpeaker 4: Was one of this city's finest hours. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, John. And then Leslie Walsh.\nSpeaker 6: Madam Mayor. Madam Vice Mayor. And City Council members. I'm a I've been living in Alameda for 25 years, the first time I've come before this body. And that reflects how strongly I feel about this issue. I am here to do my duty to.\nSpeaker 6: Defend the Constitution and our democracy. And I am here to ask you, as our elected representatives, to do the same, to stand up for our Constitution and our democracy. I think that this president that we have now is.\nSpeaker 6: Certainly the first president ever in our history who has violated the Constitution from day one and violated it deliberately by violating the Emoluments Clause. You know, there was plenty of discussion. Before, before he took office about this, his possible conflicts of interest.\nSpeaker 6: And so he certainly knew what was going on and decided to proceed anyway with without divesting himself of his many business interests. Which receive a lot of money from from foreign governments. He's also, I think, the first president who, while he was running for president, actively advocated.\nSpeaker 6: A, you know, total ban on Muslims, which is in clear violation of the Constitution. Now you may ask, okay, well, what does this have to do with us here in Alameda? This is, you know, way out there in Washington.\nSpeaker 6: But to me, this is not an abstract issue. My family and my wife. My wife's family were among the more than 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were rounded up by the US government and put into prison camps in. Various places around this country.\nSpeaker 6: And that was all done as a result of an executive order by the president. An unconstitutional executive order, I might add. So. To me, this is this is not an abstract issue. This is a very real issue. We need to take action to defend the Constitution.\nSpeaker 6: The only you know, the Constitution, as we learned in World War Two, is only a piece of paper. It's only as strong as people are willing to stand up and fight for it. So today, I think that, you know, what we have at stake is our democracy and.\nSpeaker 6: Possibly, you know, our existence as as a people. I think, you know, we face the possibility of of a nuclear war and the dangers of climate change. So we need to do what we can to change the situation and stand up for democracy.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Leslie Walsh. And then that e and then can. Can Cameron.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members. My name is Leslie Walsh and I am a 20 year resident of Alameda. I'm here tonight to support the suggested resolution presented to the City Council on February 21st, calling upon Congress to bring impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump and to ask that the city of Alameda be on the right side\nSpeaker 1: of history and defending our institutions and our Constitution. I grant you that this is a bold request. Calling for bold action. But it is right action. And I want to tell you why I think it's right action. Because as the majority party Republican leaders in Congress are responsible for holding Donald Trump accountable to fully disclose his and\nSpeaker 1: his aides connections to the Russian government, as well as to fully disclose the Trump family's business interests that appear to be in direct violation of the Emoluments Clause of our Constitution. Mr. Trump has refused to do so, and the so called Republican led investigations can be dragged out for years, as has happened in the past.\nSpeaker 1: Donald Trump has only held office for less than two months and within the first month declared, in essence, that the press is the enemy of the American people. But does that. One pundit stated Trump may not understand the implication of this, but Steve Bannon certainly does.\nSpeaker 1: And I agree. Because it's a close cousin to Joseph Stalin statement that the press is an enemy of the state. That is a chilling statement. In many ways, I'm in disbelief that I'm standing here on a matter as grave as the one before you.\nSpeaker 1: But as a citizen and as a true believer in democracy and our system of government, I don't feel I have any other choice. I have to join my colleagues in this grassroots endeavor and ask you as our city leaders to join us as well.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm going to close with two things. Trump has just demonstrated that he's an undisciplined person, but his appointees aren't. So if this quote attributed to Hannah Arendt doesn't scare you, I don't know what will. And I quote, A disciplined minority of totalitarians can use the instruments of the democratic government to undermine democracy itself.\nSpeaker 1: And lastly, if any of you are using an iPhone. If Steve Jobs, father from Syria, had been denied access to our country, we wouldn't be using these little gizmos. So I leave you with that. Thank you for listening.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very. And then can't, can Cameron.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Madam Mayor. Madam Vice Mayor, council members and staff.\nSpeaker 4: I've been living in Alameda since 2007.\nSpeaker 3: And this is my first time speaking in the council. So why now? The reason is that I'm alarmed by the actions of the president of the United States. I'm here to support the resolution calling on Congress to investigate if there are grounds to impeach the president.\nSpeaker 3: Given what everyone has said, I think that there's already enough, you know, evidence to support such an investigation. If violations have occurred, then the president of the United States must be held accountable for these actions. I do not think this resolution is partizan.\nSpeaker 3: The president's actions have been alarming, and I think we need to respond in kind. We need to sound the alarm that his actions must be investigated. And I believe the time to act is now. Emerging you to pass this resolution tonight and take the stand for our community and sound the alarm.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Can Cameron. Then Steve Larsen and then Gaby Dorfman.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, council members and interested citizens.\nSpeaker 12: With regard to the impeachment resolution, I would like to associate myself.\nSpeaker 6: With the eloquent marks of Isabella and Mr. Odie. They've sort of stolen a lot of our thunder. I just did want to make one.\nSpeaker 12: Of my speaking points, which sort of.\nSpeaker 6: Ties this national issue and local issue back to. Those of us here in Alameda, the. City manager was mentioning monitoring the EPA.\nSpeaker 12: And the I would consider it a parade of horrors coming out of the EPA. We're particularly sensitive.\nSpeaker 6: Here to air and water.\nSpeaker 12: And having them be clean and appropriate. We have a great environment. We need the kind of balanced approach to public service and public policy and communitarian values. And those have been nearly destroyed. And we see that almost on a daily basis.\nSpeaker 6: I don't think there needs to be a lot more said about this. It's been said by our council.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Steve Thorson. And then Gabby Dolphin and then Philip James.\nSpeaker 6: Saving Mayor Spencer and the council and staff. I'm a long time aluminum. Third generation aluminum. I'm here to speak in opposition to this resolution. I can't believe you put such a stupid resolution on the agenda. This is just crass, partizan politics that we've been hearing during the election, after the election and what have you.\nSpeaker 6: It has nothing to do with running the city of Alameda. Now you say you want to. Make a resolution to petition. Someone. Well, you need my authorization to do that. And you need the authorization of every single voter, the city of Alameda, in order for you to say that you actually represent them and you don't have it\nSpeaker 6: . And I'm not giving you my authorization.\nSpeaker 12: City of Richmond.\nSpeaker 6: Has passed a similar resolution. So I'm going to suggest before you go off in the wild blue yonder. That you quash this resolution. And you monitor what happens to the city of Richmond. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Gabby Dolphin.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam Mayor. Madam Vice Mayor, city council members and staff. This is not about partizan politics. This is not about good or bad, right or.\nSpeaker 3: Wrong. This is about legal or illegal. So those of you here who have law degrees think I'm not saying.\nSpeaker 4: Think about that, but I.\nSpeaker 3: State that this is the key factor here. I everything I do, as you've seen me percolate on to the surface of Alameda has to do with leveling the playing.\nSpeaker 4: Field so that everybody.\nSpeaker 3: Can have an equal chance and equal shot at our democratic institutions and the vote. And so what I do in this case is to say who can possibly be in that ideal sense, above the law? Not one person, and.\nSpeaker 4: Certainly not according to our Constitution and according to the American understanding, not even our president. So, I mean, it does I don't care who you voted for. I really don't.\nSpeaker 3: I don't care if you attend the inauguration of our president. What I do care about is looking at the legality and where it goes from there. It will go from there. I want to say quickly before.\nSpeaker 4: I close, I really appreciate that update. Thank you, Frank, for the idea. I mean, following up on that and I might suggest you go to the Alameda Sun and under fire and police you list a possible thing out of your office, too, because we have something to really be concerned about here, folks.\nSpeaker 3: Folks. And it has to do with the symptoms of fascism.\nSpeaker 4: And they have reared their.\nSpeaker 3: Ugly head and we need as.\nSpeaker 4: A community to stand together. You are a reflection of the community. It's never 100% vote this way or that for any of you, any one motion. But on the whole.\nSpeaker 3: The.\nSpeaker 0: Momentum, the.\nSpeaker 4: When you have the majority.\nSpeaker 3: Of the community.\nSpeaker 4: Feeling this way, then I do believe it's incumbent upon you. And I thank you, all of you, for considering this and for bringing it to.\nSpeaker 3: The floor again. This is not good, bad, right? Wrong.\nSpeaker 4: This is is it legal or is it illegal? Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Phillip James and then Maureen to cost and then Kathy McIntyre.\nSpeaker 6: Kevin Garvey. I think I'm a little taller than you. Sorry. Here we go again. I will try to keep this brief. We had an earlier speaker who talked about whether or not this body needed the permission of every citizen to put forth this resolution.\nSpeaker 6: We are lucky to still live in a representative democracy. We have elected you to act on our behalf, and I think it's telling how many people who are speaking tonight and we'll probably speak after me have come forward saying this is the first time they've ever spoken at city council.\nSpeaker 6: That says something to me when I see this many people getting involved on an issue. Now there are some who think that we should try to respect Trump's office or who fall into the the ceremony and the celebration around having a new president.\nSpeaker 6: Those people who want to wait and see them. I say the time for appeasement is over and the time for wait and see is over. As patriots, our responsibility is not to respect the office for the sake of the office, but to hold accountable those who fill our elected positions at every level all the way to the\nSpeaker 6: top. This proposal is an opportunity for all of us to bring the truth to light, to loudly support our American values, and to be united at our meetings against someone who strains our civil liberties and who makes a mockery of our modern democracy.\nSpeaker 6: I urge all the members of this Council to be leaders in moving forward with the proposal. Your statement will not be made alone, but with the true patriots of Alameda behind you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Marine two costs. Maureen. Last call for Marine. All right, Kathy McIntyre. Kathy McIntyre. Last call for Kathy McIntyre. Charles hurt. Charles hurt? Yeah.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening.\nSpeaker 9: I think it'll be very easy.\nSpeaker 6: For me to enumerate very specific points that are absolute shortcomings in our.\nSpeaker 9: Current president. Fact, I don't even.\nSpeaker 6: Want to use the guy's name. I find him offensive as a lack of integrity. He's absolutely dishonest and there is no need to do any figuring or thinking about. All you have to do is read what you see in the newspapers.\nSpeaker 6: And you know.\nSpeaker 9: I'm going to take it that some of these.\nSpeaker 6: Newspapers are actually honorable. And you will be.\nSpeaker 9: Quite evidence that what we.\nSpeaker 6: Have is a very unethical person in power. Who's undermined every one of our fundamental institutions. Voting. You know, the respect.\nSpeaker 9: And rights of women's.\nSpeaker 6: Bodies. You know. Everything about this person.\nSpeaker 9: Is wrong. And I think.\nSpeaker 6: That there is an absolute imperative on your part to make a statement representing us. Indicating our displeasure with this person. There is there's no need to think or, you know, ponder or consider one way or another. Every bit of evidence necessary exists right now.\nSpeaker 6: And. I demand that you vote in favor of this recommendation. Because there is no better place to start than here. And we have to start here. I see a few people here, which I believe are sympathetic to what I'm talking about.\nSpeaker 6: And we've made our statement. Now it's your job. You need to take care of it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Helen. Source.\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate this excellent compilation of issues that Trump has flouted from before his inauguration and acted on since. And I really urge the passage of this request on our behalf to consider the nefarious acts he's committed as impeachment.\nSpeaker 1: Swift action is really essential. As daily, he tears down more of our beliefs and hard won principles. Is having such a destructive impact on local and global standards is frightening. And hopefully Almeida's courage in passing this resolution, as I hope you will, will encourage other communities to speak out and follow suit.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for your courage.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Maria Callas. And then Tony de Saag and then James Jackson. And if you want to pick on the side and please submit your slips.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. My name is Maria Callas. I'm a.\nSpeaker 11: Native.\nSpeaker 2: Californian and I'm a.\nSpeaker 4: Patriot.\nSpeaker 11: I'm a social worker practicing psychotherapy, working and living in Alameda County.\nSpeaker 4: I am proud to reside in a sanctuary sanctuary city. I am here to speak.\nSpeaker 11: In favor of a congressional investigation regarding the impeachment of President.\nSpeaker 4: Donald J. Trump. Is a threat to democracy and does not act in the best interest of the health and.\nSpeaker 11: Welfare of the citizens of the United States of America.\nSpeaker 4: His xenophobic, misogynistic and factitious rhetoric.\nSpeaker 11: Is traumatizing to our community.\nSpeaker 4: Inciting fear and validating hate crimes. I witness the direct impact of this in my work.\nSpeaker 11: In a state that thrives on immigration and diversity, we are.\nSpeaker 4: Especially financially vulnerable to his.\nSpeaker 1: Impulsive.\nSpeaker 11: Bigoted behavior.\nSpeaker 4: Holding him accountable to his actions.\nSpeaker 11: Will be healing to our community.\nSpeaker 4: As well as our.\nSpeaker 11: Global relations. As a patriot, I take.\nSpeaker 4: Pride in fostering a society.\nSpeaker 11: That welcomes and protects diversity, which is why I am in favor of this investigation. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Tony de Sorghum and Jean Jackson.\nSpeaker 1: Since you asked.\nSpeaker 9: It's good to be here tonight to talk on this weighty issue. And let me just frame it this way. Without a doubt. We live in interesting and alarming times, no doubt about that.\nSpeaker 6: Times in which our passions or what is right and best are rightfully stirred.\nSpeaker 9: And times in which not just the member of the public, but elected officials and city staff are called to rise and to see through our passions so that we can address what is wrong and make it right.\nSpeaker 6: What is bad and make it good.\nSpeaker 9: There is a lot about the Trump administration that certainly bewilders us.\nSpeaker 6: I know on a.\nSpeaker 9: Personal level, every time I walk out of my door living next door to a mosque in Alameda, I can see the pained expression that began before November, but began leading in the months up to November. So for that reason.\nSpeaker 9: When City Council responded to the ban on Muslims, City Council rightfully rightfully stood up to an action stemming from Washington, D.C.. And I think that's the way that I want council members to contemplate the issue before tonight. Because when you dealt with the Muslim ban issue, you said, how are these rules or policies affecting specifically Alameda and\nSpeaker 6: . How are they affecting our neighborhood safety? Are they affecting our streets, our parks?\nSpeaker 9: And I want you to frame issues accordingly. And I want you to ask yourselves, how will impeachment make our neighborhood safer? How will impeachment of Donald Trump improve our safety of our streets? How will impeachment improve the delivery of services in our parks and our libraries?\nSpeaker 9: I want you to not only respond to this.\nSpeaker 6: Passionate issue with your hearts.\nSpeaker 9: But also with your minds, with your.\nSpeaker 6: Councilmember hat.\nSpeaker 9: Representing the Alameda as best as you can. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Jane Jackson. And she's our last speaker on this item. If you'd like to speak on it, please submit your. And I really want to commend you all for not happy because we're getting through it almost 11 now.\nSpeaker 0: 17 speakers.\nSpeaker 1: Mm. Well, good evening, Madame Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: And that.\nSpeaker 4: Madame Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: And all.\nSpeaker 1: City council members now. I am a believer in Mr. Trump, and I came here to endorse his presidency and not his impeachment. I did not want to be a subject living in a province of Hillary Clinton's universe. By the grace of God.\nSpeaker 1: I am not so far. Accusations that Mr. Trump incited racism. This is a characteristic that represents our former administration with his divisiveness. Openly lying about public affairs. Hillary spun a tangled web of them about a video she claimed triggered Benghazi.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Trump's contact with Russian officials is more media propaganda than truth. Accepting gifts and fulfilling and profit profiting from foreign states. Hillary, the champion for women's rights, accepted thousands from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump is a man of his word.\nSpeaker 1: Already confirmed freedom of school choice. And that is a big important. Something I hold very dear. I think it's awful how children have to go to the school where they live, close to where some some children don't have a choice of getting a really decent education.\nSpeaker 1: Already. Restored businesses coming back to America and. Fortification of a diminished military and. We need a military now. I haven't heard anyone in here mention the threat of ISIS. And you can laugh, but it's it's there. The sniping attacks directed at Mr. Trump from malevolent losers of the election, fraudulent claims of sex abuse, thugs that are passed\nSpeaker 1: into riot at pro-Trump rallies. All are beneficiaries of George Soros, who fears going to the grave before he will be able to see America for. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. An 11:00 will need a motion to continue the meeting. It requires three votes. Do we have a motion moved? Second, all those in favor. I curious unanimously. Thank you. We have another speaker, Laura Fries. And if you want to speak on this item, please submit your set.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 2: For listening.\nSpeaker 1: To what I have to say. Council members and mayor and Vice Mayor. I am speaking for the first time at a meeting. I love government. I grew up with a history teacher who taught me civics duty and what it means to be responsible.\nSpeaker 1: I believe strongly in the principle that if I don't agree with what you say, I will defend with my life your right to say it. I love hearing from the two people who have disagreed with my wish for you to support this resolution, because I believe that we learn best from hearing from the opposition.\nSpeaker 1: I support this resolution because I believe that Trump is someone who has never been held accountable by his own party, by people that are currently backing him up and his cabinet. It's amazing for me just to see his influence that he's had on the local level.\nSpeaker 1: Carrying the agenda item before about housing was shocking to me that on that level it's trickling all the way down to our local level. That funding is now disappearing. That was something that was a huge revelation for me.\nSpeaker 1: So I just want to be brief and say that I am in support of this resolution.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Council members did. We want to start with Claire. Any questions? We do that first. Question. And my question was going to be, how much does our city pay for federal lobbyists?\nSpeaker 4: Um. I think it's.\nSpeaker 1: Less than $100,000. It's.\nSpeaker 0: $100,000 or.\nSpeaker 4: Something.\nSpeaker 1: Less than that.\nSpeaker 4: No, this. I don't have that off the top of my head, but it's close to it's over 50,000.\nSpeaker 0: It's over 50. Okay. Thank you. Another question I have is some of these emails have that we've received we've received many emails suggest that it is outside of the jurisdiction for our council to weigh in on this issue to support this.\nSpeaker 0: City attorney, I want to ask you if you think it's within our jurisdiction to support this.\nSpeaker 4: I believe that it really is a free speech issue.\nSpeaker 1: And that, as some of the speakers have said, and I think the two.\nSpeaker 4: Council members, the vice mayor and council member, already have indicated there is some connection to what the government, the federal state government does that has impact on local government. So it's my opinion that you certainly talk about you.\nSpeaker 0: You know, there are questions from council members. So Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 11: You know, some people have said, how is Alameda impacted by this? Everyone, including all comedians, are impacted, deeply impacted when there is allegations of tampering with our elections. We are all impacted by that. And we are directly impacted.\nSpeaker 11: If. If this occurred and we are directly impacted, if our president had a hand in it and nobody is above the Constitution, and certainly if we're requiring transparency around elections and boards for our local elected officials and our our volunteer community members who serve on different boards and commissions, that they have to disclose financial interests, that they\nSpeaker 11: have to refrain from and abstain from involving themselves in any decisions or actions that could directly impact their own financial interests. And when our Constitution expressly says that the President cannot benefit from public office, we are all directly impacted.\nSpeaker 11: We're also directly impacted when free press is silenced, which is what's happened there. They've been silenced for asking questions and inquiring when evidence has presented itself that something unlawful or unconstitutional has occurred. And certainly, I would say the highest level of questioning by our free press is specific to government action and specific to our Constitution.\nSpeaker 11: And so when there is evidence of of these alleged wrongdoings, we all have a direct impact in this. And everybody here does. And our system is impacted. And the faith in our system needs to be restored. And the only way we do that is by looking into what has presented itself to find out what has gone on\nSpeaker 11: . And I think, you know, in a federalist system, even little municipalities like Alameda have a stake in this and have a stake in making sure that our system, that everything has been looked into and investigated and questions surrounding voting and our elections and our press have been looked into to make sure that we restore faith in our\nSpeaker 11: system, because we're also a part of it. And this is this is one of those opportunities that if the lowest level of government can't represent the citizens of Alameda or any other community to the federal government to say, hey, please look into this, please make sure nothing bad has occurred.\nSpeaker 11: Let us know that you're doing something about it. If we can't do that, I don't know who can. And we are certainly stronger together and stronger when we're united and we're stronger when we take official action. And I think it's very important that we do this and that the buck stops here and that we start now and\nSpeaker 11: that we put the pressure on to look into this before anything worse happens. So I hope that my council, my fellow council members will join Councilman Brody and I in voting for this referral.\nSpeaker 0: It's all just.\nSpeaker 3: Too long ago.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So this is I think for me, it's another issue that's challenging to figure out, you know, pros and cons of it. And I. Completely here and support many of the concerns in regards to our current president. Regardless of the comments that we need to have a voice, our people need to have a voice on this issue\nSpeaker 0: . I would submit that we have a very strong voice for us that we have voted for consistently for the past, I believe, 18 years, something like that. And that is our representative, Barbara Lee. She and I've had I've spoken with her office several times recently on not just this issue, but also the sanctuary city issue.\nSpeaker 0: And at this point, there her position has been that she's not asking cities to weigh in on this. And that doesn't mean that we don't have that. We can't weigh in on it. But there's not the ask at this time.\nSpeaker 0: I think we also have very strong leadership in our House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has spoken at least twice on the issue back on February six, that there are grounds for displeasure and unease in the public about the performance of this president, who's acted in a way that's strategically incoherent.\nSpeaker 0: It is incompetent. It's reckless. But that is not grounds for impeachment. And then more recently, she's said that, and that's February 27th. That doesn't mean that nobody is listening to cases that are being made in a very scientific, methodical way as to whether there are grounds for impeachment.\nSpeaker 0: Again, I think we have very strong leadership on this issue. And when you look at the Constitution, the Constitution does, in fact, provide that it is the House of Representatives who has the sole power of impeaching. And then it is the Senate that tries the impeachment.\nSpeaker 0: My concern. And the the concern when it came to us in regards to the sanctuary city. At that time. We did have a phone call with some of our police staff. And the reason I brought up the lobbyists also, and I'll get to that.\nSpeaker 0: But in regards of our release staff at that time and more recently has been the risk to the city of financially. Because we we have a base out our name, our former naval base that is in the process of being cleaned up, but it's not cleaned up yet.\nSpeaker 0: So there's work to be done there. We are also trying we have a VA clinic we would like to have out at the base. That is important to our plan of how we're going to move forward with the base.\nSpeaker 0: We have married ships that lease. We have our Coast Guard island. We have I've received emails from families that are concerned with special needs, children, housing and other moneys. And in fact, the issue of financial the changing financial environment when it comes to our city.\nSpeaker 0: Then the question is, all right, so we did it on the sanctuary city. And I think that that was important because. That is, in fact, we are a city and we are the ones that determine whether or not we would then be a sanctuary city and do our best to meet the needs and and try to address\nSpeaker 0: the fears and concerns of our citizens. This is then to support this would then be a. It's a second time that we would be sending a very strong message to our president and then. Will it make? Now, I know many speakers this evening.\nSpeaker 0: It's very important that you all think it will make a big difference in regards to our representation. And I with all due respect, I, I strongly believe that Barbara Lee and Nancy Pelosi are are doing their job as well as can be done.\nSpeaker 0: I think that the concern truly is the red states. And at the end of the day, that to me is where this issue, if there's going to be a change in support, that it would be more so from those states.\nSpeaker 0: And the risk to our city. We are not we have a limited budget. We spent, I don't know, maybe an hour tonight on the discussion of $6 billion. The moneys we receive from the federal government significantly more than that and it's the larger part of our budget.\nSpeaker 0: So ah, if we're were so I will not be supporting this. I think it's critical that we support our athletes at this time. I'm going to say I will not be supporting it at this time. I will be following the leadership of our representatives of Barbara Lee and Nancy Pelosi and their leadership and supporting their efforts.\nSpeaker 0: And I will also be doing my utmost to support our council, as well as our federal lobbyists, to do our best to protect our finances as limited as they are. Band member matter?\nSpeaker 6: SC Yeah, so I think on the sanctuary city issue, that was a clear to me a very clear protective step that we took. And I think the the question of the risk to funding versus the protection of constitutional rights of our residents, it didn't matter.\nSpeaker 6: We had to protect that. On this one, I. I struggled with it. You know, I'm I'm in agreement that there is sufficient probable cause to fully investigate, particularly two items. The. Financial ties of the Trump Corporation to the president.\nSpeaker 6: And the effect of that and the ties to Russia, I think, have been in the news and have been well explained. And I don't like the characterization of federal government trickling down to Alameda because it's a torrent. When it hit here with regard to those two housing projects that we're trying to get off the ground for for\nSpeaker 6: the greatest need in the city. If I thought this was going to do something, I'd jump on it right now. I think it will do something in the future. There'll be a time for it. I think we can do everything we can as individual politicians because I think as it's rolling out, whether we like it or not\nSpeaker 6: , it is a partizan issue. And I think a resolution that we're acting as the city of Alameda at this time is is not really appropriate. I think as individual members of. Five politicians, we can make our voices be heard to the same effect as if we had a resolution.\nSpeaker 6: And I'd. I'd like to hold this off until. We have, I think, a clearer picture of what's happening in Congress. And I think we also don't need to put any more because people say, well, this won't cost us anything.\nSpeaker 6: We have one, two, three, four, five. We have city employees here who could be doing something else to do the very, very protections that we're trying to do to for our residents here in defending their constitutional rights. And.\nSpeaker 6: I'd just like some time.\nSpeaker 0: Remember Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mary Spencer. And thank you to all the speakers and my council colleagues, the vice mayor and council member, only for your eloquent remarks. I concur with just about all of you except that last speaker, but that's okay.\nSpeaker 7: Dissent is good with the president and what he's done. And. But at the same time, one of the things that appalls me about this president is his utter disregard for the rule of law, for the institutions that govern this this country, the the separation of powers of the executive branch, the judicial and the legislative.\nSpeaker 7: And so as the majority of us on the council, Laura, I'm a lawyer, I went back and dug out my trusty pocket volume of the Constitution, and the mayor quoted it. And she's right in the article, one of the Constitution, paragraph five, the House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment, and then the Senate shall\nSpeaker 7: have the sole power to try all impeachments. And when the President of the United States is tried, the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall preside, and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.\nSpeaker 7: So while I am as frustrated as many of you at the appalling turn of events in not even two months since this new President took office, I also am aware that. A symbolic resolution, as well-intended as it is.\nSpeaker 7: Is not going to have the impact that we need it to have. What is really needed and you've seen this in these votes to confirm the various cabinet appointees. Is more Democrats or at least more elected representatives with backbones to say, no, I won't go along with that.\nSpeaker 7: In this very state, we have some vulnerable Republican seats. I would urge people to act where they really can make a difference. Back in 2008, I traveled to three different states to support the presidency of Barack Obama because I thought and continued to think it was very important.\nSpeaker 7: And working locally, we can address the impacts of the administration's startling actions. And we've we've taken and taken actions. And and I credit Councilmember Jim Odey, who jumped on it right away. Some of us thought, oh, you're maybe being a little alarmist, but he wasn't at all in bringing the sanctuary city resolution.\nSpeaker 7: And we passed it. And we are making sure that the protections there are in place for our local citizens. And we also just a couple of weeks ago, this council met on a Friday, and we spent six or 7 hours discussing what our priorities would be, how we can be an effective council, what the important issues were\nSpeaker 7: that we need to address for this city, that the federal government's not going to come in and help us with, and we're struggling to get help from the state. And we came up with a matrix. And at the top of that were the housing issues, affordability, addressing homelessness, preventing homelessness, then traffic and transportation to move our residents\nSpeaker 7: around and get people on and off the island for jobs. And these these issues need attending. And we also discussed and concluded in this workshop that time is a finite commodity, both the time of the council that we have to deliberate and speak with you and ourselves and make decisions and also the time of our staff.\nSpeaker 7: And so if we if it were just as simple as saying, yeah, I sign on to this resolution, let's do it. That might be one thing, but it's not the city attorney. We cannot say so this all passes muster, right?\nSpeaker 7: We're going to need that analysis by city staff. And still at the end of the day, and I do agree with the mayor, I'll say we don't often agree on issues, but I do agree that we are blessed in this congressional district to have stellar representation in Barbara Lee.\nSpeaker 7: You know, I'm sure that she stood alone in opposition to the Iraq war when it was first declared in. And she was a leader and she continues to be a leader. We have a strong Bay Area congressional delegation, not the same in other parts of the state.\nSpeaker 7: But so what my concerns are is that. The staff. Time to carry out this. Very important, but largely symbolic at this point. Gesture will take time away from other pressing business that the Council and the city need to address.\nSpeaker 7: I. I can't support it, but I'm not voting no. I will abstain because again, I would love to see some changes made, some pressure kept on vulnerable districts. I don't think that we need to lean on Barbara Lee.\nSpeaker 7: And but when when when Congresswoman Lee, Nancy Pelosi, feel that it's time for the cities to get together and and be heard. We can certainly revisit this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So I remember one.\nSpeaker 9: Last chance to change hearts and minds.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, of course.\nSpeaker 9: So I appreciate everyone coming out and staying late, and I appreciate the vice mayor for bringing this forward with me. We're doing this together. I just wanted to maybe point out a few things that may change people's minds and may kind of correct some facts.\nSpeaker 9: I mean, I could sit I can go on and on all night about the political complaints I have. But this is not really a political issue. It's do we ask our representatives and not our sole representative, but representatives in Congress as a whole to conduct an investigation where there are at least publicly enough a prima facie case\nSpeaker 9: that there's been some violations of law. And, I mean, I don't think that that's going to stir the pot or cause us any undue harm. I mean, I was not put up here and elected to be a potted plant.\nSpeaker 9: So I'm not going to be a potted plant. I'm going to speak up. And when we feel that our democracy is at stake and our Constitution is violated, when we did the sanctuary city, we were all reminded that we took an oath to support the Constitution.\nSpeaker 9: And part of that constitution is our basically our country as a whole. So I looked I recall back, I think it was 23, 24. Section eight of Article one of the Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war.\nSpeaker 9: Yet in two that I can't remember was oh three or four. I stood on the opposite side of the dais like Rosemary Jordan did, and I participated with there was five or six of us because we read all of the names of all of the cities that passed a resolution saying to the Congress.\nSpeaker 9: We do not want to go to war in Iraq. Now that list again took four or five of us to go through with our 3 minutes each. And I was happy to hear that it's not just Richmond or wouldn't be just Alameda, but there are other cities, Nashville, in the heart of a red state that sends Republicans\nSpeaker 9: to Congress and Republicans to the United States Senate and votes for Republicans. So there are Republicans out there, and I don't have any problem with any Republicans. There are Republicans out there that actually do believe in the rule of law and do believe that our president should uphold the law.\nSpeaker 9: So I am not so convinced by the argument that just because the impeachment power is vested in Congress, because we're not asking to impeach, we're asking to investigate. If Congress decides there's enough evidence there, they will do what they they need to do.\nSpeaker 9: Just like with the Iraq war, we are not asking Congress. We're not impeding their ability to declare war. We were, as citizens, asking our Congress to not do it, to not go to war in Iraq. And, you know, turns out we were pretty much right that we shouldn't have done that.\nSpeaker 9: And I don't I don't see the difference between this and what we did last meeting, where we approved a legislative agenda. We basically said to our lobbyist, these are the things we want you to advocate for with the federal government or what we just did or 5 hours ago.\nSpeaker 9: Or there was an issue of great import to the folks of Alameda airplane noise where we sent a letter to the FAA. The FAA is responsible for regulating airplanes, not Alameda. It's not our job. It's not our responsibility.\nSpeaker 9: We have really no jurisdiction over that. But we decided we were going to send a letter because we have a problem with the way the federal government is doing it. Just to correct a couple of things we did have Pete Stark is a rep from 22 to 2012.\nSpeaker 9: So Barbara Lee, who I love greatly, has not been our rep for 18 years. And just to calm some of the fears. My understanding is that the closure of the naval base was part of the Base Closure Act that the federal government have responsibilities to do.\nSpeaker 9: And the cleanup is part of a federal law that the federal government has responsibilities to do. So the president cannot suddenly say, we are not going to clean up your base anymore. So I just want make sure that's clear.\nSpeaker 9: Coast Guard Island is a military base. It's authorized by the federal government. If Congress, if it's going to close, the Congress has to close it. The president has to approve it. It's not going to go anywhere because we say we want an investigation.\nSpeaker 9: The married lease is exactly what it says. It's a lease. It's a contract between two parties. If one of them breaches it, the other one can sue and recover damages. So married could terminate the lease. But the president can't terminate the lease.\nSpeaker 9: And if Merrit does, then we're going to sue them and collect damages for breach of lease. So I just want to make sure that it's clear that we're not fear mongering, that if we do take a stand and we do listen to you and we do stand up for the values which we believe in, that all of\nSpeaker 9: this stuff is suddenly going to disappear because it's not. So I'm sorry that we're not going to get support for this, but, you know, we live to fight another day. And maybe I changed my mind. Maybe I didn't.\nSpeaker 9: But thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 11: I'll go ahead and make a motion. To vote to. Consider the adoption of a resolution in support of a congressional investigation.\nSpeaker 9: A second.\nSpeaker 7: Discussion.\nSpeaker 0: I would like to discuss. Go ahead. Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 7: So to the authors of this measure, would you consider. A simplified resolution directed to our congressional representative asking that she. Support an investigation into impeachable offenses at such time as she felt it appropriate to bring it.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, I would.\nSpeaker 9: I mean, I would support that. I think it should maybe go to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House. Because we're really. And when? When I will say, when we do this in the state legislature, you know, we send these resolutions whether or not you consider them symbolic or not.\nSpeaker 9: But they're they're expressing the values of our state through our state legislature. You know, they're addressed to the Congress as a whole and not to an individual person. But, you know, I'm happy to.\nSpeaker 7: In the chair if.\nSpeaker 9: I could do both.\nSpeaker 7: So so I'm sorry. When you said the president of the Senate, you were referring to.\nSpeaker 9: The I think.\nSpeaker 7: You talked about.\nSpeaker 9: The tution. I think that's the vice president at this.\nSpeaker 7: Well, I mean, I believe the congressional I mean, the assembly member you're working with also working for also has a so I mean, we've all on this dais spent a little or a lot of time doing our fair share of lobbying one way or another.\nSpeaker 7: One of the things that happens, and I know your daughter worked in a congressional office in D.C., did start mine, Mike Honda, when they were in college. So when someone calls into a congressional office, the first question that's asked is, may I have your address?\nSpeaker 7: And I'm here to tell you that even if I call, you know what's real common now in the South Bay, that doesn't hold a whole lot of water. So that's why I'm I'm looking for something that I think really would be effective.\nSpeaker 7: But but Utah, I'm not trying to wordsmith your a measure, but I'm trying to see if there's something that can be solved.\nSpeaker 9: If I can just if we addressed it to the speaker and the president of the Senate, our two senators and our representative, I would be fine with that.\nSpeaker 7: And then but the second part is I I'm concerned about the the form resolution because I do think that that takes I mean, there were a number of different allegations. And I think that that needs to go through our city attorney's office for some analysis.\nSpeaker 7: Is there a way that we could make a more general request?\nSpeaker 9: I'd be fine with that, because the point is not to say that we think bad things has happened, but that we think there should be an investigation to determine whether bad things have happened. I think Richmond, you know, had a pretty simplified, shortened version.\nSpeaker 9: And so that.\nSpeaker 7: I. I wonder if, Madame Mayor, would you consider maybe a 5 to 7 minute break, if maybe do you do the drafters want to have a little time or do you want to just do it as you go?\nSpeaker 0: So I will.\nSpeaker 11: I would support I would support a break. I do think. Sending it to. Our representative or congressional representative, Barbara Lee is something I'd be supportive of in the alternative of not passing anything. And I think that, you know, specifically at her town hall.\nSpeaker 11: She did say that and I quote, We're in discussions. There are lawyers looking into this building. The case, they haven't gotten there yet. I think you'll find members of Congress are going toward where the facts lead. This issue of impeachment is on the radar of almost every member that I know.\nSpeaker 11: But we haven't got to the point where we can actually file articles. That was a couple weeks ago. Things have changed. My understanding is that there's now even more things that they're looking into. I would like to empower her by giving her something that she can bring forward when the time comes to say that she does have\nSpeaker 11: support within her district to move forward. So in lieu of passing, you know, what we have, I would certainly be open to an amended version.\nSpeaker 0: I wanted to get back to Nebraska. So if I heard correctly, your request or your suggestion was that we would support it would. Alert. Let our really know that we support her efforts, but with time that she determines appropriate and we would be just supporting her.\nSpeaker 7: Again, I would I would let the drafters modify their language. And actually, I would also consider the individuals that Councilmember Odie mentioned. I think it's not inappropriate to also submit to the president of the Senate, the.\nSpeaker 9: Harris and Senator Feinstein.\nSpeaker 7: Oh, obviously. Ah, yes. But the other thing I'm trying to do is so if we could get rid of the long list, because as you said, it's probably growing every day. But I'm trying to also economize our staff time and get to the heart of what you're trying to do.\nSpeaker 6: M.I.A.\nSpeaker 0: Never met her.\nSpeaker 6: I think what it comes down to, if I've heard this correctly, is that. Our congresswoman is is working with a group of. Or delegate the of our delegation to build the case that they can they can present to Congress.\nSpeaker 6: I think on behalf of the people of Alameda, that's a fair thing to to support is that if they're preparing the case. Because we're seeing lots of reports. We don't have any facts in front of us. We do have facts that are reported in the paper.\nSpeaker 6: I'm not a I'm the only one up here is not aware of someone. So I do not know. And I think most of the people in Alameda were. The impression is we were calling for impeachment. And I think the to put a point on it having communication an official letter from the city council to Barbara Lee saying\nSpeaker 6: that we back your activities and invest in investigating and building a case that can be presented, I think is the step that's appropriate at this point. Once that activity is finished and there's a case, then I think we move to the next level.\nSpeaker 4: So if we could perhaps take a quick recess.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So we're going to take a five or ten minute recess.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Have a ten minute recess out of the room.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Within the notice of what we're doing.\nSpeaker 0: Everyone could please.\nSpeaker 1: Take their.\nSpeaker 0: Seats. We're going to resume. Thank you very much. Appreciate your cooperation. It's now 10 minutes to midnight. All right. Vice Mayor, did you want to.\nSpeaker 11: So we've if we could have LA read the proposed resolution and then what we would do is we would actually have staff. We would part. The other part would be directing staff to write a brief cover letter to the of the elected representatives in question.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: It's City of Alameda Resolution in support of Congressional Investigation of President Donald J. Trump. Whereas various reports have alleged that President Trump may be in violation of the warrant or now emoluments. Thank you. Monuments Clause and the Domestic Emoluments Clause of the United US Constitution.\nSpeaker 2: And. Whereas, information has become public alleging that President Trump and his associates may have colluded with foreign authorities to coordinate illegal efforts to influence the outcome of the election and to undermine U.S. government policy regarding sanctions associated with alleged foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nSpeaker 2: And. Whereas, these alleged conflicts of interest and activities could be in violation of the Constitution and US law. Now, therefore, the City of Alameda resolves to support calls to the United States House of Representatives to investigate whether such violations occurred and are sufficient grounds for the impeachment of Donald J.\nSpeaker 2: Trump, President of the United States.\nSpeaker 0: Okay so remember ask.\nSpeaker 7: So question so this is directed to.\nSpeaker 11: This would be attached to a cover letter and sent specifically to Congresswoman Barbara Lee and then.\nSpeaker 9: I think the Richmond one went to the House Judiciary Committee chair. And did it go to the speaker? I can't remember. But. You know, I'm not sure it has to go to the Senate since. They're not going to.\nSpeaker 9: It's okay. But it it could be with our representatives. I think it should be all of them. I mean.\nSpeaker 7: All of our.\nSpeaker 9: Our representatives.\nSpeaker 7: Like our California senators. I mean, and to question to the city attorney, does that require any further research on the part of your department?\nSpeaker 4: No. What it what this was designed to do is just say there were alleged reports of potential wrongdoing, which the er at the City Council is asking that the house which is the appropriate body, to determine if there should be an investigation, should, should look into.\nSpeaker 0: So. Yeah, go ahead.\nSpeaker 6: My comment is I would have preferred a more direct line to our congressional representatives, Barbara Lee, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein saying that we support you or building the case based on. What was said there. Based on what we've basically based on what's been reported.\nSpeaker 6: In the areas of. Contact with foreign governments and with conflicts of interest.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I think those allegations are in what that what she could read it again lark and read it again the issue.\nSpeaker 6: And I agree that there are.\nSpeaker 2: Mean I can put it on the computer and put it up. We just Marilyn just made me think, actually, it would.\nSpeaker 7: Be nice.\nSpeaker 2: But it's our concern. I'll put it up in 2 seconds.\nSpeaker 6: But it to me, it wasn't direct. What I would support is that we're we're telling Barbara Lee and our congressional representatives that we think there's sufficient reports. And we support their investigation of these to see if there's a case to bring to the Congress for impeachment.\nSpeaker 4: So my recommendation and it's certainly whatever whatever counsel wants to do is that since we have had no ability, at least my office has no ability to know what the truth is of any of the reports that are out there.\nSpeaker 4: I understand there are reports in the press, but we don't have any ability to investigate those to know or verify the truth of any of those. So what we rather said was that there are reports out there, reports out there, which we can't independently verify, and it's not our job to independently verify, but that because of those\nSpeaker 4: allegations that are there, we are asking or supporting that the House Judiciary look into it.\nSpeaker 6: And so I actually agree because I don't think we should be spending staff time on this. I do think as as politicians we should be, and I do want it to be very direct and directly supporting. I think what is written here as far as calling these allegations is just fine.\nSpeaker 6: And it gives our congresswoman the support she needs to actually do the job that. She's charged with doing.\nSpeaker 9: I am so ahead. So what if we added? Now. Therefore, the City of Ireland resolved to support calls. Bye. That's Congresswoman Barbara Lee and others.\nSpeaker 6: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 0: Well, so that's what I thought we were thinking about doing. Was that there? Barbara Lee and our two congressional sources.\nSpeaker 7: The thing is.\nSpeaker 4: Again.\nSpeaker 7: With regard to the wording. Let's remember our constitutional guidelines here. The Senate will hear removal, but they do not. The sole responsibility for impeachment is in the Congress. If we want to send courtesy copies to U.S. Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, I should reverse that order for seniority.\nSpeaker 7: That's one thing. I don't think that they should be identified in the in the resolution, because we're not we wouldn't be there's nothing we can call upon them to do at this point in time.\nSpeaker 0: So what about support Congresswoman Barbara.\nSpeaker 4: Lee's.\nSpeaker 0: Efforts to call for an investigation? Well, surprise. Well, I would have. So personally, that's who I would say that we need to speak to our representative to support her efforts.\nSpeaker 4: I understand that. I just didn't know that she had called or if she if she has to support an investigation.\nSpeaker 7: That didn't seem to be what the vice mayor said.\nSpeaker 11: I would just say that I think that.\nSpeaker 6: You know.\nSpeaker 11: Leaving it as is and sort of in terms of just saying Congresswoman Barbara Lee and others because she's working with a coalition of other people. And I would like her to be able to take this resolution with her when she goes to meet with them to say, I have the support, maybe you should go out and get\nSpeaker 11: the support. And when we all have the support and we've taken our time and we've built our case, then we bring this forward and we do it with the blessing of our constituents.\nSpeaker 7: I like this wording and I can support it.\nSpeaker 9: And then we just cc the others and the letter. Yeah.\nSpeaker 7: Courtesy copies to our our senators. So do whatever you want to make. I mean, I don't mean to cut off discussion, but.\nSpeaker 4: It is so I'm sorry. I'm confused about who it's going to though. So far. Really.\nSpeaker 7: Right. It is. This resolution is directed to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, but we would send courtesy copies to our two U.S. senators representing California, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, because just as a courtesy, to know what some rabble rousers in one of their cities are doing.\nSpeaker 4: And not to the House Judiciary.\nSpeaker 1: Chairman or the speaker, I think.\nSpeaker 7: We can leave that to our congresswoman. That can include the others that we are. I think that's fine. I want to commend you.\nSpeaker 4: Got it.\nSpeaker 7: Keep it simple. I think it packs a punch.\nSpeaker 0: I think it respects that we have a very confident congresswoman, assembly member Barbara Lee, who I think is doing her job. So I mean.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. I mean, I'm good with this with. What my colleagues have suggested.\nSpeaker 4: That you want to make a motion.\nSpeaker 9: I'd like to move that. We move forward this referral based on the language that is up on the screen. I'll second in the minutes.\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. We're adopting a resolution, and I second the motion to adopt.\nSpeaker 0: All those in favor. I my motion carries unanimously. Thank you. And our next. And we will now be going, oh, no, actually, we now have council communications. Any Council communications.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Thank you, sir. And with that, we have the both of the hearings on the agenda. So let me let me start by going into our first hearing, which is the budget hearing, and then we'll do the second hearing, which is on a entertainment permit.\nSpeaker 0: So let's let's go ahead and begin with the budget hearing. Madam Clerk, if you want to read that and I know there's a full agenda, I also just want to remind the public that today is the first of.\nSpeaker 0: A handful of budget hearings that will happen in this chamber and some in the community. And so it does push meetings back. This is a time of the year where we spend a good amount of time talking about the budget.\nSpeaker 0: And so I do want to just make sure folks know that as we go into these next few weeks.\nSpeaker 1: Item 22 Report from Financial Management Recommendation to conduct a budget hearing to receive and discuss an overview of the proposed fiscal year 2022 budget city wide.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. There is a of an item in front of you on I think there's a presentation. I'm going to start the presentation and go through a few slides as as we all know, every year the budget is and the way it's proposed to the Council is a partnership that we undergo and that I undergo with the\nSpeaker 0: city manager. But it's really the department directors and Mr. and Mr. Modica that put together the budget every single year and then it's presented to the City Council. I think most folks received the budget and the public I think last week I believe was Friday and then today is the first kind of public review of that document\nSpeaker 0: . So what we have in front of us is a budget proposal that's focused around building back and recovering from this pandemic. The city's total proposed budget for FY22 is 3 billion. That reflects the city's recovery from the largest public health crisis of our lifetime.\nSpeaker 0: And I think the most important piece of this budget is that the budget includes no cuts, has no deficit, and replenishes, most importantly, the reserves that were lost during the pandemic. And I mentioned to the council before there's probably nothing more important than being prepared for that next emergency.\nSpeaker 0: And so having a replenish reserves is is, I think, a critical piece of this budget presentation. The F-22 budget takes into account the city's racial equity and reconciliation plan. And Mr. Mourdock will speak to that. And he will also speak to measure us, which of course, was approved by 57% of voters and how that integrates into the\nSpeaker 0: budget presentation. Also the budget, I think, makes a very, very strong makes a very strong statement as far as what we're focused on as it relates to our recovery. The Limited Recovery Act, which was the first Municipal Recovery Act presented actually across the country, is is a part of this budget.\nSpeaker 0: It's about almost $250 million of federal and state funds, most of it federal, as we know. And the city council has approved that Budget Recovery Act, as we know it allocates about 64 million for economic recovery, about 108 million to healthy and safe communities, and about 76 million to the city's reserves.\nSpeaker 0: Eliminating the furloughs and the elimination of the deficit, which is all part of securing our city's future. If you look at the economic recovery piece, you'll find in the budget there's a variety of of resources for residents and businesses, everything from protection for nonprofits and businesses on on COVID to support direct business support.\nSpeaker 0: At 20 million, there's airport support for 15 million. There's economic inclusion resources, the Clean Language Initiative, and so many others that are involved. These are just a sample of some of the economic recovery funds. In addition, under Health and Safe Community, there's also a variety of different investments investments around basic needs, around ensuring that people have child\nSpeaker 0: support and child care in our community. There's additional support for public health and COVID response, bounce prevention and Safe Cities money. There is about $10 million for homelessness and we also added to certain funds. So while example, the justice fund and language access were already in the budget, the American Recovery Act and through us, the long a\nSpeaker 0: recovery plan really added to those as well. And you see housing support at 56 million, which is really significant around tenant assistance. And then, of course, we spent a good amount of resources eliminating our shortfalls, replenishing reserves and ending furloughs, which was important for us as a city.\nSpeaker 0: I want to just to highlight a few community investments that our folks were engaged on and I had discussions about and that some councilmembers discussed with me as well. Those are all in there as part of the Long Beach Recovery Act and the budget that Mr. Modica will we'll explore.\nSpeaker 0: There's a variety of resources. I do want to point out the digital inclusion money which is in there. That's been a great new initiative of the City Council and other priorities. I'll note that certain priorities, like the Justice Fund, is receiving its strongest support this year, which I think is a really great move for us as a\nSpeaker 0: community. And there's other investments as relates to health of the community across the budget. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Monica, who will do the majority of the presentation. And we did this presentation, of course, last Friday to the community and to the media.\nSpeaker 0: And I think many of the councilmembers also, I think, watched it online. So Mr. Monica.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. If we can bring up the city manager's presentation. We're in the clear. The Mayor gave a very good summary of the budget and I will launch with this part. So the F 22 budget is 3 billion, as the mayor mentioned.\nSpeaker 7: It's 37 different fund groups, 126 funds and 23 departments. The main message, really, and the thing to keep in mind is that we are basically per continuing the previous year's budget. Yes, the budget has changes and all of our different funds, but as a whole, especially in the general fund, we were able to do something pretty significant\nSpeaker 7: which is not engage in reductions and not have some of these really difficult financial impacts. This year we were able to basically continue it from last year and the emphasis for the budget is really on pandemic recovery. I think it's been very clear that we're facing unprecedented challenges over the past 12 months, up to 16 months.\nSpeaker 7: It has been unprecedented both operationally and financially. We've really been focused on minimizing impacts of the pandemic, on our business community, on our residents, on people who had a very, very difficult times last year. We have strained our city resources and we've had to divert our staff capacity to the most urgent priorities.\nSpeaker 7: And that also means our financial resources. We've had a year of First Amendment demonstrations of civil unrest and systemic racial inequality in our society that we are addressing. So there's many accomplishments. We could be here a long time if we really went through them all.\nSpeaker 7: I'll just summarize just a couple. We really focused on safety and health during the pandemic and recovery. We implemented things like a relief payment plan, interest free and penalty free payment options for businesses, including parking citations as well.\nSpeaker 7: We launched for the first time ever, a $51 million rental assistance program where we're helping to pay rent, supporting both renters and landlords. We launched business programs under language based care, helping them on free one on one in-person support.\nSpeaker 7: We suspended late charges for utility customers, suspended shut offs of utilities to assist our customers. We did the Open Streets Initiative. We had 120 parklets in Long Beach restaurants and another 250 occasional event permits where businesses can use their parking lots or other structures in nontraditional use.\nSpeaker 7: We expanded services for people experiencing homelessness through Project Roomkey. Project Homekey. We built our very first Atlantic Bridge housing community, a 125 room, our first year round shelter at the airport. One of our tenants completed construction of the largest solar energy project in the airport's history.\nSpeaker 7: We got the airport health accreditation for commitment to passenger safety. We transitioned our library programs to online and went to contactless pickup. We had free printing services, and we distributed Chromebooks and modified devices. We developed a Youth Trust Strategic Plan to elevate youth and child development.\nSpeaker 7: At the same time, we focused on core services repairing over 25,000 potholes, trimming trees, removing tree stumps and replacing signs. And then we were also still recognized as a top ten digital city for the 10th year in a row.\nSpeaker 7: I want to remind you, too, that during the year we did some very significant investments in both our residents and our community through the CARES Act. We got $40 million and six months to spend it and really put it to good use.\nSpeaker 7: And we're able to show that we created a plan very quickly as a mayor and council staff implemented, that we passed every single audit of the funds and did a lot of good. I won't go through all of these, but you have them here on the slide.\nSpeaker 7: Everything from digital inclusion to black health equity to children and families and diapers and supporting communities most in need, access to food in individuals experiencing homelessness with shelter, and just a number of really amazing things. And so this council did approve the Recovery Act.\nSpeaker 7: We do believe we're the first big city that did that. It was a came together very quickly as an initial plan in focusing on economic recovery, health and safe community and securing our city's future. I won't go through all the the buckets because the mayor did that very well.\nSpeaker 7: I will say that it has temporary or temporarily solved the $30 million short fund in the general fund shortfall in the general fund. And just to give a sense of that, if we hadn't had those dollars, we'd be talking right now about some pretty significant reductions in the area of 145 different positions throughout our organization, because people\nSpeaker 7: are what we prefer who provide the services to our communities, and we would have to be having those discussions. And, you know, we are still going to have to have some budget balancing discussions and options and look at that for the next year and that there will be some service reductions.\nSpeaker 7: But we have a year to plan and we really still are looking at some of the strategic investments as well, so that we have to look to the future over this next year to figure out how we're going to address some of those future challenges.\nSpeaker 7: And so the funding for the Recovery Act comes from federal, state and county grants. It is actually up now. So we increased it was originally a $235 million plan that the council acted on in March. It's up it's 249 million since approved by the council.\nSpeaker 7: We've added a number of different areas, but at the same time, the biggest bucket of money, which is the money that we have the most discretion on from the federal government, actually went down. It went down about $17.9 million when we got our final allocation.\nSpeaker 7: So we did have to make some adjustments. We went through a methodology to essentially protect all of the programs that the council approved, but programs under 300,000, those were real small. We did not take any reductions in those.\nSpeaker 7: We because any percent reduction there would be pretty impactful from 300000 to 2 million, we reduced those by 10% and programs over 2 million. We reduced by 20% so that we didn't take it all out of the programing.\nSpeaker 7: We were able to identify about $6.5 million in the reserves category that due to financial projections, maybe did a little bit better. And we didn't need that $6.5 million as urgently. And the Recovery Act, just as you know, is 249 million is larger than some of the entire budgets of some of our other cities.\nSpeaker 7: And so that does require a lot of management, a lot of staffing to make sure that we're doing it appropriately and spending it effectively. We are proposing a three year staffing and administration plan to be able to incorporate into each one of those funds.\nSpeaker 7: And we also have some reporting requirements to the federal government and sort of minimize audit issues to keep the dollars as flexible as possible. We're using what's called the indirect funding option for ARPA. And so we're essentially attributing ARPA to revenue loss, which allows us to invest these dollars.\nSpeaker 7: But then we're also creating a very strict plan to be able to show that all of these programs line up with the original intent of the federal government. The framework for reconciliation is a big part of our budget.\nSpeaker 7: On August 11, 2020, we adopted that plan. There's been a number of actions that have occurred, and we're going to be coming back in August with a larger report on the one year anniversary of that work. The Office of Equity has moved to the city manager's office and has really been a liaison to all the different departments\nSpeaker 7: . We've increased capacity with two positions. We have equity champions in each department. We've implemented racial equity one on one trainings. And a real big part of our response to COVID this year was our Vaccine Equity and Outreach Subcommittee that worked with the community providing vaccine opportunities in the hardest hit neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 7: The Recovery Act does support our racial reconciliation plan. We have in that plan youth academic programing at libraries. There is funding for youth life coaching and mentoring, expanding our Be Safe program for parks activities at night, expanding our Long Beach, Activating Safe Communities program that has been working in the Washington neighborhood and expanding that to others in\nSpeaker 7: high impact communities. Creating a reentry pilot program to reintegrate services for people that are reentering from incarceration, investing in economic empowerment zones, funding for community land trust, research and investment. Strong programs around digital inclusion. Inclusion for businesses and residents.\nSpeaker 7: A mental health crisis response pilot that's underway and under development. And our youth workforce development programs. Normally we have a long list of some of the new critical investments added. Normally with one time funds or one time funds, we're less this year than they've been in the past, given the the significant fiscal challenges.\nSpeaker 7: So it's a smaller list, but here it is. Here they are. We're investing in a diversity recruitment, mentorship and partnership partnership program in the police department, 220,000, which is structurally funded within the police budget for helping the workforce reflect our diverse community.\nSpeaker 7: We have a similar program in the fire department, 250,001 times, which is continuing that program from last year. We invested 2.18 million and our requirements for elections and redistricting. Those are both charter amendments and have specific timelines and deadlines that need to be funded.\nSpeaker 7: And then we have a number of commitments from previous years that were planned many years ago to come due in this budget, one of which was our brand new Wrigley greenbelt, which we got funding for, and it's now being implemented.\nSpeaker 7: And then we're launching a large new downtown park, and it'll be completed and opened in 2022. And so that park needs both maintenance and programing. One of the areas for new investment is measure us, and that is a subsection of funding that went to voters and was recommended by the Council to Fund Children and Youth Services, Community\nSpeaker 7: Health and Climate Change. We're very happy to announce that the Council gave us direction about a youth fund and that's been created as part of the city council or part of the budget to invest in youth and youth services informed by all of our strategic plans, reconciliation and other planning efforts.\nSpeaker 7: And this is a brand new program. So I want to tell the council, we're just starting we're listening to everything that we heard from you and the community. And we made a proposal, but we know this is going to get some adjustment any time you adopt a new program like this.\nSpeaker 7: So we're very open to that. We're flexible to hear the ideas of the community and the council on that. And so the staff proposal is to create a youth fund in the amount of $918,000. That would include $200,000 of direct youth community based grants where they can apply and get funding for the most important things in the\nSpeaker 7: community. A youth ambassador program where we're hiring youth and training them in our parks, continuing the model from CARES. And then as those youth move on to other opportunities, hiring more youth in their place and having a standard program that can help out in our parks and teach a valuable skills as well to our youth steam and\nSpeaker 7: ecosystem programing. This is library services programing. We're focusing on science and technology and math and arts, youth mental health programing, continuing the Long Beach Youth Summit every single year, and also funding to communicate all the facts that are happening with our youth and data management.\nSpeaker 7: And looking at the plan and supporting that commission, we would fund 155,000 in community health. We have in the past created an older adult program that's been very important to the community. It's always been funded with some one times or something dollars that were available, and this would create actual structural support for the older adult program and\nSpeaker 7: also support our staffing in our racial equity efforts. And then finally, climate. This is taking pieces of the climate addict adaptation and adaption plan and $243,000 to invest in things like community based organization grants for farms and community gardens and teaching gardens.\nSpeaker 7: We would have more field work programs for youth and help to expand our neighborhood tree planting. We had a council item that asked about tree planting throughout the city and how can we enhance our resources. And this would help with that.\nSpeaker 7: And also creating an electric lawn equipment program. HMD has one and this would be helping supplement that for Long Beach people in need. Measure A continues to provide all the past restorations, public safety, maintenance and administrative support. And we have 2.5 million to be able to keep the budget status quo.\nSpeaker 7: And June 17 was funded in 21. It was set to not be funded in 22. And so this would continue. That is as per our our philosophy this year, to keep going for one more year through one time dollars and measuring.\nSpeaker 7: We have $2.2 million for our Neighborhood Safe Streets Initiative in the police department. For a number of years, we've been planning that this year would be the year that measure would support our public safety radio replacement cost. So this is radio communication systems for police and fire that's antiquated and needs to be updated.\nSpeaker 7: Supporting community hospital, $4 million and then 20.8 million for infrastructure, which also includes funding our police and fire academy renovations and other infrastructure, as well as a new $4.0 million or $4 million for ADA sidewalk compliance and curb requirements.\nSpeaker 7: We have a robust capital improvement plan that you are going to have a very specific section on. We'll come to you and deconstruct the CP and talk about all the projects there. It's 470 million. The harbor is a big portion of that.\nSpeaker 7: But the next two biggest categories are utilities and mobility and mobility as all of our street work. And that's $51.8 million for streets and sidewalks. The General Fund is balanced with one times. So it's a balanced budget, but there is a significant amount of one time funding that we need to disclose.\nSpeaker 7: So it's not a structural solution there and it will need to be addressed in FY 23. So that structural shortfall in 22 for the next year I'm sorry, the original structural shortfall is $27 million for this year and then 3 million in additional one time costs, which is covered by the Recovery Act.\nSpeaker 7: And so while this isn't our normal strategy for addressing budgets, this was an amazing, incredible year. And reserves are there for a reason. And and one time dollars have come in to help us. And so that's really why we're recommending the to do this for one year.\nSpeaker 7: And also, we know that this budget doesn't support everything. There are a number of things the council asked for, the community asked for that we're underfunded in our departments. We try to disclose the the big items of that in the budget, including all the items that have come from the city council that have some funding or partial\nSpeaker 7: funding. Those are listed in an attachment with links to the two fund for us for easy reading. So what is our general fund fiscal outlook look like? So in 22 we are balance, but in 23 we have a $9 million surplus, but we have to carry over the shortfall from the previous year.\nSpeaker 7: That's 27 million. So it's a total of 36, which is a lot. That is a big number. 24 is another $11 million to solve and 25 is another nine. So this also includes that we are expecting some recovery revenue of the next couple of years.\nSpeaker 7: But we do know that our revenues are just growing slower than our expenses and that fact still remains. We do assume that we're going to win the measure and litigation currently seems likely given that Sacramento won their case.\nSpeaker 7: Otherwise, 23 would be about $9 million worth, and it's going to be a high priority in 22, beginning earlier to develop approaches to address that structural shortfall. So we've had a number of meetings already on the budget in March and April and July, and now we really turn to our community budget meetings, the BRC meetings.\nSpeaker 7: It's it's a proposed budget and it's really in the council's hands. This is one of the most important things the council does every year is consider the manager's budget, look at mayor recommendations, and then listen to the community and make those tough decisions.\nSpeaker 7: There are many opportunities for community engagement. You can attend budget hearings, attend community budget meetings, attend Bossi meetings. We have our Long Beach survey on funding priorities. And we're also, when we do the outreach, going to be working on the Long Beach strategic plan as well, and engaging residents per the council's request to get additional input on\nSpeaker 7: our strategic plan. And so I will finish with saying that this is an amazing city. It's a city committed to moving onwards and upwards. We say that a lot here. City of many accomplishments, a full service city, a wide variety of amazing services.\nSpeaker 7: We address our challenges head on. We don't shirk from them. We have such committed, dedicated employees who have just done extraordinary work throughout the pandemic to address and recover. And we have very strong leadership from our policymakers, our mayor and city council, and couldn't do this without the support and collaboration of our city auditor, our city attorney\nSpeaker 7: , our prosecutor, our city clerk, our civil service executive director, our harbor executive director and our water general manager. And that concludes the presentation, and we're available for questions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. And we are going to go to before I go to the council. I just want to also add that we say every year that this is just the first of these hearings. So there will be opportunities for out throughout the entire budget process where there will be different departments, of course, that will come\nSpeaker 0: forward and plenty opportunities for questions of specific departments in the future if the council has those. I do have a motion in a second to receive and file for this hearing the report, but I want to I councilman's already mentioned that she wants to hear I think there's four members of the public that have signed up.\nSpeaker 0: So let's hear the former members of the public and then we'll go to Councilwoman Sorrell. And then I'll just I'll just read them up here. If these four members could please come forward in this order, I believe it, says Jamil Ochoa or Jamil Ochoa, Karen Reside, Abraham Zavala and Jordan Winn.\nSpeaker 0: Or if those four folks could come forward, please. Jamil Ochoa. Karen Reside, Abraham Zavala and Jordan Winn.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor and council members and city manager and city staff. My name is Joe Miller and I am a community organizer with the Long Beach Immigrants Rights Coalition. I want to start off by asking you a question for you to reflect on.\nSpeaker 2: Can we count on the city council to fund programs like the Long Beach Justice Fund that will give legal representation to loved ones that have been kidnaped out of their homes to be put into ICE vehicles. I'm here as part of the People's Budget Coalition as I multicultural and Multi-generational Alliance.\nSpeaker 2: I am calling on Mayor Garcia and all nine City Council members and the city city manager to one adopt the people's budget for fiscal year 2022 and structurally reform the city budget process to enable earlier and deeper participation from marginalized communities who are most impacted by budget decisions.\nSpeaker 2: You must make public comments accessible to the communities who deserve to be part of this process, but can't be here today because of their vulnerability to COVID 19. When is this coming back to City Council? We believe that Black Lives Matter and that our communities cannot wait any longer.\nSpeaker 2: As the devastating impacts a public health crisis meets the harms inflicted by systemic racism and decades of immigrant attacks, anti-immigrant attacks, the accumulation of injustices facing immigrant communities has reached a tipping point. The need for urgent action to sustain and expand universal representation is more important now than ever.\nSpeaker 2: Immigrants of color feel the double oppression that comes from overpolicing which are giving way too much funding to from the both law enforcement and immigration enforcement. I am here today to demand that the city allocate 600,000 already promised from the Lumbee Justice Fund through a key for the structure of funding agreed upon last year and 300 Cree\nSpeaker 2: from the American Rescue Plan promised towards the Long Beach Justice Fund earlier this year. Our government is responsible for ensuring that everyone has equal access to the care that they need. This is the government's responsibility to use our tax dollars to protect the fundamental rights, health and safety of everyone in our communities.\nSpeaker 2: Universal representation ensures that the representation in immigration system operates in racially equitable way by ensuring legal representation. It helps us dismantle the present deportation pipeline and advances racial justice. We must work towards spending less city funding on policing and more on communities.\nSpeaker 2: I'm going to see that one more time. We must stop, start working towards spending, less funding on policing and more on our communities without a process to legal representation. Immigrants are facing deportation and an already unjust system alone.\nSpeaker 2: Let's please remember that the budgets are moral documents. They must represent the priorities of our communities needs and.\nSpeaker 1: That your time is up. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Hi. My name is Karen. Resign. I'm here tonight with the Long Beach Gray Panthers and we also are on the People's Budget Partnership Coalition. And I'm here tonight to address one of the last big isms that I had hoped hoped to see more in the budget this year.\nSpeaker 4: And it's sadly lacking. Ageism and ageism. We're working on the younger part of that. We've done a lot of good things with the youth, but it seems like our older people don't exist. 155,000. And I assume that's for Bixby Knolls, which isn't even really acceptable as a senior center.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm here tonight to address some of the issues. Three years ago, the city entered into the Livable Cities Initiative with AARP, which was to examine the impacts that our city had related to older adults. So far, we've done nothing for that.\nSpeaker 4: We also established the Healthy Aging Center at the Health Health Department, which has not been funded and certainly has done a main and amazing job with no money. And here we are scrambling as volunteers try and find funny find money for a plan that was not even done appropriately.\nSpeaker 4: It was based on a ten year old plan that doesn't include any input from baby boomers. And I have very different needs from someone that was the greatest generation. So the plan that we're using is way out of date.\nSpeaker 4: It's time we invest some money into the needs of our seniors. When I was young, my grandmother used to go visit her every weekend. She lived here and she came to Long Beach because it was such a wonderful city for older adults.\nSpeaker 4: I can't say that today. You know, we have to fight to get transportation. They haven't brought the passport back. Long Beach Transit is not talking about bringing the transport passport back, the senior center. Mr. Mayor, when you came and visited it two years ago, you said the city should be doing better for its seniors.\nSpeaker 4: Every day I watched the staff try and scramble and the two people that we lost during the pandemic haven't been replaced. So there are staff shortages and they're trying desperately to do programing with no supplies. The Great Panthers were lucky enough to get a couple of grants, so we've been trying to help buy decent furniture.\nSpeaker 4: The furniture is all falling apart. They replaced two floors and two spaces, but not the main spaces. So they still have gaps. They're broken. They're trip hazards for seniors. Right now, senior centers is not safe for seniors to be in.\nSpeaker 4: For a city our size. We should have ten senior centers and they should be standalone senior centers. But that's what the recommendations for Parks and Recreation Association. So we only have really one prestige standing senior centers there were way behind.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, council members. My name is Abraham Zavala.\nSpeaker 5: I'm with Long Beach. Residents Empowered, who is also part of the Language Arts Coalition. And our coalition is also a part of the People's Budget Coalition as well. I want to begin by acknowledging the liberated leaders who are watching right now online who couldn't be here to make public comment in person.\nSpeaker 5: And also, my children, they're.\nSpeaker 6: Watching online as well right now. So just want to say hi to them or else when I get home they're going to.\nSpeaker 5: Tell me something or that to say. I think it's important to keep engaging telephonically. I know there are other ways of giving folks access. So I want to share the language access coalition's budget demands that we feel would make an.\nSpeaker 6: Impact in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 5: Language is important, and I think oftentimes that can be a barrier for a lot of our folks that are different communities, right to access government, other functions as well. So we want to uplift the following three items. First, we like to have the city dedicate adequate staff to implement the Language Access Program consistently throughout the city and\nSpeaker 5: create a culture of language. Just as in Long Beach, we feel that can be best be achieved by hiring two full time program coordinators at 200,001, full time program assistant as well at 85 for a total of 35,000.\nSpeaker 5: Second, bear with me. It's very specific. Primarily move interpretation and translation services in-house to provide a faster and higher quality response to residents who need interpretation and translation. Provide Spanish and more interpretation at our City Council and Charter Commission meetings without having to make a request in advance that is so helpful for folks to come and make\nSpeaker 5: public comment whenever that's possible. So that would be something that would make an impact. So we're asking for ten Spanish interpreters, six camera interpreters, four Tagalog interpreters as city staff at an estimated 140,000 per to a total of to 2,000,800.\nSpeaker 5: Third demand is to provide community based organizations who work with Aleppo residents ongoing stipends to conduct outreach about the policy. Such organizations have a deep community relationship, trust and cultural competency to do that kind of outreach to effectively communicate with residents about their rights specifically and how to access city services for a total budget amount of 3,285,000\nSpeaker 5: . We feel that's fair, given that oftentimes, even when you call in over the phone, folks sometimes don't get through to the department, they need to get through. So we feel this would make a huge impact. So thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 6: Hello. And thank you. My name is Jordan Winn. I'm a District two resident in the city of Long Beach. My theme for the city budget today is to move past symbolic actions.\nSpeaker 7: And move towards permanent actions. Last year, thanks to the advocacy of the People's Budget Coalition, we.\nSpeaker 6: Sent many of the things that were were reflected in the city's budget last year, and many of those pilots.\nSpeaker 7: Are.\nSpeaker 6: Continuing. We thank you for that. Last year, we also saw a decrease in the city's proposed police budget.\nSpeaker 7: By $5 million. Tonight, we see an increase probably coming in within the fiscal budget itself, $15 million of increase coming our way. We need to move past symbolic measures and start dedicating ourself wholeheartedly with the millions of dollars that go there into community resources instead.\nSpeaker 6: Not hundreds of thousands of.\nSpeaker 7: Dollars for our seniors, for our families, but millions. We need to start investing those real dollars. I'm here to present three specific items from the Housing Justice Coalition of Long Beach that are three budget priorities that build on some of the things that the people's budget brought forth last year.\nSpeaker 7: One is a dedication to the rental housing division. We're very grateful to the City Council for dedicating $1 million from the Long Beach Recovery Act for the creation of three temporary housing navigator positions. And we now call on the city to build on that commitment and fund the creation of a permanent, structurally funded and fully staffed rental\nSpeaker 7: housing division within development services.\nSpeaker 5: The Rental Housing Division would be staffed by one division officer full time, two planners.\nSpeaker 7: Full time, two administrative analysts, three assistant.\nSpeaker 6: Military analysts, two clerks, and one deputy city attorney. We've broken it down very.\nSpeaker 7: Granularly, and it is this kind of service that is very necessary to maintain the large housing stock that we have within our city. And as we continue to expand and grow as a wonderful city that we are, this is going to become a.\nSpeaker 6: Greater and greater need for us locally.\nSpeaker 7: Number two is tenant rights of council. We are asking for $7 million of that. There was a pilot program launched last year, dedicated $250 million, one time in the fiscal year 2021 budget for right to counsel. The city further acknowledged the need for additional funding by allocating $900,000 to right council for the Long Beach Recovery Act, which\nSpeaker 7: will be spent fully over the next two years. We really do appreciate that this dedication is coming out from the city.\nSpeaker 6: And we want the city to go further. We call on.\nSpeaker 7: The city to fully fund this crucial program, which.\nSpeaker 6: Has only received partial.\nSpeaker 7: Funding thus far. Black and indigenous people of color and tenants throughout the city are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\nSpeaker 6: As we've seen.\nSpeaker 7: Are still waiting on funding, and Long Beach needs a fully funded right to counsel program to prevent mass displacement. Finally, we call on the city to continue to invest in community.\nSpeaker 6: Land trusts.\nSpeaker 7: Calling on 4000.\nSpeaker 6: Sorry.\nSpeaker 7: $4,750,000 from the fiscal year 2022 budget. To fund the remaining balance of our original budget ask, we're thankful for the original allocation of $1 million from the Long Beach Recovery Act. And once again, we ask the city to go further for our low income black indigenous tenants of color who've been disproportionately impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic\nSpeaker 7: . Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. I want to thank you for the very public comments. We're going to go back to the council and I'll start with Councilwoman Sorrell.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. You know, I want to thank the members of the public for making their comments. And I also want to thank our amazing city staff, city manager and the mayor's leadership for in the past year of navigating us through such a challenging time with the pandemic.\nSpeaker 2: So I know that that's been one of the things that's been mentioned earlier, how we've also been just impacted financially in so many ways. But I also just want to lift up our amazing residents who have been there for each other and protected each other by providing mutual aid and assistance.\nSpeaker 2: While we are not yet out of the pandemic, I think that it's an amazing, you know, the way that our city staff and mayor as well is helping us lead into the recovery part and grateful for the federal and state funding that's making it possible.\nSpeaker 2: You know, I just want to make sure to left out, you know, of the 249 million of federal and state funds, that 108.5 million of it is specifically for our healthy and safe community, which is going into our community.\nSpeaker 2: That's ranging from early childhood education and support to the physical and mental health equity to violence prevention and safe cities and homelessness. So I really want to make sure we lift that up because a lot of money is being invested into our community and particularly want to make sure to point out that 600,000 is going to the\nSpeaker 2: justice fund and 700,000 is going to the language access. Supporting and language access are so important to me and ensuring that, you know, we're making sure, you know, we're able to communicate across various languages as well as accessibility as well.\nSpeaker 2: But I just want to mention of the 700 million for our language. Access and 600,000 for the Justice one. It's the most we've ever funded in these two areas, as well as our source 1.8 million into the digital inclusion.\nSpeaker 2: So many amazing thing. I know it was a lot of information thrown at all of you and we're hoping that, as you know, this comes up over time and that it's various opportunities for engagement, that there are opportunities for more digestion of the information shared and better dialog and more dialogs that can be had in the community\nSpeaker 2: and with each other about it. So that's just what I wanted to make sure that provide to share. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Before I go to Councilman Manga, I do want to just add to that because I think she had mentioned two items that I had was chatting with someone earlier about it. Just it's important to note that the justice fund is as is at $600,000.\nSpeaker 0: When you look at the full budget, which is the largest allocation it's had. And so it's something I strongly support and I know the community supports and I think that we have seen those resources put to work and how important they are to ensure legal protection for people that are incredibly vulnerable and that need our support as\nSpeaker 0: a community. In addition, I just want to say on the language access question that Councilman Sara brought up, Mr. Monaco, you also we don't have to do it today, but I think there's also I know that the 700,000 direct allocation is the largest direct allocation we've made.\nSpeaker 0: But I think that there's also resources within language access that is kind of split among departments or that you've put into other departments. So the actual number, I think is a lot larger. Is that right?\nSpeaker 7: Absolutely. It actually in FY 22, if when you total up all the programs that we do for language access, it's $3.2 million. So we can break that out for you. There is the staffing in the city manager's office, about $323,000.\nSpeaker 7: We then have, you know, $250,000 in the Recovery Act budget. We then have our health department budget and our economic development budget. And then we also pay a number of city staff members to be bilingual. And that's about $1.8 million, $1.9 million, so that they're always available to the community.\nSpeaker 7: So I'd like to have one of our follow up items be to break this down for you so that we can get a truer picture of language access.\nSpeaker 0: Appreciate that. And I know I've had I was chatting with someone from the Language Access Coalition. I think there just needs to be a they just want to kind of understand at least what's in the current budget and how it's broken up.\nSpeaker 0: And so that way I think I think it'd be helpful for the community and for the council to have a better understanding of how those resources are are divided up in the city. So we can have a better idea of that.\nSpeaker 0: So but thank you, Councilwoman Sara, for for the for the bringing up those items. Let me go to Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And I think that and I don't want to speak for Councilmember Odinga, but a long time we've been fighting about language access and the movement forward. And I think that what has really come of it is not about an allocation.\nSpeaker 4: And I think that in many of my one on ones with community groups we talk about it's not about an allocation, it's about a full integration into the city as a component of what we do, period. It's a part of what we do and there isn't an amount that it is limited to or associated with.\nSpeaker 4: It's everything needs to be available in the languages. And specifically we've talked about and different departments have different needs and have different access to different communities and have more need or less need. And from year to year, those adjustments just need to be made so that people have access period.\nSpeaker 4: So just to follow up on that. Page 12 of the presentation talks about rental assistance. It's my understanding that additional funds have become available July one through the state budget, but we had previously closed the window on the rental assistance funds.\nSpeaker 4: Do we plan to reopen it because of these new funds?\nSpeaker 7: So we had extended our rental assistance program twice and we are incorporated those new funds into the third revision. So the 51 million includes the new money that we got as well, and that's now in the recovery plan.\nSpeaker 7: That's part of the reason it went up from 235 up into to 49.\nSpeaker 4: So do we believe we have applicants for that much funding?\nSpeaker 6: We do.\nSpeaker 7: So when we assessed it over the weekend, we were looking at July 11th as the date we had contemplated potentially extending it, but we did a big push on social media, on outreach, and we got enough applications to fulfill the whole $51 million.\nSpeaker 7: And we're currently. So we closed it and we're going through the process with applicants to help them with all the paperwork that they need to file for federal and state reimbursement.\nSpeaker 4: And when do we think that money will be operationalized and in the hands of the community?\nSpeaker 7: Some of it's gone out already. I sent out an update, I think a week and a half ago. I can get you a new one. At that point, several million dollars had already gone out. And we have just it's a big process to go through that.\nSpeaker 7: And we let checks out every single week when we get those applications done.\nSpeaker 4: So we think six weeks, eight weeks.\nSpeaker 7: I don't have that answer right now. I don't know if Oscar or Christopher does. Christopher's got a better handle on it.\nSpeaker 6: Council member, we expect about $2 million to go out the door this week and then we expect the amount of going out the door to increase each week over the coming six weeks. So in 6 to 8 weeks, we will have paid out a very large portion of the rental assistance, but then we'll be into the very\nSpeaker 6: difficult cases. So we have cases where one party or the other isn't cooperating or there's a paperwork problem or there's audit trail problem. So it's hard for me to say everything will be paid in eight weeks. Most things will be paid in eight weeks.\nSpeaker 6: But then when we get to the really difficult ones, it'll take us all the way until December 31st to pay out those more difficult cases.\nSpeaker 4: Wonderful. Thank you for that information. I want to take a pause from my questions because I kind of move things around based on other comments of my colleagues. And I just want to thank the staff. I know not everybody spends the time.\nSpeaker 4: The moment these books are released, my staff know they come to my house immediately or I drive to City Hall and get them. I spent the weekend with these books and I love what you've done with them. We've come a really long way.\nSpeaker 4: You've always been excellent, but the amount of work that you've put in this year, the different layouts that you've adopted, the more easy to read sections. For those of you who don't know, when people call my office and ask questions, I reference the book and I send them the PDF and I think that this is more user\nSpeaker 4: friendly. And so what I meet with community groups and we have questions. The quality of this book makes a difference and I really think it's a reflection of the staff and the efforts and the training. I have to say my favorite part is that you have our fiscal or fiscal policies in the beginning of the book.\nSpeaker 4: I think that's a really important reminder and I really appreciate and through the work that we did together for several years to get these right, that they're front and center for people to remember why we do what we do and why it's important to be with our revenue projections and how we handle each and every component of\nSpeaker 4: this book. So and I think that that will really help for years to come. So I want to thank the staff for all the work that went into this. And not just the budget staff. The budget staff that are in the facility manager's office are critical and important, but there are also a lot of staff out in\nSpeaker 4: departments and a lot of those staff are stretched really thin and taking multiple hats in the department at this time. And so I want to take an extra special moment to thank you, filling out all the reports and requirements and projections that the city manager's office requests are not easy.\nSpeaker 4: I just look forward to seeing more details in the police budget about the least cost of the radio. That just sounded like a high number for lease costs versus purchase price. I don't know a lot about it, so I don't know if we're frontloading it and putting in a reserve account or maybe I can go into that\nSpeaker 4: at that presentation and then I look forward to additional details on measure use and what that's going to look like on the granular level when we get there. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 6: RICHARDSON Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thanks city staff for the presentation. I was able to watch the budget reveal the other day, so I got a bit of a head start on some of this and I'm sure most of the community has to.\nSpeaker 6: I just want to acknowledge the speakers who came forward I think is really good. And I think I don't remember if it was Jordan or someone who kind of articulated, you know, last year's budget, then the recovery, the pieces that the community advocated for and have made it in, I think is important.\nSpeaker 6: The community should be proud of those achievements and the council should be proud of those achievements. These are significant investments that helped shape the region. Other people pay attention to these impacts. You know, enough members of the council spoke to the justice, foreign language, access and things like that.\nSpeaker 6: But we know that there's always more to do and we have a good organizing base in our community that will continue to push the city, and that's just the dynamics of inside outside. And so we know that there's certainly much more to do.\nSpeaker 6: But I do want to say, you know, context is important. This time last year, we were I think we were talking about relief efforts and sick days, and we were in a very, very different place. And to have a budget in front of us with no service cuts at a time when our services are already stretched, strained\nSpeaker 6: , I think is important. And it would not have been possible if it hadn't been for the federal relief that we're fortunate to receive the CARES Act. We didn't originally receive that. We were just shy of the 500,000 we had to go agitate to get resources.\nSpeaker 6: So the fact that we're in a place where we don't have cuts, I think that's important context because we're not out of the clear. This is the very, very beginning of a recovery. But we are not out of the out of the woods.\nSpeaker 6: Our revenues have not recovered. We're in a different place. And I think we need to understand that now. There are some good things that I'm proud of in this in this budget. Some new things measure us and and, you know, some of the recovery dollars.\nSpeaker 6: I think it's important that the reconciliation came up a lot. And, you know, I think I think that we need to make sure that we are keeping score and telling the story outwardly of the way the reconciliation is shaped.\nSpeaker 6: A lot of this and, you know, it was organized in a way there was immediate, immediate mid-term, long term investments. And there's actually a really good story to tell on some of the immediate and the short term and medium term investments.\nSpeaker 6: And I want to see us tell that story a bit better. We launched the Office of Youth Development this year. That's important. We're investing in violence prevention. That's important. We didn't have staff for violence prevention before we adopted Measure US.\nSpeaker 6: That was called out in the reconciliation plan the voters adopted. That opens up the playbook, allows us we'll talk a little bit more about that. But I think that opens up the playbook, allows some down payments on some really important things like the youth fund.\nSpeaker 6: There's policy things in front of in front of us that we know some we move forward on that were called out inclusionary housing inclusive play box checked. There are some things that still are outstanding we know we need to do CPK reform.\nSpeaker 6: We funded the study. We look forward to closing that out and putting in front of the voters. You have a health equity center called out. There's an item this evening talking about the health equity center. There's alternative. A big, big item was alternative clinical response model that was big over the course of the past year.\nSpeaker 6: And we look forward to the update and where we are with alternative clinical response model. That's that's important the community that's for that and a whole host of other things that are really creative people have advocated for a long time.\nSpeaker 6: I've advocated for some of these for a long time, like down payment assistance, economic empowerment zones. Some of the economic inclusion work called out everyone in the community land trust. These are really, really good ideas and strategies that have been funded.\nSpeaker 6: And I look forward to an update where we can look comprehensively at where we are now in terms of major U.S. that that really I'm glad to see that here. Mary has opened up the playbook and we're fortunate to the voters for making that happen.\nSpeaker 6: I'm glad to see the great majority that almost $1,000,000 invested in youth. We need to make sure that you know we go back to particularly we invest in youth coalition is push for our youth fund for a very long time we're going to have a community discussion, a youth town hall with them on August 5th to take\nSpeaker 6: a deeper dove and hear directly from youth about now this is possible and the reality. What do we need to consider? I think the investments in community health from us I think is a great start. We've talked about investing as seniors in aging adults, the fact that we're going to have funding to dedicate now to that to\nSpeaker 6: help build out that program I think is good. And I think with climate, the goal was to have funding to leverage, to amplify the impact on accelerating our climate action adaptation plan. And what you see is an alignment that allows us to go out to groups like AQAP and others and multiply the impact on our climate resiliency\nSpeaker 6: programs. So we only have 5 minutes immaculate later, but we only have 5 minutes. But but I think these are things that I think need to be discussed in this budget and the things that in general, as an implementation point, we need to be better at telling the story and communicating outwardly the work, the good work that's\nSpeaker 6: happening within the city and understand the delta of where we still need to push.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilor Marie Ranga.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And I want to follow up on Vice Mayor Richardson's comments regarding the discussions we're going to have in the future. On slide 27, you have a schedule there of hearings, and we're going to be coming up.\nSpeaker 3: And I know that three of those are going to be out in the community and encouraging the community to please come out to those public hearings so we can hear you and and share your thoughts and ideas as to how we can build a better budget for the city of Long Beach or build one at least that\nSpeaker 3: is strong and addresses all the needs that we have at the city. I also want to make sure that we are inclusive in our budget hearings that we have. We have all four points of our city east, west, north and south to make sure that there is an ample opportunity for people from all over the city to\nSpeaker 3: attend these hearings. One of the most important things that I think came up for me anyway. And I want to thank Councilmember Mungo and Councilmember Sarah, of course, our mayor, for bringing up the issues related to language access.\nSpeaker 3: Everybody knows that this has been a very important item for me in regards to communication, being able to talk to our people, to our residents from all languages, from all backgrounds, because we can't if we don't have and we don't speak their language.\nSpeaker 3: And so that's very important. And I'm glad that city manager, you brought up some issues there that are that are internal, that are actually built in to our language access program, such as bilingual staff. I know I can speak to it from a historical perspective.\nSpeaker 3: I used to be the the bilingual language assessor providing the skimpy. So I know that there are city staff out there who are receiving the skill page, but obviously it's not enough. We need a lot more and we probably need to budget it more.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm looking forward to those discussions and those hearings when we can throughout the city. Is there going to be a specific schedule in regards to what departments are going to be reviewed in these budget hearings as we move along, like, for example, August 3rd, August 10th, in August 17th, which I think are the three that you\nSpeaker 3: have scheduled in the community before we get our first adoption date of August 24th. I'm especially interested in in those departments that are non non city manager departments. I'm talking specifically about civil service department. I mean, they're they're the biggest department that does all our employment testing.\nSpeaker 3: They test for basically all jobs in the city. And that's where also the the bilingual skill comes in with the civil service department in regards to testing that these individuals apply for for these skilled jobs do, in fact, possess.\nSpeaker 3: So is there going to be a release of of a schedule of what departments are going to be coming to the city council or rephrase it to the budget hearings in the future?\nSpeaker 7: Yes. So we do have a proposal. We do this every year where we identify certain departments and then we get council feedback. And it's important that we get consensus. We have 23 departments and it's hard to do every single one and be efficient with your time.\nSpeaker 7: So we do want to get input from you on that. You can go through what those are. We had originally planned on kind of focusing since the changes are really in the Recovery Act that we focus a lot of the presentations on those that are getting resources and programs in the Recovery Act.\nSpeaker 7: So to.\nSpeaker 2: Council member. We have a budget hearing next on August 3rd for the CIP presentation. Then on August 10th, we have the health department and the police department presenting. And then on August 17th, we have the fire department and Economic Development Department presenting.\nSpeaker 2: And then two weeks following that or the following week, we have our first budget adoption night on August 24th.\nSpeaker 3: This is a pretty aggressive schedule. So I'm guessing, Mayor, that we're trying to adopt our budget while before September 30th or the date that we actually have to?\nSpeaker 0: No, I mean, the council always can adopt it whenever it would like up until that date. I think we also released the budget was also, I think probably out probably about two weeks earlier than normal. So I think the staff is adjusting for that time.\nSpeaker 0: So I think normally we probably have this conversation like two weeks from now or the first budget presentation. So I think it's just an adjustment for that. But we can I think any time the council wants to add an apartment to one of these sessions, I think we're able to just let Mr. Morgan to go at it\nSpeaker 3: . Yeah, I did have a brief discussion with Mr. Moore today about a presentation, and since I'm making a request also to include an department, perhaps we could do it at that time as well, or be able to accommodate other department presentations at a at a hearing if we need to adjust a just a schedule a little bit\nSpeaker 3: by, you know, the August 24 or when we back the August 24 through the seventh and the seven to the 14th.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And I would and I know that I would, I would connect definitely. I know that Councilmember Austin is not here, but I know that he's working on the schedule with staff as well. So definitely want to connect with him as well and we'll go from there.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman and the house.\nSpeaker 2: Mayor And first of all, thank you for that great presentation to city staff, especially financial management. Thank you very much. Agree with most all of the comments being said by my colleagues tonight. One of my top priorities as a councilwoman is public safety.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's crucial for our city or our thriving city to be the best and make sure that our residents feel as safe as possible, especially our youth. I feel that they need to feel protected and our youth are usually seen as easy targets when they go alone to parks or, you know, to play basketball at the\nSpeaker 2: courts or even just walking home from school. So I wanted to see what if there was a if we could look into maybe the feasibility of establishing a program that would consist of police placing panic buttons throughout our parks, especially those that suffer the most violent crimes and and are most at risk.\nSpeaker 2: I think that, you know, if a child is in danger or feels harassed, that that would be something really good to have it where they could press the alert or the panic button and they could receive immediate help.\nSpeaker 2: I know that they have such a program like that at Cal State University, Long Beach, and would like to see what kind of feasibility that would be. And on another note, I think that one of the things that I've been like council member Ortega and Council member Sara Champion on is language access.\nSpeaker 2: One of the things that I worry about is not having the best interpretation for our residents when they come up and speak. You know, sometimes the the translation isn't as effective as it could be. So, again, I would like to see a feasibility on what it would be to to actually move the translation services in-house and actually\nSpeaker 2: be able to provide those, those individuals with training some of the wordings and terminology and words that we use during council meetings that we, our residents that don't speak English, can really get their true meaning across them by having by having these kinds of interpretations or employees that serve as interpreters in-house might be the best way to\nSpeaker 2: go. So I know we've we've been working really hard to get the best interpretation that we can get, but I think it would be very beneficial to us to have those in the house. So I'd like to see us look into that and let's see.\nSpeaker 2: And also I'd like to see us maybe look into the feasibility of building like community centers in the hardest hit neighborhoods with violent crimes. I think that prevent having programs that prevent violent crimes are are super important. So I'm really looking forward to seeing something like that.\nSpeaker 2: To be able to bring community centers to those particular areas, I think would be more than beneficial. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Let me go ahead and just add up again. No. Okay. So thank you to the to the council for those comments. There'll be obviously additional opportunities for the budget hearing that will continue on. I just want to just make a note of three other items, Mr. City Manager, I know we can discuss in the weeks\nSpeaker 0: ahead. And these are things that have been mentioned to me by some council members community. I want to just first highlight, I think, some of what Vice Mayor Richard Sutton said around measure U.S.. I think one thing that you and I mentioned at the presentation that we did to to the media and to the to the community\nSpeaker 0: , we, I think, obviously, staff put together a proposal for measure us that is a lot of work from a lot of departments. And I think we also recognize, and I certainly do that it's the first year that Measure USA is coming in and this was a community effort.\nSpeaker 0: And so I expect that there will be some dialog among the council and some strong thoughts about how that money should be spent in this first year. And so I think that staff should be ready to hear from council members.\nSpeaker 0: And as far as how those dollars should be, should be set aside, I think that broadly speaking, I think the proposal you guys have put together hits a lot of those major points, but I think there will be some dialog around that.\nSpeaker 0: So I just want to note that for the staff. I also want to note that I have had some conversations about, you know, in our in our budget, there is a proposal to change kind of how we do a helicopter patrol within the police department.\nSpeaker 0: And I think that's something that's been discussed in the past. And you send out information to the council in a memo. I do think that deserves broader discussion on this body this year as part of as part of this budget cycle as well.\nSpeaker 0: I think most of us are first and foremost concerned about safety and ensuring that the helicopter system that we have in place is able to do the work they need to do, particularly in across the city and and in support to other jurisdictions and vice versa.\nSpeaker 0: So I'd like to ask staff to be prepared to have that conversation in the weeks ahead. And then I also want I'd like to ask Steph about there are resources in this budget for digital inclusion. And what I'm really excited about is today there was this huge announcement.\nSpeaker 0: I mean, the governor signed a I think a six, $7 billion digital inclusion bill, which dwarfs the enormous amount of money that we put in our digital inclusion, which is exciting. So I would just like I think we said in the budget that maybe we put maybe 2 million for digital inclusion.\nSpeaker 0: 1.8.\nSpeaker 7: It's 1.8.\nSpeaker 0: So I support that. But what I'd like to know in the next couple weeks also is what how much, considering the author of the Digital Inclusion Bill lives in Long Beach and she's very committed to bringing those resources down here.\nSpeaker 0: I just want to see if there's an opportunity to, you know, dramatically increase what we're actually going to spend on digital inclusion and ensure that the dollars that we put aside are if that's where they should be and they likely should be.\nSpeaker 0: But I just want to make sure that we're looking at the digital inclusion part of money that got signed by the governor today. And I think for those that hadn't heard, this is probably the biggest digital, digital and broadband investment in the state of California to low income communities and to communities that are underserved by broadband.\nSpeaker 0: So it's going to be substantial for us in Long Beach or we are excited about that. And so with that, there is a motion and a second to continue the hearing to the next meeting and receive and file the information that was presented.\nSpeaker 0: So, Members, please cast your vote on that.\nSpeaker 5: Motion carries.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: The report at the Select Committee on Civic Arenas Agenda Item 12 Constable 119088 Relating to query and authorizing the merit executed memoranda of Understanding with Oak View Group LLC regarding the redevelopment of Key Arena into a world class, multi-purpose sports and entertainment arena and sales center, including its design, construction, lease financing and future operation exempting the redevelopment\nSpeaker 1: of future operation of the arena for the requirements of Chapter 20.47 Asset Code and ratify and confirming certain prior acts. The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 2: Very good. So sort of a housekeeping item. What I'll do generally is describe the the basic legislation sort of on a higher level. And then I know Councilmember Suarez, the co-chair, and sort of I'll say the leading chair in this effort will I think you may have some comments on the amendment.\nSpeaker 5: I'll do it. I'll do the comments and then I'll do the substitution.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then I believe Councilmember O'Brien and maybe some others like to say a few words. So let me just talk about the base legislation. And indeed, I want to thank everyone that came out to testify on what could be, I think some very exciting, I'll say, traction for the city.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's one of the strongest arena agreements in the council in the country. And, you know, we set out earlier about protecting our taxpayers and protecting our city from unnecessary risk. And all along, while I've looked at this particular deal, that's been my goal in in in a nutshell, the current project cost estimated around 600 million\nSpeaker 2: in all costs and potential cost overruns of construction and arena operations are the responsibility of the Oak View Group. And I think we made we've made that clear all along. At the end of the day, we should have a state of the art civic arena and that can attract musical events and in in those kinds of activities\nSpeaker 2: , as well as entertainment and sports events. And we think that the new arena design will certainly be ready for NBA and NHL teams. It's not contingent upon it, but certainly puts us, I think, in a driver's seat to attract that kind of activity.\nSpeaker 2: Redevelopment construction is estimated to begin at the end of 2018 for an opening in October of 2020, which I think is critically important as the community benefits agreement with community organizations as part of this deal to foster both equity and social justice and provide benefit to communities that will be affected by this arena.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that's a very significant part of what we're trying to do in this. This would entail programs for youth and arts and sports and music and cultural events. There's 20 million in in-kind or cash to nonprofit organizations, including $10 million dedicated to youth care.\nSpeaker 2: And we know the outstanding work that youth care does and the lives that they are changing, particularly for youth that need guidance and need to get on a better track. And so we're we're real impressed with that kind of work.\nSpeaker 6: You know.\nSpeaker 2: Part of our deal when we get very busy are to make sure that we have the resources to hire folks to protect our interests are as a city, our interests as a for residents, for for everyone that sort of needs a look under the stones to make sure there's no subtle language that can hurt our city.\nSpeaker 2: To that end, we hired David Abrams, who worked with the mayor and the council. His company is Inner Circle Sports. He's a consultant, provides sort of expert financial advice to the city. Another piece of that is our hiring of David Stone, who was our financial consultant who worked only for the city council.\nSpeaker 2: And of course, the city hired Karl Hirsch as sort of a city consultant to really stay on top of athletic events. A word about the NBA, if you really for those do it. And I have a few folks who really study the developments in the NBA.\nSpeaker 2: The current CBA runs to around 2023 to 2024 with a mutual opt out after 2020, 20, 20, 20, 22 to 2023. And NBA would likely to consider expansions right during that 2022 period. We all know the NBA has 30 teams right now and they could expand at 32.\nSpeaker 2: And you may recall that there weren't a lot of happy people in 2006 when Howard Schultz, who was the majority owner of the Sonics, sold to Clay Bennett from Oklahoma for that time it was 350 million. So certainly the stakes have changed.\nSpeaker 2: But I say that history to simply make this point that we are we've attracted a lot of capital just to the city to put us. In a position to both attract hockey and NBA. And there's no guarantees in this world on this these kinds of deals.\nSpeaker 2: But we brought significant resources to the city, structured a partnership agreement. I think that will work and protect our taxpayers. And I certainly will be supporting this legislation. And one note about the Soto Street issues, and we heard some testimony there, you may recall in 2016, the street vacation did not pass.\nSpeaker 2: That was a tough fight for vote. We're moving forward. That MLB we signed actually expired yesterday. I think it was. And we still have, I think, a good relationship with those those particular groups. And the line is always open.\nSpeaker 2: So nothing precludes ongoing conversations with Mr. Hansen or the folks. But this particular deal on its merits, and that's really critical on its merits, is a great deal for the city, at least in my humble opinion. Having said that, the one that was driving this, I want to recognize and relinquish the to and that will be Councilmember\nSpeaker 2: Juarez councilmember words. You have the floor.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, council president for all of you who are here today. Thank you very much for being here. I know it's been a long, a long year. Some of us started working on this in October of 2016 and has been with us for about 14 months, which is probably longer than my last relationship.\nSpeaker 5: Let me just start with this. I have some some basic words I want to put out there about and frame these issues, and then I will move to amend it with the the substitution memo that we worked out, and then I'll have more words to say after that.\nSpeaker 5: But I just want to be clear, because we we've had in the last nine months, we've had eight meetings and we've had a resolution and we've had a council letter and we've had many stakeholder groups. And I'll go through that list, that litany in a moment.\nSpeaker 5: I want to thank all of labor that showed up here today. I really want to thank you for being there. Seattle Storm, thank you so much. The Port, thank you so much. And all the business and all the Sonics fans.\nSpeaker 5: Of course, at the originally at the November 16 select committee meeting on Arenas, we had 13 amendments and we came to agree on seven of those, meaning that we built consensus and we voted on them and we agreed upon them.\nSpeaker 5: And then we had six amendments that we ended up changing, and those were the amendments and changes that we wanted renegotiated with our central staff director, Kirsten, our staff at our legal counsel, our outside experts who the President just mentioned, FASB, CBO, myself, Council President Harrell and of course, Councilmember Bagshaw representing District Number seven.\nSpeaker 5: We all successfully renegotiated all six of those amendments. And so what we have before us today is a substitute MCU to be attached to Council Bill 119088 so I'm going to withhold the rest of my comments until I make an official motion.\nSpeaker 5: So I move to amend Council Bill 119088 Attachment one by substituting version two for version one.\nSpeaker 2: So this is on the amendment only. Thank you, Councilmember. Whereas those in favor of substitution of the amendment, as stated by Councilmember Juarez, please vote i. I opposed. The ayes have it. So we have a substituted version and councilman words.\nSpeaker 2: Would you like to rest it to see if there are any other comments and then come back?\nSpeaker 5: We can do a two A's, I understand. Is there any I. I was ready to launch into my discussion, but if. How would you like to do it?\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'll tell you that I believe the base legislation is there. You could continue talking to any of my colleagues, have any comments to make on the base legislation or any ideas or thoughts, and that would be your time to make it, I guess.\nSpeaker 2: Remember what I.\nSpeaker 4: Do have comments on the base legislation, but I would like to resolve.\nSpeaker 2: Them. Okay, very good.\nSpeaker 5: So did you want me to just go forward then with what I was going to call on? Johnson. Okay, you're on. Is that is that a bobblehead on your in front of your.\nSpeaker 7: Yes, ma'am, it is.\nSpeaker 5: Where's my sales star bobblehead? Okay. So I'm going to launch into some some some important issues. And I'm going to ask the community to bear with me, because some of us have been dealing with this for a very long time.\nSpeaker 5: And it's important to acknowledge the people that have worked hard and over these last 14 months. On October 27th, 2016, then-Mayor Murray announced his intention to issue a RFP for to renovate key arena. Over the next several months.\nSpeaker 5: The executive would put together a team of people led by Brian Surratt, who's in the back of the room at the Office of Economic Development. This team included representatives from sales center ops, SSI, alphabet soup here Eastport, Department of Neighborhoods, Arts Law, the mayor's office and representatives from Council in the Legislative Department.\nSpeaker 5: That would be yours truly. Council President Harrell and Councilmember Bagshaw representing District Number Seven. Right from the beginning, council's voice was included. I can assure you of that. I had my first meeting with OED on November 23rd, 2016, to discuss the elements and deliverables of a potential RFP.\nSpeaker 5: Needless to say, I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas break with the red pen going through RFP and making sure when I spoke to my constituents and my colleagues on the floor that the issues that were of concern to them were baked right into the RFP.\nSpeaker 5: I was able to work with Director Armstead to provide direct feedback to the language of the RFP to make sure that council's priorities not only would be baked in according to transportation, but all the other issues. I want to thank Councilmember Herbert for her insight into labor and the issues that she thought should be highlighted.\nSpeaker 5: Councilmember Gonzales On the race and social justice issues. Councilmember should Johnson and O'Brien on the transportation issues and much, much more. There's a lot more there, but I'm not going to go on and on. The RFP was released on January 11th, 2017, and on February 20th February 2017, the Select Committee on Civic Arenas was announced.\nSpeaker 5: Council president, in his wisdom, decided that it would be better, and I agreed that myself. Council President Harrell and Councilmember Bagshaw, representing District seven, would attack this project as diligently with all the integrity in it, with all the speed due that this city needed and wanted since the Sonics had left.\nSpeaker 5: I do want to point out we do have Seattle Storm and that is a phenomenal team again. With that, I really want to thank our central staff director, Kirsten R for all her work, including down itr their work in representing the Council on both the initial negotiating team and in the subsequent negotiations to finalize the menu in\nSpeaker 5: front of us today. This has been a labor of love. Person has balanced the priorities of nine council members has been absolutely critical to the success of this project and did it all while doing the budget. I cannot think of anyone who has worked as hard and as closely with me whose professional integrity I would never, ever\nSpeaker 5: question. I want to acknowledge Robert Nelmes, the director of the Seattle Center, and Jill Query. Dr.. No, I'm sorry, Mr. NELMS. Director Nelms has been great to work with. He's always been a phenomenal advocate for what is best for Seattle Center and all the tenant organizations on the campus and in particular Seattle Storm.\nSpeaker 5: I would also again like to say thank you, Brian Surratt, for being a director and offering your leadership and bringing us together. I know we didn't always get along, but we got it done and I appreciate that. Even when I said bad words together with all the components of this project, for us to deliver it to my\nSpeaker 5: to my, to my colleagues and we we gave you a deadline back in July. We asked that the executive transmit to us an M.O. you on September 12th, and you did just that. I also want to thank the hard work of Carl Stickle.\nSpeaker 5: Carl, thank you very much for answering all our my dumb questions and well, I don't know Councilmember get back. Backchannels questions were dumb, but she had a lot of them as well. I want to thank the work of our consultants, as you heard the president say, David Stone, Carl Hirsch, David Abrams were phenomenal.\nSpeaker 5: Their expertize has been a great value to support counsel through this process. We have relied on their expertize, their professional integrity, their financial analysis, market conditions, and all the difficulties of Reimagining Seattle Center. And let me tell you, folks, it was no easy task.\nSpeaker 5: I also want to thank before I think my colleagues in particular and I need to read this list off because it's important. I've been living and breathing these and with these individuals in these groups for a long time.\nSpeaker 5: And I think what the public doesn't know behind the scenes is who these people are that actually roll up their sleeves, get out the spreadsheets, make us go through our exercise, ask all of our questions, and provide the document and do the due diligence.\nSpeaker 5: Ben Noble from the from the city budget office. Ben, thank you so much. Greg Nava legal. His analysis and superb legal advice has been phenomenal in Greg's. Try on a chair. I can see him sitting right there. Just in case we need him.\nSpeaker 5: I want to thank the staff from DCI Nathan Torkelson, or PKD, Sam Safir. Asafa Escort Scott Scooby. I would say that Scooby. I call him Scooby. That's why I'm saying that. And departure of neighborhoods, Kathleen Island. All of them provided essential feedback on the EMU particular thanks to council member Bagshaw and her staff, Lily and Alberta.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you so much. Working with my staff, it really was helpful obviously. And of course, Council Member Herrell. I want to thank Vin for the work that he did. A particular shout out to my staff. Ms.. Mercedes Elizalde.\nSpeaker 5: There she is in the back. Mercedes and I would have been attached to this for 13, 14 months, weekends, nights. This woman works the floor, gets the amendments, does the research. Another really big thank you. And I hope she's watching Shayna.\nSpeaker 5: We hired Shayna in Sept in January and her only job was to do all the research at the archives down here in Seattle, in City Hall and at the University of Washington. She pulled up all the op ed pieces, the original legislation, the ordinances, the letters from Congress to state, the city from the 1958 to 1962 for\nSpeaker 5: the World's Fair, because it was important for us to see the long term vision of what our civic leaders were thinking about in 1950 859. And believe me, that actually shaped a lot of our opinion about the isn't just about bringing back the Sonics.\nSpeaker 5: It's about a regional asset. And as I want to quote, Maggie, if some of you remember whoever Senator McGee was called, Seattle Center in the World's Fair and the Space Needle in the footprint, a jewel, the jewel of our city.\nSpeaker 5: And that's what we led with. We have two phenomenal groups. I'm going to duplicate a few names because they do show up a few times, but they had been phenomenal. The two groups that we work with their guidance, their comments, their assistance, their perseverance, their negotiating first.\nSpeaker 5: The first community group, Deborah Fastow from Uptown Alliance, Ali Garrett from Tabor 100. Nicole Grant, thank you very much. From Labor. Todd Humphrey. Megan Jasper. Jan Levy. Jill Nishi. The bill said this. Ron Rico, Quantum Drago. Ethan Stoll.\nSpeaker 5: Lenny Wilkins. Councilmember back and I had an opportunity to have lunch with the famous Mr. Wilkins and learned a lot about history and wisdom and what a team means. But not just the team, the whole spirit of the city coming together, and also his phenomenal support, of course, for Seattle Storm.\nSpeaker 5: The second group has been and will continue to lead the community involvement process in the execution of this development. Their guiding principles are an attachment to to the legislation. I want to thank Monte Anderson, John Barr, Robert Cardona, Andrea Capone, Evan Clifford, Brian Curry, Deborah Foster again.\nSpeaker 5: Allie Grant again. Nicole Grant again Michael McQuaid, Brian Robertson, Sarah Wilkie and Jane Slutsky. I could actually give you a lot more names and people in groups, but I won't. We could be here all for another 3 hours if I did that.\nSpeaker 5: But I do want to add one more thing before I finish. I want to thank the Seattle storm. In the letter, I had a chance to exchange some messages with Jenny. And thank you for the little lady that was here that read this yellow storm letter.\nSpeaker 5: I think the thing that was I found the most most poignant in her letter when it comes to the Seattle storm, because people always just talk about the Sonics. Even though they left us in their letter, they said something to me that really spoke to me about having a new arena and thanking us and being supportive because\nSpeaker 5: that they deserve to work and play basketball in an upgraded arena where the technology is state of the art, and where we have a building that keeps out the rain when we don't give consideration to other kind of sports, when it's only about male sports, we don't look at the other type of people that contribute to the\nSpeaker 5: city. In sports, I think you're missing out. And I also want to thank Seattle Storm because they have worked with us on the relocation efforts and also mitigating the franchise losses for those two years and have been very, very open and honest and good about how we can all work together to move them and take care of\nSpeaker 5: them while we go through this. If this gets past today, this change, I want to thank my council colleagues for their input throughout the process. Those of you who provided me in input, your comments, your drafts, your concerns during the RFP phase and our letter to the Executive in June and throughout the review process to identify the\nSpeaker 5: needed amendments to the menu, including the August resolution that passed unanimously, where we were very clear in our intent and resolve to build a world class arena for not only the city of Seattle, but for everyone in the state of Washington.\nSpeaker 5: This is such an amazing opportunity. Such an investment of this magnitude into the call center has not been seen since the days before the World's Fair in 1962. We see now how this is igniting a new age of female led sports with the young.\nSpeaker 5: Women of Washington Wild. That's the girls hockey team who consistently came to public comment to support this project. And as and as I shared our discussions with Seattle Storm today. If council votes to approve this MSU it it'll be the first step of many more to come over the next year.\nSpeaker 5: Council will be viewing several documents, as I shared before the development agreement, the lease agreement, the SEAL Integration Agreement, the EGIS, the Transportation Mobility Action Plan, the Community Benefits Agreement. With more work to come, I look forward to groundbreaking and grand opening.\nSpeaker 5: And I should add that working with OPG has been a pleasure. I've been a lawyer for 31 years and I've built many things and negotiated many things. I am proud that OPG gave $20 million to our community fund, that OPG agreed to MJ, that they gave 1% for the arts, that they of the 20,000,010 will go to\nSpeaker 5: youth care, that OPG has agreed to relocate and paid for the skate the skate park. And I could go on and on. But all of that is within the is within the ordinance and it's within the 50 page menu, which I think has seven attachments, if I'm correct.\nSpeaker 5: And so let me just end on this note. We work really hard on this. We made sure, I made sure Mercedes made sure, Councilor Bagshaw made sure President Harrell made sure that my colleagues not only had the benefit of all the material briefings, private briefings.\nSpeaker 5: We even went as far to make each council member a notebook. I was ready to just show up at their house on a Saturday and go through it again. And I'll tell you why not. Because I'm in the pocket of big business or corporation or the NHL.\nSpeaker 5: It's because I believe in this. And this, I believe, is the best thing for the city of Seattle, whoever you cheer for. But more importantly, what I am really proud of are the seven objectives that we hammered out that is in the menu, that it's a world class arena at little or no cost to the taxpayers, and\nSpeaker 5: it embodies all the values of Seattle. So with that, I hope today that the MQ passes. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Well done, Casper. And worse. I had to cancel our.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you to Councilmember Warrens for making note of the commitments in this agreement related to Labor. I wanted to just give a little bit of specific detail about those commitments. Not only are we going to ensure that the worker retention rates of of workers at the key arena now are observed, but that we are also\nSpeaker 1: going to see inclusive proposals for labor peace agreements. But also really importantly is the adherence of this project to priority hire. Last year the mayor issued an executive order saying that we should seek to ensure that public private partnerships also adhere to priority hire.\nSpeaker 1: That is not the law right now. That is something that we seek to do, but it's something that is enshrined in this particular MRU and I think that is a really good model for the city. This may be one of the biggest projects in the pipeline with the capacity to secure a career ladder, opportunities benefiting large numbers\nSpeaker 1: of Seattle workers. I also wanted to give a nod to the the arts issues that this agreement addresses. And thank you, Councilmember Suarez, for shepherding those issues, specifically ensuring that Pottery Northwest is is treated fairly in their relocation.\nSpeaker 1: I look forward in the future to seeing a definition on what relocation costs include, particularly concern about the compensation of revenue that's lost during this transition. Also very appreciative of the commitments in this agreement to work collaboratively with the arts tenants in ensuring that what is now a theater district can can also coexist peacefully and thrive with\nSpeaker 1: with these arts uses. And then finally, really appreciate how this agreement makes commitments to work with each Viera, Cerf and Kxip on the development of a future outdoor concert site.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Kathryn Herbold. I think I had Kathryn Mesquita and I think Councilmember O'Brien reaching for the mic. So it was like Councilmember O'Brien to go first or.\nSpeaker 6: I have an amendment and so I can put it out there. But if you wanted to speak before that.\nSpeaker 2: Why don't we go catch him skate and then catch from Brian Cashman, a skater. You have the floor.\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you so much. Thank you to my colleagues and I'm so excited. I jumped for the mic. I apologize for jumping in a rhythm.\nSpeaker 2: It's the.\nSpeaker 3: Rhythm.\nSpeaker 1: I just want to say a huge amount of appreciation for all of the work that went into this. Especially to Councilmember Suarez, Councilmember Bagshaw and President Harrell also for the incredible work that a Councilmember Herbal just outlined in terms of labor protections.\nSpeaker 1: I will be voting yes for this provision today. And yes. And in terms of the effort to create not just a sports arena, but a thriving arts and cultural campus for our community. This is truly, I think, a win for our community.\nSpeaker 1: I think that there's strong financial protections. I think that there are strong protections for those who are working on this project to continue to engage with our community organizations and with our neighborhood associations and to make sure that there's strong worker protections.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm incredibly honored to be able to work side by side with those in the labor community who have been working on this. Executive Secretary Nicole Grant is here along with the broader labor community who I know has been working on this to make sure that there is not just strong, good union jobs, but that there is\nSpeaker 1: labor peace agreements, that we have efforts that will hire locally and that will hire people of color and those who are in most need of jobs that are good living wage jobs and strong protections, strong union protections. I think that there's many things that the city has done to learn from your example when you work to transition\nSpeaker 1: the zoo and transition the aquarium to make sure that we had protections for the workers who were there. And I know we can learn from those experiences to make sure that we maintain good living wage jobs and that we keep workers whole in the process.\nSpeaker 1: And so when the arena reopens up and I know it's going to be an expedited timeline, thanks to the commitment from this council and of the commitment from all of you, I know that we're going to be able to have good living wage jobs while we construct and then when we're done constructing.\nSpeaker 1: And so I applaud all the parties that were involved in this process. I think that the strong financial protections and sideboards are incredible. And from my perspective, this is level setting. When you think about how arenas will be built in other cities around the country, this sets the stage for holding developers accountable, making sure that labor protections\nSpeaker 1: are included, and that the community view and the community lens is included from the beginning. So thank you for all your work on that. And there's so many things I want to say just about the tenants that are going to be there.\nSpeaker 1: I'm excited about protecting those who are involved in our arts and culture and those who are also involved in growing the next generation of our sports community. And yes, it's bringing back the Sonics. Yes, it's making sure that we can have a hockey league, but it's also making sure that those who are there right now with the\nSpeaker 1: storm and with the Washington Female Hockey Association continue to have a strong place to thrive and grow and to grow. Our next generation, I talked to the folks at the skate Like a Girl this morning, and I look forward to working with you and working with them to make sure that there is a place that's equitable and\nSpeaker 1: accessible for these young women to make sure that they have a place to play, both structured play and non structure plays. I think what we're investing in in the arena. So I'm definitely interested in hearing more about ways that we continue to improve this process.\nSpeaker 1: As you heard, this is step one, and I think that we're going to be continuing to look to make sure we're good stewards of the public dollar, that we're mitigating for impact on transit and transportation, and that we're lifting up our industries and making sure that our workers are invested in.\nSpeaker 1: And so to that end, I'm looking forward to working with you. Let's get this built. It's good for our city. It's good for jobs. It's good for a thriving Seattle. And I'm so proud of the work that you all have done.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember Skater. Okay, a little pivot on hearing from colleagues. Councilmember Swan, I believe you have some comments you'd like to make.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Brandon Harrell. I agree with Councilmember Suarez on her comments about the hard work that has been put into this legislation from central staff. And I know councilmember was specifically mentioned, goes nose down and done it. I really wanted to second that that that a lot of hard work has gone into it.\nSpeaker 4: I also agree with Councilmember Waters that she herself made her office very available to all council officers. So I think that there has been you know, in my mind, there is no there's no cause for complaint on that.\nSpeaker 4: And I do have some critical comments to make. So I just wanted to make sure that everybody understand that my critical comments reflect political differences, not in any way of failing to communicate, because I think that was done in a in in a very full manner.\nSpeaker 4: However, the political substance of legislation matters is not merely about hard work. I do intend to vote yes on this, Emmylou, because. I think that on the balance, it is better for the city than nothing. However, I also want to be clear that whether or not one thinks this is a great deal, as many for the city\nSpeaker 4: , as many have said, that's a subjective assessment. It is based on what standard you want to hold the city to. So in my view, it is a total exaggeration to say that this is the best possible deal and a great deal and so on.\nSpeaker 4: And I will explain my comments. First of all, for some reasons why I will be voting yes. I am glad that this AMAJU has managed to win the support of workers and the labor unions that represent them. As you know, the concerns raised by the dockworkers and other unions about the SODO arena were decisive in my decision\nSpeaker 4: to vote against that in the past. And the support of trade unions is an important part of my yes vote today. As a member of the labor movement myself, that is important to me. I am also glad that the city will ultimately avoid losing revenue in this milieu.\nSpeaker 4: The city has vital things to invest its limited funds on housing, addressing homelessness, equitable development and other vital services. And I really would appeal to the labor movement to show as much presence and activism as they have shown on aspects like the Arena project to also for them to show that on housing and homelessness issues, these are\nSpeaker 4: important issues. These are issues that are important for workers. These are, in my view, issues for the labor movement. So I look forward to seeing as much or more presence of labor on those issues and not just on the arena.\nSpeaker 4: Finally, I'm glad that there is the opportunity to possibly bring Seattle a men's basketball team in addition to the storm, and maybe to bring Seattle a hockey team. I know things were better with Sonics fans when we voted no against it, and at that time I said, I'm not against sports.\nSpeaker 4: I'm very pro sports. Although I would not be surprised if the NBA strings Seattle along for years and uses the prospect of moving a team to Key Arena as a threat to extract concessions from other cities. And in general, as I've said before, I think it is an outrage that professional sports league dominated by billionaires, are allowed\nSpeaker 4: to operate as legal cartels that can deny entire cities the opportunity to have a team. I also want to be clear that even though this Emmylou is better than nothing, in my view, is far from a great deal.\nSpeaker 4: The city is agreeing to give ovg a massive and that's and capital letters massive tax break for decades as business in key arena increases over the next decades, the city is agreeing to give back half of all the increased tax revenue.\nSpeaker 4: This is only half of the increase and not half of all their taxes. So again, mathematically speaking, the city will not be losing money. From the city standpoint, it will not be losing money, will not be negative. But we also need to be clear as a whole, this is a massive tax break that cities would never give\nSpeaker 4: to ordinary citizens like you and me. When was the last time you or I got that kind of tax break? And keep in mind, this is in the context of Washington having the most regressive tax system in the nation, because OPG is a very large business and has lots of money.\nSpeaker 4: This is how big business operates. They are they have the power to leverage that money, that wealth, and they are doing so. They are leveraging that money to extract from the city tax breaks. And this sort of thing happens at every level of our government.\nSpeaker 4: It is part of a system where wealth is equal to power, and that power is used to shift even more money towards the wealthy. We are seeing that same thing happening at the federal level. And by the way, the Sodo arena, NYU, you also contained massive tax break for big business.\nSpeaker 4: Imagine if governments would make deals with the regular workers, giving us back half our taxes when we get raises. This is another example of how unequal our society is. So I will be clear. I will be voting yes in favor of this, Emmylou, because it does benefit the city as a whole.\nSpeaker 4: But I will not be calling it a great deal for the city because it's not regular people. But OPG has big business that is poised to reap the huge profits.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember should. What thank you very much comes from Brian. You have the floor, sir.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. So I have an amendment that you all should have in front of you. It would amend Council Bill 119088, attachment one, Section one B under the section term and exclusivity by deleting the last sentence clause which reads and to the city, shall not provide financial support, benefits or incentives open parentheses other than those that are\nSpeaker 6: generally available to any potential developer. Close parentheses with respect to the construction of any live entertainment venue with a capacity of more than 15,000 seats within the jurisdictional jurisdictional boundaries of the city of Seattle. See if there's a second for that amendment, and then I can speak to it.\nSpeaker 2: Calling for a second chance. Memories to watch your brother hang in there. So, okay, we have a motion on the second.\nSpeaker 6: One of the principles for me when we started this conversation over a year ago was specifically around exclusivity and open to the idea of an agreement with OPG or anybody else that wanted to contribute to an arena remodel.\nSpeaker 6: But it was important to me that we not give them an exclusive deal. This section, at least my read of it, talks about, has about exclusivity, has two parts. The first says that the city shall not negotiate with any person or entity other than ovg, or it's designing or permitted signing regarding renovation or redevelopment of the arena\nSpeaker 6: , or solicit or entertain bids or proposals to do so. Now that makes sense to me as we're working on an agreement for that arena, that they would be the only ones that would do the work in the arena.\nSpeaker 6: But to extend that exclusivity for not just the term of the menu, but also the term of the entire lease agreement, that we wouldn't make any deals with anyone else in the city for arenas. Over 15,000 seats, I think ties our hands in a way and becomes problematic for me.\nSpeaker 6: One example is certainly the obvious one, which is around the SODO arena. And what kind of deals would we enter into there? What concerns me more is the reality that we're facing with this agreement in regards to a potential monopoly of large music venues by Live Nation in our market.\nSpeaker 6: I've heard a lot from folks in the music industry that have concerns about the monopoly of the music industry by a couple of players in in our city, Live Nation. If this goes forward, we control the arena and we control White River Amphitheater, which is a venue that I think seats about 16,000.\nSpeaker 6: And the music venue at the Gorge, which seats about 27,000, holds about 27,000 folks. The major music venues in town will be controlled by one and one entity. And I think that is a big problem, big problem for the citizens of Seattle, and I think a big problem for folks, especially in the music industry, to have to\nSpeaker 6: go through the single player. Now, there's no proposal to build major another major music venue in Seattle right now. And I want to be clear that if someone came up with a proposal to do something else for music or other entertainment that the tax credits we're giving away, I wouldn't want to give away lately, but I would\nSpeaker 6: want to retain the flexibility to enter into agreements like this. If someone over the course of the next 44 years decides that they wanted to do so, make an investment like this, I guess I'll leave it at that and see if there are any questions or comments on the.\nSpeaker 2: Very good, I'm sure to generate a few comments. Thank you, Councilmember Brian, for stating it very clearly. Councilmember, where is it you want to respond?\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien, for your comments. I do have five points I want to make about the exclusivity clause, starting with the fact that as a lawyer for 31 years, building casinos and hotels and hospitals and police stations and golf courses, this is a common term.\nSpeaker 5: It's a common agreement. It's a common restriction. It doesn't tie our hands. It actually protects us. On November 16th, 18 days ago, this exact amendment was in front of us and this committee unanimously denied it. Indeed, they we voted five zero that we would not change it with the same comments and concerns in exchange.\nSpeaker 5: And I bring it up now. Today, nothing has changed. And we have the exact same amendment in front of us. This amendment, the exclusivity term, I'm sorry, has no impact on any street vacation or the Soto Street vacation.\nSpeaker 5: This does not bar any group from seeking a street vacation. Like I said, this provision protects us and I guess the common sense responses. Why would we not have one? Why would we allow another arena or venue to be built that would compete against us?\nSpeaker 5: We are if we sign and go forward with this milieu with with ovg, it isn't them versus us. If Ovg makes money, we make money. At the end of the day, it isn't $650 million that Ovg is putting into this project.\nSpeaker 5: It comes out to 1.2 billion. So again, I'm hoping and I. Customer Brian, thank you for talking with me this morning. It isn't just that I've been working on this for 13 months. I did this for a living for many years.\nSpeaker 5: And so I just want to reiterate that at some point as chair of this committee, that I would be given some deference, some understanding that I know what I'm talking about, and I would not have agreed to it if I didn't believe it is a it's an important and it's a critical component in an MCU to have\nSpeaker 5: an exclusivity clause. It's like when you put in an. Non-compete clause or non-disclosure agreement. It isn't there to take away or tie the hands of any type of sports or economic development. It merely says that not only are we obviously protecting their interests, but they're protecting our financial interest as well.\nSpeaker 5: Remember, if a business comes in and puts $1.3 billion into a project, they expect to make that money back, as well as making sure that we have a revenue stream. And we also come out in the in the in the black on this.\nSpeaker 5: So with that, I will leave it at that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember Bagshaw.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilmember O'Brien, I'm not going to support this for three reasons. And the first of which is that we had this in front of us just two weeks ago and we voted it down. And I haven't talked with you about this.\nSpeaker 4: Haven't seen any reason why we would reconsider it. The second reason is I'm not clear why you would want to eliminate this clause, because what you would effectively do is to allow special financial support and benefits to go to another private developer.\nSpeaker 4: I'm not sure what you have in mind there, but it's certainly not something I want to support. And lastly, just procedurally, and I know this is something that we have brought up. We have repeatedly asked if there is an amendment, would you tell us beforehand?\nSpeaker 4: I went to office last week and I asked everybody, is there a concern? Do you have anything that you want to bring up? We heard nothing from you until 1138 this morning. And I just have to say that we are trying to bring some discipline and frankly, some cordiality among our colleagues.\nSpeaker 4: And I just don't think that's right. And I'm not going to support this amendment.\nSpeaker 2: Before a council member responds. They seem reaching for the mic. In fairness, accounts from Brian, at least in my conversations with him, he has during a very complex budget time, he made it very clear that he was under-resourced and he was struggling with having a good, strong, comprehensive understanding of this.\nSpeaker 2: And we've had many conversations. And again, in fairness to Councilmember Brian, he did comply with the time deadlines to get this within 2 hours of the deadline in order to get it on the docket. I'm not supporting the amendment as well for different reasons.\nSpeaker 2: Perhaps not that I have disagreed with the criticisms that I've heard. But my concern is, number one, I actually appreciate him bringing the issue up that if we are either consciously or unconsciously creating a monopoly for a company like Live Nation in the entertainment venue, that that's always monopolies do not work.\nSpeaker 2: That is a restraint of trade. And there's all kinds of issues that come along with that. The language in the existing exhibit that I am comfortable with says that we would give financial support, benefits or incentives. It says.\nSpeaker 2: Other than those that are generally available to any potential developer. So in other words, we will deal with developers as we deal with developers and negotiate with them on what it takes to negotiate an arrangement. But make no mistake about this, that we are dealing with a private entity.\nSpeaker 2: They have a rate of return that they are trying to achieve. We have a rate of return we are trying to achieve. And I thought they were they are well within their rights to ask for this kind of exclusivity language, which I understand from the experts that we've hired, that this is nothing to be alarmed about.\nSpeaker 2: In fact, this is sort of I don't say standard language, but this is not something that should hurt us in the long run. But I think his policy points are actually the least well-received by me that we need to concern ourselves with whether we are creating some kind of monopoly and whether that is good policy.\nSpeaker 2: So my bottom line is I'm still comfortable with the language, and I think that this does not prohibit us from talking to developers, from talking to the Soto group and having discussions as they arise. But but this is actually solid language.\nSpeaker 2: Councilmember O'Brien, you you have the I know you have a response you'd like to make. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's let's go to Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Brown.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I'm really sympathetic with the motivation for this amendment. I myself had developed amendment last week, and that gets to some of the issues here. I took a different approach than Councilmember O'Brien took and maintained the exclusivity clause and upped the capacity, because I don't actually see this as this let this language itself creating a monopoly\nSpeaker 1: except for venues that are of a certain size. And so I was interested in increasing the number of seats to 20,000 seat venues. But I was told I couldn't bring that amendment forward. And I had intended, if I could bring it forward, I intended to make sure that we checked with Ovg to see whether or not that\nSpeaker 1: was an amendment that was amenable. Because I'm sensitive to the fact that there are negotiations that have been going on as we have been making changes here on this council. And I wouldn't want to make a change that was was basically non-negotiable.\nSpeaker 1: And that's that's right where I am right now with this particular amendment as as drafted. I don't know how it would be received by our partner. And that that concerns me. I again, I don't think that the exclusivity clause as it is drafted actually does create a a monopoly for 1a1 set of interests.\nSpeaker 1: I think it does allow for a development of another facility, another large facility. But I do have questions of whether or not it is the size facility that our music community is seeking. So that that's sort of where my question is simply striking out the clause altogether.\nSpeaker 1: I just I have concerns about the impact on on the agreement with our partner on this by by doing so. If I had more information, I might feel differently.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Herbert. Councilmember O'Brien, would you like to make any comments or any customers want as a comment? I would select.\nSpeaker 6: One. I do wrap up because I can address some of the concerns. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: If you're going to wrap up, so cuts from what you like some comments. This is on the amendment, I take it? Yeah. Thank you. We have a live amendment that's been moved in second.\nSpeaker 4: So first I want to be clear. I mean, as a socialist, I'm totally opposed to using public money to subsidize private arenas or big business in general. That goes without saying. However, I think we should also be very clear that Oleg's motivation in seeking this exclusivity clause is not in any way common with me as a socialist\nSpeaker 4: . They are asking for this exclusivity clause because they want a guarantee of a monopoly on this sort of space as a business for sporting and for arena sized concerts. I am against subsidizing big business. But. But I'm also against giving a contract to any one big business that gives them the power over what sort of contract a\nSpeaker 4: city can do in the future for the next 55 years. For example, over the past few years, the city has lost a lot of revenue opportunities because it gave empty exclusive rights to all alcohol sales in all of Seattle center for decades.\nSpeaker 4: OPG is, of course, well within their legal rights to ask for this clause. The city is well within its rights to refuse this clause. And I think we also have to point out there is an insidious component to all of this, which is the false equivalency between big business and whose interests the city should be representing.\nSpeaker 4: It's like saying, Well, OPG is one entity, the city is one entity. There all is that all an equal playing field? It's merely a business negotiation that is extremely misleading. This is a city, a country and a world that is deeply unequal.\nSpeaker 4: And in my view, the city of Seattle should be hugely prioritizing the interests of regular people, not big business. This is not an equal playing field in any way. This is reminiscent to me of the letter that most of this council and many other elected officials wrote to Amazon, apologizing to them that maybe they felt unwelcome.\nSpeaker 4: I think we have to be very clear which side we should be on. It is not a new, politically neutral territory. I will be voting yes on this amendment because I do not support giving OPG a veto on the city's future decisions for the next half century.\nSpeaker 4: And, you know, the city should have the right and it should be principled enough to say that public money will not be used to subsidize big business. But we don't need already to do that and already. So it only should not have any power over the city's decisions.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember Swann, I believe Councilman Brown is going to wrap up on the amendment.\nSpeaker 6: So I may try to touch on a couple of the concerns my colleagues raised. I'll go in chronological order, as I recall. Councilmember Juarez, I appreciate you highlighting the history here and highlighting specifically the concern that the city would not want to do anything that would undermine itself going forward.\nSpeaker 6: And I agree that any agreement to partner with a new arena proposal anywhere else in the city would be one we want to take lightly. We would want to consider the impacts on our existing investment at Key Arena, but I do think we would want to have the flexibility to make the decision at that time about what's\nSpeaker 6: in the best interest of the city of Seattle. And I worry that this exclusivity clause would tie our hands and not allow us that ability if an opportunity came forward at some point in the next, you know, 40 plus years.\nSpeaker 6: Customer base, I apologize for not meeting your timeline. I do always try to be as upfront with folks on this. Unfortunately, because of the commitment I had made almost a year ago, I was unable to be at the committee meeting.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, it was scheduled after I had made that commitment on November 16th. I was under the impression that there was going to possibly be another committee meeting on November 27th, which I was able to attend. But that meeting got canceled.\nSpeaker 6: And so my only opportunity to bring an amendment forward where I could actually speak to it myself and make my case was today. And so, so here I am. I can kind of see where the votes are. So I recognize what's going to happen there.\nSpeaker 6: I also, Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate your different approach. I do firmly believe that this isn't the type of agreement where we go to the other party and ask if it's okay. I think we have a bottom line to and we can say no, this is a non-negotiable thing for us, which for me, this one is which is\nSpeaker 6: why I want to put this language in now. And if OPG says, well, we cannot proceed at this point with that and it's a deal breaker, then you know, we can have that conversation. But I don't think I need to ask their permission for changes that I think here in the best interests of Seattle.\nSpeaker 6: Finally, Council President Harrell, I really appreciate your comments there. And when I do read this language, it's it's vague and I'll speak to that and. I think there's it could mean different things to different people, but I'll speak to that after we take the vote on the amendment and talk about the final bill.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, very good. So we have an amendment that is basically stated by Council, Brian, to delete the term and exclusivity language at the end. I think we all got a grasp on that. So I'm just going to ask for a not only a voice vote, but raise your hand as well.\nSpeaker 2: So it's been moved. And Second Councilmember O'Brien's amendment's been moved. And second and all those in favor of his amendment, please vote yes and raise your hand.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, yes.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. All of the polls say no and raise your hand. Oh, no.\nSpeaker 3: No.\nSpeaker 2: So the amendment fails. So so now we have the still is an amended legislation because Councilmember Juarez had made a substitution. So we're we now have the Bass legislation. So we will I don't need a motion for this.\nSpeaker 2: I could just do a roll call when it's time to to vote. Yeah, we'll move it in a minute. So, you know, I want to make sure everyone has said what they want to say before we vote. So.\nSpeaker 2: Council Member Yes, we're on the Bass. Council Member Back.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I'm very optimistic today that we are making way to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in an asset that is one of the most prominent assets we have in our city and certainly historically relevant. And I know we've heard some comments about what the city is giving up.\nSpeaker 4: We're also getting $600 million that is invested in an asset that needs some love. And let's just be frank and I do want to acknowledge the work. I mean, Mercedes in the background has been the understated person and Kushner aerostat Ben Noble in the back.\nSpeaker 4: But Councilmember Suarez you have done an amazing job of bringing us through this and with Council President Harrell, this has been no small feat and we have been working on lots of things through the budget. But you laid out a plan.\nSpeaker 4: You worked on the RFP. We got proposals. You helped identify the pros and cons of all of those. We worked through the summer. You worked all the way through the fall on this. I do not want to understate how important it is.\nSpeaker 4: And that said, we've acknowledged Brian Surratt, who's still hiding in the back. Robert Nelms, I don't know if Robert is here. Thank you. That's Master Robert's Robert Nelms, but also our friends from uptown. I see that Debbie Fastow is back there and Cooper was here earlier.\nSpeaker 4: I know that. Mike McQuade, thank you so much. On our Belltown friends, it has mattered so much to have you all here in the port. Stephanie Bowman, thank you. You are a star. Lindsay Wolpert, thank you for putting your positions out there and for also saying that you're going to assist with the transportation, whether it's $5 million\nSpeaker 4: to help the mobility plan or help us with the monorail, it is going to be a big difference. I also want to acknowledge what the city is getting besides having $600 million that's going to be invested in our neighborhoods and the arena.\nSpeaker 4: There's going to be $40 million coming in as a transportation payment. We know that the city will match that and more over the next number of months and years. The baseline rent we have acknowledged. But I really want to say thank you to Tim, Luigi and to Francesca you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And Lance Lopes, thank you for reaching out to our community. It's made such a huge difference because I know that coming in from Los Angeles or New York City, somebody would say, Well, you don't know Seattle well.\nSpeaker 4: You have worked hard to get to know us, and I'm really respectful of that. And I just want you to know how much I appreciate the work that you've done, and particularly around youth care, our friends from Youth Care, you make such a difference in our community and having some of not only those of you who are\nSpeaker 4: working at youth care, but some of your students who have been here, it's going to make a big difference. And we all are focusing on how our community can be a better place to live. And I think this is going to really help us.\nSpeaker 4: The value to Seattle Center is huge. The work that you're going to be doing, not just in the arena, but helping us with bringing together the tenants in Seattle Center, whether it's Pottery Northwest people have talked about that skate like a girl the storm.\nSpeaker 4: I'm sorry that our storm friends left because sometimes we hear people say, oh, we need to have a world class basketball team, or we got one, and we may very well have another. And one thing I haven't heard said is, do you all realize that this year is the 100th anniversary?\nSpeaker 4: This is the 100 year anniversary of the Seattle metropolitans who won the Stanley Cup. So I just want to say thank you. Thank you to those of you from from our good friends, from the hockey teams, because you've been here meeting after meeting.\nSpeaker 4: And it's been great to see you, not just our friends from the Sonics, but to have our friends from hockey as well. And I want to acknowledge this the sense of the Seattle integration, our school district, many of you know, just a week ago we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Seattle Public Schools doing work not\nSpeaker 4: just on the memorial. And potentially another school asset there. And it makes such a difference to be bringing the community around what we can do. The Mobility Action Plan, Debbie FRAUSTO is here and I can see her smiling and sort of that Jiminy Cricket on my shoulder for the last year is that we have to have a\nSpeaker 4: mobility action plan that moves people to and from Seattle Center that doesn't compromise how people get around in uptown Belltown and South Lake Union. So I just want to acknowledge her and Alan Hart via architects are going to be helping us with that and already mentioned has been the equity for workers.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Herbold I know that this has been something so important to you and of course our new Councilmember Mosqueda having labor harmony. The priority hires the apprenticeship programs. This is going to revolutionize how our people are working and both during the time we're constructing and afterwards when we actually have them on site.\nSpeaker 4: And I think the business and economic development in the neighborhood is going to be tremendously impactful. Nicole Grant, are you still here or did she leave? So from. Nicole Grant. Marty Anderson Dale Bridle spoke ILWU. Thank you for being here.\nSpeaker 4: Also Andrea and Bess from Stagehands. Thank you. I think some of you have already gone, but really appreciate the work that you've done and being here and talking to us about how important this project is to you. So I'm all for this in huge contrast to 18 months ago when there was a lot of sadness in this\nSpeaker 4: room. I think we're going to see a great deal of support here up on the dais, but also a great support going forward. So many thanks to all of you who have come.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilmember Bagshaw. Okay, I see Councilmember Johnson, the tallest one up here, getting ready to say a few words. So, Senator Johnson, you have the floor, sir, just briefly.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Council President Harrell. You know, when we started on this process, I think one of the things that I really tried to watch out for is the danger of what happens sometimes in public private partnerships. And when they go bad is when the public sector has to take on all the risk and the private sector gets\nSpeaker 7: to pocket all the profits. And that is not what we have here. This is a true partnership where we are sharing in the risk, but also sharing the reward. I'd like to thank Councilmember Suarez and Brian Serrano and many folks here at the city who made this possible.\nSpeaker 7: I'd also like to thank the folks at Oak View for really working hard to be good neighbors and good partners with us. Much has been made of the work around labor harmony and protections for workers, but also the work that we did to make sure that the intentionality of the Seattle Center as an arts and cultural district\nSpeaker 7: is preserved as part of the growth and redevelopment of ARENA. You know that the OPG group continues to commit to the mandatory housing affordability payments, that they will commit to that $10 million of funding for youth care, as well as an additional $10 million in funding and the $40 million transportation funds.\nSpeaker 7: These are all really important commitments, I think, about being a good neighbor and understanding the impact that you have on your community. We've set very high expectations for this project and we expect it to deliver. But this is just one of the many opportunities that the council has for reviewing the work.\nSpeaker 7: You know, I've asked questions in previous committees and will continue to ask questions about issues like the historic preservation tax credit, which is currently 10% of the argues financial plans as we get into implementation documents. If that tax credit is removed, as it is contemplated right now by the folks in Congress, I'll be looking to our private\nSpeaker 7: sector partners to how they're going to fill that gap as we get into the environmental impact statements and we talk about what the, you know, Sunday after Thanksgiving, really big transportation impact day of the potential of a basketball hockey game, along with the work of the ballet for a matinee and an evening performance, as well as Black\nSpeaker 7: Nativity and all the other things that happen on Seattle Center on that first Sunday of Thanksgiving. You know, what does that really mean for our transportation mitigation plan and how do we analyze those things through an environmental impact statement?\nSpeaker 7: Those are going to be important elements as we move forward. And the implementation documents that I'll be watching for. And Councilmember wise, you alluded to my little bobblehead. So after the last vote, you know, I will confess at six foot three of being one of the shorter of my cousins.\nSpeaker 7: And my little brother played basketball at the University of Washington for a couple of years. And I've had a cousin who played overseas. And when I got to see him and his friends and my cousins, I hear more about the Sonics and hockey than I do just about anything else.\nSpeaker 7: And I had a good friend. Give me that bobblehead after the last vote and said, Don't lose the faith. Keep up the work and make sure that you stay committed to bringing professional hockey and professional basketball to the city of Seattle.\nSpeaker 7: And I'm proud to be here today and taking this vote. And I hope that it is just another step for us in bringing those professional teams back to the city. Councilmember wise, the kids wouldn't let me bring my storm swag with me today.\nSpeaker 7: That's how important it is to them. So I don't have my little sort of supporting dolls that I hope that I would have. But Hannah was having too much fun playing with that on the bus this morning, and I couldn't part with that four year old's commitment to her storm dolls.\nSpeaker 7: So thank you, everybody, for being here today. Thanks to all the hard work for the city staff. Looking forward to voting yes.\nSpeaker 2: Very good. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. If I don't see any more folks grabbing the mic, I'm going to ask Councilmember Councilmember Brand, you want to say a closing word, please?\nSpeaker 6: I if I had the choice, my preference today would be to abstain from voting for this. I believe that there's been a lot of hard work put into this. But when the city is going to invest potentially 614 million in tax revenues, it will forgo and give to the Ovg group to do this work.\nSpeaker 6: I think it's critically important that we make sure that we're doing this right. And I am not convinced in looking at them or view that we're quite there yet. One little example is the amendment that I proposed earlier.\nSpeaker 6: There's a parenthetical in there that says we can't provide financial support other than those that are generally available to any potential developer that is fairly high level language. In a memo you and I understand its purpose as a placeholder, it's not clear to me that if providing if providing $600 million of tax benefits to another project would\nSpeaker 6: be considered, what we generally want are generally available, or if that would be an exception, that would be prohibited by this. And the distinction between where we are today as an emotive issue and where we'll all 20 billion a number of months for signing transaction documents I expect to get to a level of specificity will be clearer\nSpeaker 6: what we're actually signing on to at that point. As I mentioned, my preference would be to abstain today and wait to see what those transaction documents look like. But our council rules prohibit abstentions on the full council, and so I have to choose to vote yes or no.\nSpeaker 6: And so I will be voting no on this. But I want to let the folks know that are continue to negotiate this, that I hope to be in a place when the transaction documents are ready, that I feel confident in voting yes on those documents when they're here.\nSpeaker 2: Baroness. Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilmember Wurst. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: I'll wrap it up. Before I make the motion, I want to just say a few comments. Since we took a vote in May of 2016, it's been a long road, particularly for my female colleagues. The irony here today is that the women, not just the women, all the men in my colleagues, put in the hard work to\nSpeaker 5: get this done. The end of the day, I didn't get a bobblehead. I got called names and a bunch of awful other things. And I think some people thought, well, because that happened, that somehow some of us would be punitive and vindictive.\nSpeaker 5: But in fact, you know that saying if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen, that just made us more emboldened to do the right thing and do our homework and show up and read everything and make sure everybody had everything in front of them with the whole time.\nSpeaker 5: US Our rally was Councilmember Bagshaw. Councilmember Gonzales. Councilmember Humboldt was to make sure that our colleagues had all the information that we wanted to have a partnership we wanted to, but also understanding the clear lines between the executive and the legislative branch that we would work with the executive branch.\nSpeaker 5: I never started this job with an us or them attitude that the executive is somehow on the seventh floor doing something evil and they're going to send something downstairs that's bad and my job is to take it apart.\nSpeaker 5: That's not how I do business. So with that, I think I'm going to I'll leave it at that and I'll go ahead, make a motion, please. Do I move that council? I'm sorry, I move that council pass council bill 119088 as amended.\nSpeaker 2: And second, please call a role on the passage of the amended bill.\nSpeaker 5: O'Brien.\nSpeaker 3: No salon. I.\nSpeaker 5: BAGSHAW High. Johnson. Whereas I herbold ii mosquera i. President Harrell I seven in favor one opposed.\nSpeaker 2: Excellent. The bill passes and the chair will sign it. And thank all of you for your rich comments and discussion. Is there any further business coming for the Council?\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Swan Thank you, President. I move to be excused from the full council meeting on December 11, 2017.\nSpeaker 2: And secondly, the customers want to be excused from the Council on December 11, 2017. All those in favor say I, I oppose. The ayes have it. Any further business going for the council? If not, we stand adjourned and everyone have a great day.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: 13 Eyes Council Bill 550 has passed. We're on the homestretch here, folks. Next, public hearing is 20 dash 05776. And it's a bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 1901 South Clarkson Street in Platte Park. Councilman CdeBaca, will you please put Council Bill 576 on the floor for passage?\nSpeaker 5: I move that council bill 576 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.\nSpeaker 0: It's been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 20 20576 is open now. We have the staff report, please.\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead, Libby.\nSpeaker 5: All right. I am the other Libby with community planning and development. And hopefully, can you all see my screen? Mm hmm. Okay, great. So this is 1901 South Clarkson Street. This is located in Council District seven. In the Plat Park neighborhood.\nSpeaker 5: And the applicant is requesting to rezone from urban single unit C one with a minimum zone lot size of 5500 square feet to urban single unit B one, which has a minimum zone lot size of 4500 square feet.\nSpeaker 5: The site's approximately 4690 square feet. And it's located at the intersection of Jewel Avenue and Clarkson Street, a block north of Evans Avenue. And as I just stated, the current zoning is urban single unit C one. This does allow for the accessory dwelling unit use and the detached accessory dwelling unit building form, but it only allows the\nSpeaker 5: building form on a minimum zone lot size of 5500 square feet. And so as you can see, there's other you zoned district along Clarkson Street. And then as U.S., you see as you move farther east and then you SUV one to the north and the west of the site.\nSpeaker 5: The existing land use is a single unit home. Most of this area is single unit uses with multiple. There's several duplexes scattered throughout. And then as you can see, there's more commercial an office along the commercial corridor of South Pearl Street.\nSpeaker 5: The bottom right hand side is the existing home, but above it is another existing single unit home in the area across Jewel. And then there's the existing and existing duplex approx across Clarkson Street and then kind of the start of the commercial corridor on South Pearl with the restaurant.\nSpeaker 5: This application was complete at the beginning of April. An informational notice was sent to neighboring property owners within 200 feet of the site on April 3rd. It went to planning board on June 3rd, where it was recommended unanimously for approval.\nSpeaker 5: We have received several public comments. We received a comment from the Platt Park People's Association, as well as five neighboring property owners, all in opposition of the proposal. The Park Peoples Association said they are supportive of accessory dwelling units in the neighborhood, but they were concerned that this particular rezoning would lead to spot rezoning.\nSpeaker 5: And then out of the five emails that we received, several of them were concerned that this would actually make the neighborhood less affordable and as well as concerned with parking issues that this could cause. And then two of the comments were concerned that this could lead to commercial uses, such as a medical office on the site.\nSpeaker 5: But this would not open up the site for commercial uses. There are five review criteria that must be met in order for it to be approved. And I'll go through each of each one. The first is consistency with adopted plans, of which there are two.\nSpeaker 5: In Comprehensive Plan 2040. There are several strategies that this proposed rezoning meets. I'll just go over a couple of them. The first is it will create a greater mix of housing options in every neighborhood for all individuals and families, which will lead to a more equitable, affordable and inclusive Denver.\nSpeaker 5: And it will also promote an environmentally resilient Denver by promoting infill development. And we're infrastructure and services are already in place. Now moving to blueprint the guidance for this area is the urban neighborhood context, which is a single and two unit residential areas with some multi-unit and mixed use embedded throughout the block.\nSpeaker 5: Patterns are regular and there's alley access and then a high degree of walkability. The future place type for this site is low residential, which is predominantly single and two unit uses and accessory dwelling units are appropriate. The future street type for both Dual Avenue and Clarkson Street are local, which are mostly characterized by residential uses.\nSpeaker 5: Blueprint also goes into further detail on when it's appropriate for rezoning to go from to request a smaller lot size. And so it says that it's only appropriate when there's an established pattern of surrounding blocks of smaller lots with similar uses that would that would be consistent with the zone district request.\nSpeaker 5: So this map that's on the screen shows the sizes for the lots and the surrounding blocks. So you can see the lot. The subject site has the the red box around it, and the block that it's on is about split between lots that are under 5500 square feet, which would be more consistent with the US sub one\nSpeaker 5: zone district and lots that are greater than 5500 square feet, which would be more consistent with us. You see one once you cross Clarkson Street to the east side and then move further east, you can see if there's a pattern of the yellow and the kind of purple lots.\nSpeaker 5: And so that really does those are the larger lots that are more consistent with us, you see and see one. But when you go north, northwest and west of the site, you can see that there's a lot more of the teal color which is more consistent with the US.\nSpeaker 5: You be one zone district size. So based on this, staff found that there is an established pattern of smaller lots. But because there needs to be both an established pattern of smaller lots with similar uses, the applicant provided this second map.\nSpeaker 5: So this is they went through and found where all the accessory dwelling units are in the area. So the subject side, it has the yellow star and then you can see where all the black stars are, are where they found accessory dwelling units and most of them are on properties that are zoned sub one, but you have\nSpeaker 5: the smaller class sizes. So Steph did find that it meets this a you know, it is appropriate to reason or it meets this guidance and blueprint for when it's appropriate to rezone to a district with a smaller lot size.\nSpeaker 5: And then the growth area strategy is all other areas of the city, which is where we anticipate 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040. Staff also finds it meets the next two criteria and that it will result in uniformity of district regulations and it will further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through\nSpeaker 5: implementing city adapted plans. The newly adopted guidance and blueprint on when it's appropriate to rezone to a district with a smaller lot size serves as the justifying circumstance for this application. And finally, staff finds that this proposal is consistent with the urban neighborhood context, the residential zone district purpose and the US hub.\nSpeaker 5: One intent statement. So therefore staff finds that it meets all five criteria and we recommend approval of this rezoning. And that concludes staff presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions and the applicant is available as well.\nSpeaker 0: Wonderful. Thank you. Libby, if we could ask you to take down your screen. Sharing wonderful. Tonight, counsel has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 20-057. We have one individual who has signed up to speak this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Barbara Poole. We've got her in the queue. And so we'll. Get her unmuted. All right. Go ahead, please, Barbara.\nSpeaker 5: Hello. Good evening. And thank you for allowing me to state my opinion. I live next door to 1901, so. Clarkson I'm a 1905 self Clarkson Street.\nSpeaker 4: And the I've been hesitant.\nSpeaker 5: Until now to oppose the Farthing moving forward with their request to rezone. However, there has been a new development and that they.\nSpeaker 0: Have moved to.\nSpeaker 5: Steamboat Springs Springs.\nSpeaker 0: Potentially.\nSpeaker 5: For a year, but currently they have moved away and they have three renters in their house currently. So. This turn of events means they are now proposing.\nSpeaker 0: To potential.\nSpeaker 4: Rental.\nSpeaker 5: Properties on their undersized lot. I do realize that Denver has been made aware that Denver has regulations that property owners need to be present to rent, that they can't.\nSpeaker 4: Rent.\nSpeaker 5: Both units. However, a quick Google search showed that there are workarounds and plenty of people know how to work around that. So that does leave the potential.\nSpeaker 4: And I'm not.\nSpeaker 5: Suggesting this is the father's immediate goal, but.\nSpeaker 0: It is a potential.\nSpeaker 5: For my close neighbors to the north. The. The ADA will essentially remove any privacy I enjoy in my backyard.\nSpeaker 0: The.\nSpeaker 5: The due to the height of the structure will look directly into my yard and then overlook.\nSpeaker 0: My.\nSpeaker 5: Fence. Our shared property line is only about 12 inches north of my home. So. This is concerning to me just because I have a young daughter that is in the yard frequently they have where they would be able to look into the back of the windows in the back of my house, the the yard in the back\nSpeaker 5: . And just.\nSpeaker 0: Essentially our.\nSpeaker 5: Privacy.\nSpeaker 0: Will be gone.\nSpeaker 5: And so I also believe that this would really decrease potentially really not.\nSpeaker 4: Significant.\nSpeaker 5: Whatever decrease my property value as well to have no privacy in the backyard.\nSpeaker 4: So and the dense dwelling.\nSpeaker 5: So for that reason, I oppose the rezoning. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Miss Paul. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council. Councilwoman Sandoval.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Madam President, for the. I have a question for the Mrs. for right now. Do you. What's your zoning? Is your zoning as a rule, it's the same.\nSpeaker 4: As the farthing.\nSpeaker 5: So it's it doesn't allow accessory dwelling units or is it.\nSpeaker 0: I don't have the lot.\nSpeaker 5: So is not large enough. Okay. So you're in the same kind of situation where you have connect. Whose baby is this? What is the situation where she has see one but the lot size is too small so she wouldn't be able to have an accessory dwelling unit.\nSpeaker 5: Is that what I'm understanding? So I haven't looked at her lot size, but. So you can still have an accessory dwelling unit if you're under the minimum lot size, but you would have to be attached. So it's just prevents the detached accessory dwelling unit.\nSpeaker 5: If it's not 5500 square feet in the US, you see one district. But you can have it in the basement. Correct. Okay. Thank you. That clarifies my question. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Sawyer.\nSpeaker 5: Thanks, Madam President. I think that clarifies my question, too. I was trying to figure out I guess I still need a little more clarification, Libby. The form based zoning code. This is the part that to me is like speaking Greek because.\nSpeaker 5: I guess I need a little more clarification around the purpose of rezoning from the sea to the sea. Yeah. That have to do with the lot size and the requirement that it be attached versus the unattached 80 you.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So I believe I mean the applicant is here, but I believe he would like to do a detached accessory dwelling unit and that you have to have the minimum lot size. But you then attached you don't. Okay.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I was. So it's got to do. Can I is that is it okay if I ask just one more question, Madam President. So, Mr. Farthing, maybe could you explain or clarify is that is that your intention then to do the detached one and that's why you're rezoning?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Can everybody hear me?\nSpeaker 5: Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: All right. I got awesome. First foremost, thank you guys for giving me the opportunity and consideration for this rezoning. But that to answer your question, yes, that would be our intent was to be a detached accessory dwelling unit, just like all the other ones that are in the neighborhood.\nSpeaker 5: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. No further questions.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Clark.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. A couple of questions, Libby. I looked through the staff report, and I saw the letter, which was very short from EPA. They didn't say that they oppose it. They said that they're not able to support it.\nSpeaker 2: Maybe I'm thinking more with the marijuana social consumption where there's, you know, support non opposition and oppose. Do we just treat anything that is not support as opposition or because it didn't say we oppose this, it says we are unable to support it.\nSpeaker 2: So talk me through. There's something that I'm missing there. Or is that just how we treat anything other than support?\nSpeaker 5: No, that's a great question. That was my assumption, which could have been incorrect because yeah, you're right. They said they chose not to support. So I assumed that meant that they opposed. But you're right, I don't know how I can ask as that's a question I can bring up to our reasoning team.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. I just read a lot like a letter of non opposition versus a one and I didn't know if we had that distinction when it came to zoning. You had mentioned this, but just to quickly clarify and get on the record, there were two of the comments against that reference, some sort of business operation, a dental, medical\nSpeaker 2: that is not allowed under any of these conditions attached any of that? Correct.\nSpeaker 5: Correct.\nSpeaker 2: And then there is also in the staff report, there is, you know, a couple of pages, I think starting around page 46 that show a map and then people are in support. And your staff report, you only said we received the you know, the letter from three V.A. is letters in opposition to we don't count that kind\nSpeaker 2: of stuff. Those are just other things. How does that get quantified? Because it's in the staff report, but it wasn't in the presentation. So just curious, but.\nSpeaker 5: Correct. Yeah. So those were from the applicants outreach. So those were not letters that staff had received. The other ones were things that we have received, but the applicant can speak. That was from his outreach to the neighboring property owners.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. I think those were the questions that I had. Thank you very much. Thank you. Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Hines.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. So I think Councilmember Clark, we are calling him that instead of President Clark. But anyway, Councilmember Clark, I was I've got similar questions. So thank you for distinguishing between the applicants letters and these letters.\nSpeaker 2: Were you saying that all of the comments that CPD received were in opposition? Is that.\nSpeaker 5: Correct?\nSpeaker 2: And how many comments was that?\nSpeaker 5: We received five. Five.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And and CPD believes this is worthy of acceptance despite the letters of opposition. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 5: Correct. Based on the criteria, we do find that it is compliant with the criteria.\nSpeaker 2: And and so I think that, you know, some of the concerns were about private property rights or the lack of privacy or. I am I am I kind of digesting the the letters that you received and opposition accurately.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So there I mean, there were concerns about parking as well as that this could make the neighborhood less affordable.\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Okay. And and so there is a rezoning in my district, which is not related to this one, about an area that I'm I'm learning a bit because so far we have never in in my you know, in my year on council president has been pretty clear.\nSpeaker 2: We have unanimously accepted every area rezoning. And so I'm trying to trying to figure out how we might break that mold. And I don't really see how how we can do that, because our president has been pretty firm and pretty unanimous for all of them.\nSpeaker 2: And so I. I guess. There is also a concern about private property rights. Like, as in, if someone build something that goes above my fence, then that impedes my property rights. But doesn't it? I mean, I guess I could also it's that isn't relevant for the five criteria because that's both plots that the owners of each of\nSpeaker 2: those plots have private property rights. And and so how would we necessarily correlate that? Am I barking up the wrong tree or the right six foot fence or.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. I guess I did. Do you have a specific question?\nSpeaker 4: I just.\nSpeaker 2: Know. I know. I apologize. I guess I am asking a softball question that really doesn't have an easy answer. But I mean, I guess the question is this you don't see any place in the five criteria where private property rights of the current owner or the adjacent property owner meet or fit into any of those criteria.\nSpeaker 2: Is that right?\nSpeaker 5: Correct.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. And thank you, Madam President. Madam President. Guy. Sorry. Go ahead. I just wanted to, I guess, reiterate the fact that, you know, I know there is some opposition, but we I have done my family. I've done all kinds all the due diligence we possibly can.\nSpeaker 2: And and we want to make sure that all of our neighbors are happy and and bring a decision together that that makes sense. Right. And I I've spoken at length with with with Barbara, our next door neighbor. Next door neighbor, as well as all the surrounding neighbors.\nSpeaker 2: And I know that we can come to if there is any opposition or any discomfort, you know, it's something that we talk about constantly and want to make sure that everybody's happy. So, you know, we really want to reiterate the fact that that, you know, we're not trying to piss off any neighbors here and really do the\nSpeaker 2: right thing. But, you know, according to the city's adopted plans, you know, everything undeniably does follow the adopted plans of the building to use. And I guess my, my, my, I guess approach would be kind of two pronged, right?\nSpeaker 2: One, the consistency of adopted plans, but then to I mean, regardless of and EDU is even to be built on this on this lot the lot is more like a U.S. would be want than it is a see one.\nSpeaker 2: So we're basically rezoning it to what it should be to begin with, which was out of my control when this thing got zoned right years and years and years ago. But, you know, at the end of the day, we really just want to be a good neighbor and and do the right thing.\nSpeaker 2: So that's.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: My little pitch.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. Mr. Farthing, as long as we have you here. Couple of questions as I'm looking again at the aerials. I noticed there's a garage that faces the side street, not the alley. Is there. Is your intention to build a detached adu in place of the garage?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. So that garages is built probably, what, 1905? It's not usable as a garage now it's a storage shed. And so that would be torn down and everything would be built to code and yeah, there would be a garage and then they do on top of it.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And because the, the zone and the size of the lot would allow an attached adu. Why are you not doing that?\nSpeaker 2: Well, simply because of the size of our lot and the alley access. We want to keep as grass as possible. And I don't know. Then we got to deal with. Okay. Can we have a curb, side to side street access from door or have access in the alley?\nSpeaker 2: So there's that option potentially. But we we we never really wanted to do that.\nSpeaker 3: But why? Because there is there already is a curb cut for the garage on Jewel.\nSpeaker 2: But but it would have to be detached because there's the curb cut on the garages, I don't know, 30 or 40 feet from where my house is. And so I don't we wouldn't want to build the house that takes up the entire lot and lose every single square footage of grass.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And are you or have you actually moved to Steamboat? Are you in Steamboat right now?\nSpeaker 2: I am in Steamboat, yes.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So are you. And what is the plan for this? Well.\nSpeaker 2: You know, the plan right now is just to be here for a year. You know, with COVID and everyone working remotely, my wife and I have been talking about moving in the mountains for since we've been together for seven years.\nSpeaker 2: Ten years. And and so we said, all right, all right, now's the time to do it. And we have an opportunity. And so, yeah, we're up here for a year just to, I guess, see if you like it.\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, regardless of of our outcome in Steamboat, we still want to be able to have the opportunity to. To build the ADA and our Denver house. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Now, you just bought this house about a year and a half ago.\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\nSpeaker 3: November. And you're thinking of selling it already?\nSpeaker 2: No, no, no. We're never going to sell our house.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, you use it around and. Pardon me. That's my clock chiming on the hour. I apologize.\nSpeaker 2: No one going to hear that. One more.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. So you're going to rent both the Adu and the house?\nSpeaker 2: No. No. So we would never, ever, ever do that. The adu. If if if we move back to Denver. Right. And if we have the money to build the Adu. Right, then it would be a a place for me to stay when we're in Denver.\nSpeaker 2: Because my wife's name is Endeavor and or option to write. We move. We don't like Steamboat and move back to Denver. And our current home kicked the renters out, though, did you? And now we have a place for Asian grandparents to stay in my home office.\nSpeaker 2: Obviously, rental, rental opportunities and all the equitable, positive positives that their native will bring.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. Libby, can I ask you a couple questions now on the the zoning that is there now, the C1. Allows them attached to you? Correct.\nSpeaker 5: Correct.\nSpeaker 3: But the lot size is too small for a detached. This is what I'm hearing, correct?\nSpeaker 5: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: And the justification for it is the the ungrammatical. I'll point out, being an old editor, it is only appropriate to allow smaller lot sizes in the existing zone district if there is an established pattern in the surrounding blocks of smaller lots with similar uses.\nSpeaker 3: So we have a map with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten black stars that indicate that there are 80 use of those locations. Are all of those detached or are any of them attached to use?\nSpeaker 2: They're they're all detached.\nSpeaker 3: They're all detached. Okay. Thank you. And, Libby, what is the is given the the footprint of the house? Are there any setbacks from the primary residence or the primary structure to the ADU that obviously on a smaller lot you might run into a problem like that?\nSpeaker 3: But do they apply in this case?\nSpeaker 5: And so there's no set back that I'm aware of from the structure. There could be building requirements, but it does need to be in the back 35% of the lot.\nSpeaker 3: So you don't know if the primary structure came close to that 35% line. Fire code would, of course, say you have to have some kind of setback. Yes. Minimum five feet, I imagine. Okay. Are there any rules about these to use in this zone district or in any zone district that say you must be the primary resident\nSpeaker 3: of the property in order to have it or do. I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 5: Oh, no, you can finish your question.\nSpeaker 3: Or. Or can you rent both the house and the you two separate parties?\nSpeaker 5: So in all single unit districts that allow ADU is this is city wide where regardless of what neighborhood context you do have to, the owner needs to live on the site.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. And are there any restrictions? I don't think there are. But confirm for me, can and Adu be used as a short term rental? Yes. And in all cases.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, it can. Okay. As long as the owner is living right.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you. That's all, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Those were somewhat along the lines of my questions that Councilman Flynn was just asking. So first, I wanted to just ask Levy, when we have applicants coming in to zone their property for an EDU, what justification do you all use to verify that they are in fact an\nSpeaker 0: owner and occupant of the property that they own?\nSpeaker 5: So for that I would have to get back to we don't I wouldn't actually review the request that would be with development services would be the ones that are residential team to actually review the zoning permit to make sure that the property owner does live on site.\nSpeaker 5: And I'm not exactly sure what they look at, but I can find that out and get back to you.\nSpeaker 0: Well, since it is one of the criteria that allows an application to move forward, it seems to me somewhere in that front end application process we should be doing some of that verification. And so I guess I just question how.\nSpeaker 0: An application is allowed to move forward if we have an applicant that does not live on the premise. This individual is the owner. But, I mean, he just admitted he's living for a whole year in a different city, and that is one of the criteria.\nSpeaker 0: So I guess I would just ask who from the city attorney office is available and I want you to weigh in on this question about how we can allow an applicant to move forward that does not live on the property, given that it is one of the clear criteria that has to be met to move forward with\nSpeaker 0: an ADU on your property. And we have Nate Lucero here. And so we'll get. So, Nate, can you help us into the.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Can you hear me now, Councilwoman? Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: Great. So is the question related to whether or not. You can have an accessory dwelling unit and not be the owner of the property.\nSpeaker 0: So two questions. The first is what do we do to verify that you are an occupied owner making the application to do an ADU? Because that is one of the criteria. Are we allowed to move forward knowing that we have an applicant that does not live on the premise?\nSpeaker 0: Admittedly.\nSpeaker 2: So I think Libby is correct in that development services would have a process to ensure that any applicant to construct an accessory dwelling unit is the occupied owner. I'm not sure what their list of. Criteria is that they go through to ensure that the that the residence is owner occupied.\nSpeaker 2: But there must be a way that they do that. So in this case. You know, with Mr. Farthing not living at the residence, he would not be able to apply to construct the ADU. So if he were to move back to the residence and make application for the construction of an 80 you, then he could move forward\nSpeaker 2: with that effort.\nSpeaker 0: But let me ask my question differently. The fact that this applicant is not an occupied owner can be used as justification to deny the application for moving forward. Correct.\nSpeaker 2: Are you talking about denying the rezoning because the owner doesn't live there?\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: It's part of the criteria that has to be met as far as them being able to move it forward. So how do we justifiably approve it when admittedly the owner is saying, I don't live there? So I'm going to be there for a whole year.\nSpeaker 0: But I'm making the application and. I may or may not live there at any time in the future. But, you know, I want to move forward with this application and I get that we have to deal with every single zoning on its own merits.\nSpeaker 0: Behind you brought up the question about, you know, this has been the practice across the city and yes, across the board. We've been talking about wanting to see more opportunities for ADAS to exist in our city because it's part of our housing solutions.\nSpeaker 0: Right. But at the same time, if we have a criteria that comes through the CPD office, it seems to me all of that should be bundled into an application that is put before us, regardless of whether it's part of this arm of that arm of CPD, it should all be, you know, the same the same process move\nSpeaker 0: forward.\nSpeaker 2: Well, so what we're doing here this evening is considering the entitlement of the property and whether or not a rezoning to the US you be one zoned district is appropriate. So we're not considering any development application in that city council this evening.\nSpeaker 2: We're only considering whether or not it would be appropriate to rezone this property to a specific district.\nSpeaker 0: We're creating that entitlement with a known property owner saying, I don't live there, and that's what I'm having struggle with in terms of the the process that we're dealing with here. Now, if he lived in the property and he was making the application, that would be completely different.\nSpeaker 0: But he's admittedly saying, I'm not going to be there for a whole year, but I'm making this application. So that's that's my struggle with it. So I'll just have to vote as I may. It sounds like there isn't any other explanation.\nSpeaker 0: For addressing my question.\nSpeaker 2: Well, can I.\nSpeaker 0: Just a moment, sir. We need the city attorney to respond. Nate. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 2: So it's really a bifurcated question, Councilman Sandoval. One is. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: That's okay.\nSpeaker 2: So. So one is the entire process, right? Like many developers that you see come before, you sometimes are just entitling the property and then they turn around and sell it to whoever is going to actually construct the project.\nSpeaker 0: If not, all of those processes have this kind of criteria attached to it. That's the difference between this and those.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And I would respectfully disagree because all rezonings have the exact same.\nSpeaker 4: Criteria that you have to.\nSpeaker 1: Consider.\nSpeaker 0: All right. I'm not going to argue with you. I just don't agree. So thank you. The photos were the extent of my questions. Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, we have Councilman Sawyer.\nSpeaker 5: Thanks, Madam President. My question is for Mrs. Poole. So you said you have 13 inches from your window of the back of your house to your property line. Is that correct? Oh, I'm sorry. You're muted. You can't unmute yourself there.\nSpeaker 5: You're in there? Yes, that's correct. How did that end with setback? We have setback requirements. So how did that happen? Back in the twenties, maybe. I don't know. When these are old homes, it's. Okay. At some point it was re zoned.\nSpeaker 5: This is it was this way when I bought the home that got it the property line. Okay. The reason I'm asking is because one of the criteria that we have to consider is health, safety and welfare of the community.\nSpeaker 5: Right? So if we are looking at a rezoning and we are looking at a situation where a potential of 82 is being built and there's if you can pass a cup of sugar from one window to the other because there were no setbacks in the twenties when the properties were built, that is weird and potentially a safety\nSpeaker 5: issue, which is why I am asking the question. So I was just trying to mind around and I've been looking on Google Maps at the, at the at your property connections and trying to figure out, you know, where the property lines are.\nSpeaker 5: So can you explain to me a little bit more what what your concern is about that? Well, I think just the I think the loss of privacy and the decreased property value, those are my biggest concerns with an EDU because right now we you know our backyard.\nSpeaker 0: It's.\nSpeaker 5: It's you know, I mean they could look over the fence but I mean you know one I mean we can just enjoy it feels safer than having a renter in a unit that I mean and it's I know that that is not unique I mean that's people have that all the time, but that wasn't there when I\nSpeaker 5: bought the property. So it's just kind of a new.\nSpeaker 0: Exposure that I don't enjoy. It's my daughter and myself, and it.\nSpeaker 5: Just makes me feel a little more vulnerable. Then the decreased property value is something else. So, you know, I'm not sure.\nSpeaker 0: The impact, but I don't think it would increase.\nSpeaker 5: It.\nSpeaker 4: So those are my biggest concerns. And then.\nSpeaker 5: You know, if it is right now, they're, I think, three. Is that correct, Corey?\nSpeaker 4: Three renters. Four.\nSpeaker 5: So there's parking. There's, you know, so all that and then a few. And and have you talked to your next door neighbor about potentially, if they were to move, if they were to get the rezoning, if they were to move back from Steamboat, if they were to then qualify, move back into their house and qualify them for\nSpeaker 5: all of the criteria to apply for the ADU and be able to afford to build it. Given all of the financial challenges of COVID, potentially, maybe like putting up a privacy fence or some sort of, you know, have you have you maybe kicked around a potential compromise here?\nSpeaker 4: We haven't talked the details.\nSpeaker 5: It's been a very.\nSpeaker 0: You know, non contentious discussion with I mean, Corey's.\nSpeaker 5: Been very respectful and I mean, it's been but I just feel like this is my last opportunity to protect myself and my daughter. And so that's why I'm taking it tonight. I don't know how with the proximity that the structure would need to be.\nSpeaker 5: I mean, the privacy.\nSpeaker 0: Fence would.\nSpeaker 5: Have to be very.\nSpeaker 0: High, you know, so short of.\nSpeaker 5: Not having windows on the south side.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not sure how.\nSpeaker 5: You could avoid.\nSpeaker 0: You know, the losing privacy.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Clark.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. And Nate and Livvy, I want to be get this crystal clear here, because I think I think some things were getting inflated. There is no criteria within the rezoning that speaks at all to the residency requirement when it comes to 80 years.\nSpeaker 2: That requirement lives in. If I'm going to rent out both units for a city. Stapleton You know, for a city I think was developed, Stapleton did not intend to live in any of those. They built units with 80 views on zoning that was allowed.\nSpeaker 2: They saw that, in fact, you can buy a structure with an ADU as a rental property and never live in it. You just cannot rent the adieu unless you yourself live in the property. But that is not one of the criteria when we talk about that criteria for rezoning that does not exist anywhere in the rezoning criteria\nSpeaker 2: that only exists in the if I am living in it and I choose to rent the Adu that comes into play at that point. But purchasing an entitlement rezoning that does not live anywhere in those criteria is not correct.\nSpeaker 5: That's correct.\nSpeaker 2: Can I get legal to also confirm that since I know Councilwoman Ortega was talking about the legal criteria that we are required by law to test this application against that criteria of whether someone will live in that structure does not live anywhere in the rezoning criteria.\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct? Nate or I see your son on here as well? That's correct. Councilman Clark, thank you. Okay. So I just wanted to make sure that we were we were talking about two different things. One is, who will eventually own the property and what they will do with that?\nSpeaker 2: And in fact, anyone could go buy a house that has an 82 on it and they could rent that unit. They just can't rent both units. They would have to rent the house with the idea that somebody could use as their office or or whatever.\nSpeaker 2: But the only person who could rent that second unit is the person who lives there. And that does not live anywhere in the rezoning, which is what we have. Barbara, I have a question for you. You had mentioned that this hasn't been contentious and that you've been, you know, kind of evolving over time.\nSpeaker 2: I did notice as I was going through the staff report that the applicant had submitted, you know, kind of a petition with 12 people in support that I'd asked about. I looked closer at that. And you were one of those people who signed that.\nSpeaker 2: And that is, in fact, true, that at that point you thought you were of you changed your mind. Not. You're not asserting that anything was fabricated incorrectly about your support at that point?\nSpeaker 5: No, I was hesitant, but I did sign.\nSpeaker 0: And but as things.\nSpeaker 5: Have moved forward, they've recently.\nSpeaker 0: Moved and it just kind of blew it up. And, you.\nSpeaker 5: Know, the situation.\nSpeaker 0: Changed.\nSpeaker 2: I totally understand. I just wanted to make sure that because I saw your name on there is in support and then you're here in opposition that there was no you know, this wasn't fake. You that was you were was.\nSpeaker 5: Not able known or whatnot.\nSpeaker 2: I just wanted to be crystal clear on that point as well. Thank you, manager or Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 3: Hey, Madam President, I spend a little bit of time listening also, but looking at that map again. And Libby, maybe you can answer this for me. The some of the stars on the map that shows some of the existing arrows, some of which are fairly frequent, fairly recent, rather.\nSpeaker 3: But none of those parcels appears to have been resolved. How how did all those on the north side of July along Clarkson, how did they get approved and built? Wouldn't they have needed a similar rezoning?\nSpeaker 5: So those are already zoned for use, as is the subject site so that most of Platte Park.\nSpeaker 3: And they're in their ones they're in the ones that are allowed on the larger the 5500 square foot.\nSpeaker 5: No they're on the ones that allowed on the smaller so used to be one which is what the applicant is a 44 flats is locus currently at the site of bus us ub1 to the north and the west.\nSpeaker 5: And I do want to put it I know that we've talked a lot about it to use, but because they can already do any of you, this rezoning is really more about rezoning to a district with a smaller lot size than it is about allowing an adu because it does already allow for an 82 use.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. And but in the with the smaller lot size, it has to be an attached.\nSpeaker 5: Right? So because they don't meet the minimum zoned district, lots of size of the current that it would have to be attached there.\nSpeaker 3: So the ones the ones that I did see on Google Street View show that there are they are detached north of dual.\nSpeaker 5: Correct. Yeah. So those would all probably that means so because those are all in the US U be one zoned district. They have a minimum lot size of at least 4500 square feet which is of the applicant is applying for.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So they can do the the detached the ones that are in the C one.\nSpeaker 1: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 3: They are. I saw one there that was also detached.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So that. Yep. So we would have to have at least a minimum zone size of 5500 square feet. And if you look across the street on Clarkson, a lot of those lots are around 7000 square feet and there's a lot of 60 to 50 lots in the neighborhood as well.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: All right, Councilman Hines.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. So. Is it possible that this was actually just an oversight in the 2010 rezoning or whatever the you know, whenever this particular plot was set up, that it was just a oops because it's it's right next to a whole bunch of other plot centers owned by one.\nSpeaker 2: And this one happens to be C one.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Know, I'm not exactly sure. It is interesting how the lines are. There's a lot of you know, normally you'll see there's there's more rectangular where the district boundaries are but in plot park it is kind of very zigzag on where it changes from B to C and then B one to just be.\nSpeaker 5: So I'm not exactly sure what.\nSpeaker 2: The I guess I'm asking you to say, did some of your team screw up back in 2010? So and I'm not trying to do that, but but it just seems to me like this might this might have just been a noose.\nSpeaker 2: And and I do I very much respect your comment about this isn't about an issue. You can put an issue on his property right now. And I think that's a really important distinction because all the letters of opposition are about the ADA.\nSpeaker 2: So at least as I understand it. So I think that's a I think that's an interesting and important distinction. So thank you. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flynn, I see you lowered your hand. All right. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0576 is closed. Comments by members of council. Councilman Clark.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I wanted to thank Barbara for coming down and being our Sloan speaker on this. So thank you for that, for taking time for sticking with us. So 930 at night, really appreciate that. I also live in Plattsburgh and I also have a house that sits way closer to the property line than would\nSpeaker 2: currently be allowed under the zoning code because these homes were built before those rules. And so mine is I think I have a couple more inches than you. I think I'm 20 inches from the property line on on one side, which causes all kinds of interesting issues when you try to touch anything on your house because now\nSpeaker 2: your entire house is in the wrong place and you can't move a house over. It also, I think, creates a lot of we have a lot of houses. You know, the minimum lot size frontage on the block that I live in is only 25 feet.\nSpeaker 2: And so we're going about 25 feet, then another house, then another house. You have a lot of these issues of privacy, right? When you are only about 25 feet from width before one neighbor and the next neighbor. And it's not just around 80 use.\nSpeaker 2: It's also there are a lot of historic one story structures and then someone builds a two storey and it goes back further than the one story. And now you have a two story home where the third you're looking directly into somebody's backyard and attached to you.\nSpeaker 2: And this would certainly create that condition where an attached to you doesn't get rid of the privacy concern by being on the back. You're overlooking the alley potentially or the other garage. The extension of of an attached to you could be looking directly on to the backyard, which we see a lot in that park where someone has\nSpeaker 2: , you know, a smaller house that started here. Somebody does in addition on the back. Another addition is looking two stories into a backyard. And, you know, it's one of the not fun things. We even have a couple of cases where people put solar panels on a one story home and the next door neighbor uses their use.\nSpeaker 2: My right to build up two stories and blocks part of their solar, how much energy they're creating during those winter months. And as part of that, you know, this is not an, you know, a suburban zone district. This is a is an urban edge, the urban zone district where there is all of that happening.\nSpeaker 2: There's light rail stations and there's wood that don't have parking lots because they're walkable and there are embedded commercial districts, all of that causing conflict and turmoil. I think that what we are charged with here tonight is, is that those are issues that come with, you know, density in the kind of neighborhood that this is and has\nSpeaker 2: been for a hundred years. What we're charged with is, does this meet the legal criteria for rezoning? And beyond that, looking at, you know, taking into account what what do the people around think and feel? You know, I think that the three page letter to me was a non opposition letter.\nSpeaker 2: It was that we can't support this. It didn't say we adamantly opposed this. And the reason that they didn't support it was spot rezoning, which was a very real thing that was not allowed in Denver until a couple of years ago, when the minimum lot size for a rezoning application changed and now it is legal to put\nSpeaker 2: forward an application for a single lot that is 4600 square feet. That was it three years ago. And so that that is some of the language that's still around. It's something that would have prevented this from ever happening a couple years ago.\nSpeaker 2: But that is allowable in today. Of the five letters in opposition that were that were received by staff, two of them were about something that can never happen there. There's the medical office and the rest were about issues with a use in general.\nSpeaker 2: This property is already zoned for an 80 it already could build in 82. Those problems are part of that urban fabric problem, that problem that we have as our city continues to see people move into it and change.\nSpeaker 2: They're not necessarily problems with the change between the B and the C. We have over the time that I've been here, had big rezonings that take something that was single family zoned district and move it all the way to five, six, eight storeys.\nSpeaker 2: And then we have small rezonings, which most of the time look like I can't have a air to you, and now I can answer you by adding that one on the end. This one is even smaller than that.\nSpeaker 2: I can't remember a change that is smaller in in what it allows. The next 80 year old is allowed. It can be attached now. It has to be detached. We're not even adding the right for an 82 that's already there for everyone on this block and all the blocks around it, you know, in three of the four\nSpeaker 2: directions allow for this smaller lot size because that is the cadence. And if you look at the map, that's the cadence on this side of the block. When you get to the other side of the block, the cadence starts to be slightly smaller lots.\nSpeaker 2: So I think that this is tough because we all want to sit here with everybody happy and everybody saying, this is exactly what I want. I want to be clear that the the set, the unit rental, the renting of two units.\nSpeaker 2: At the same time, which again, was was one of Barbara's main concerns. That is not allowed. That cannot be allowed. But that is not a part of our rezoning criteria. Whereas in a different place, in the same way that, hey, I'm worried you won't bow your weeds or have too many dogs on site is something that is\nSpeaker 2: valid to be concerned about when you live next door to people. But it's not something that is a criteria for zoning. It is not something that is controlled by zoning. It lives elsewhere and we have to be vigilant as more and more to use come online in our community.\nSpeaker 2: But it's not those use are not being abused in a way that they were not intended to be when we said, hey, you can't brant that out as if it was a duplex that is you have to live there if you want to rent the other thing.\nSpeaker 2: But the ownership can change three times in the next year. And that law, that's why that law doesn't live in the zoning because we're not zoning to one owner. We're zoning to everyone who will own that property after.\nSpeaker 2: We'll all be beholden to that rule, and we have to make sure that we're enforcing it at the end of the day. It comes down to does this meet the legal criteria? And I think that there's clearly, as staff has demonstrated, thank you, Libby, for all your hard work on this.\nSpeaker 2: It does meet the legal criteria. I will just end by saying that the Councilman Hines point earlier. I don't believe that just because we haven't had an edu that's been turned back yet that we never will. Each of these applications is based on does this application meet the legal criteria?\nSpeaker 2: What we are what we are tasked with doing here, and we may get someone who comes and applies for an edu that does not meet the legal criteria and not one would get turned back. But I believe that this one has been clearly demonstrated that this small change from attached to you to detached to you from see\nSpeaker 2: to be is something that meets the legal criteria for rezoning. And for that reason I will be voting to support it tonight, and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Torres.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 5: I really.\nSpeaker 0: Appreciate all the back and.\nSpeaker 5: Forth to clarify this, because it is more.\nSpeaker 0: Complex than even the one.\nSpeaker 5: That just came before it. And in my district and.\nSpeaker 0: A lot of things.\nSpeaker 5: That get raised in.\nSpeaker 0: Terms of what do we oppose and and and what's before.\nSpeaker 5: Us right now, what I what I do want to.\nSpeaker 0: Say, because I do think the.\nSpeaker 5: Criteria has been.\nSpeaker 0: Met even elsewhere in this.\nSpeaker 5: Neighborhood, is that this actually brings up one of.\nSpeaker 0: The other needs that that Denver has, which is. Councilwoman Gilmore, you initiated, I think, a conversation around this last year.\nSpeaker 4: And others, but.\nSpeaker 5: A rental registry and really being able to make sure that we know exactly where rentals are and who's allowing them, because I even in in in my district, what we wouldn't.\nSpeaker 0: Want were for folks, whether it's in Barnham who have the entitlement to build a to use or elsewhere throughout the district who apply for.\nSpeaker 5: It to then.\nSpeaker 0: Rent out both.\nSpeaker 4: Units and you.\nSpeaker 0: Really start to lose control of a.\nSpeaker 5: Lot of the neighborhood character and.\nSpeaker 0: Livability of.\nSpeaker 5: Neighborhoods. When you don't have that primary occupant there who is the property owners.\nSpeaker 0: So that's.\nSpeaker 4: Definitely one thing that.\nSpeaker 5: I know we've got to get a handle on for Denver as we start to create more credibility throughout the city.\nSpeaker 0: I think you all have. And. Q Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. I'm having a difficult time with the fact that an 80 and attached 88 was already allowed here, and the rezoning is being sought so that he can do something that doesn't really apply except for this particular guidance in a blueprint about is there an established pattern on the surrounding blocks?\nSpeaker 3: And for that reason, under criteria too, that's one of those criteria that always boggles my mind. Uniformity of District Regulations. The proposed rezoning will result in uniform application of zone district building for museum design regulations. That's that's a tautology, right?\nSpeaker 3: Of course, if we rezoning to this particular district, will will apply those rules. But the question is, you can add an aide. The issue for me is you can add an eight you already. It has to be attached because of the lot size.\nSpeaker 3: And for that reason, I don't believe that it actually will conform with criteria to. So I don't know. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Sandoval.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Madam President. So two councilman talks points to the fact that the city is not auditing where owner occupied entities are going. I think is is it's a concern. And we've heard it tonight and I, I have these throughout northwest Denver.\nSpeaker 5: They keep popping up. And what's really challenging for me is it's the zoning code is this was this was a 2010 legislative rezoning that we are just barely even ten years later figuring out some of the issues. So Councilman Quinn's point, I have some conflicts here.\nSpeaker 5: So right now I continue to listen to other comments. But this one is really challenging. I think you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sawyer.\nSpeaker 5: Thanks, Madam President. Yeah, I am. Along the same lines of my as my colleagues. You know, frankly, I 80 years are the compromise for the neighborhoods who feel very strongly about, you know, preserving their character for the neighborhoods who like, you know, the the grass and who like the the feel of old Denver 80 years are the\nSpeaker 5: compromise. Because we've got to add the gentle density. We have to be able to bring in the affordability somehow. All of the neighborhoods, you know, Blueprint says all of the neighborhoods have to share the burden of growth in our city.\nSpeaker 5: And so to use or that compromise. But I am I'm incredibly concerned about the idea that we are not as a city doing more to ensure that as we are as we are bringing ADAS into our neighborhoods. We don't have eyes on whether people are following the laws that we have set forth around those ideas, because the\nSpeaker 5: buck stops with us and the responsibility lies with us to ensure and we are the ones who are going to hear about it when you know those laws are broken. And that is incredibly concerning. So. Well, I understand, you know, and then there's also this sort of health and safety issue and privacy issue around, like Councilman Clark\nSpeaker 5: was saying, around the fact that there are the setbacks in this neighborhood like there are in some of the other neighborhoods, which potentially I don't know, I would, I guess, have to go back and look at the legislative history.\nSpeaker 5: But maybe that's why the these parcels were not zoned for detached dwellings in the first place. Maybe that's why they were only zoned for attached dwellings in the first place because of those privacy issues, because they're already they're already zoned for 80 use, but they're just zoned for attached to use, not detached areas.\nSpeaker 5: So I guess I am I have my concerns about this one in particular based on the specific facts of this case. But I think, you know, I'm torn because it is so incredibly important that we are bringing to use to to our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 5: But like you said, there are 80 is already in this neighborhood. It's not like they can't have one. This is not about yes or no 80 you this is about detached versus attached to you based on the specific facts of this case.\nSpeaker 5: And I'm uncomfortable with what we're looking at in terms of the information we've been given tonight. So I'm going to also keep listening. Thanks so much.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Hines.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. We are a growing city. And where is the secrets out? And and people want to move to our beautiful slice of of the planet. And and as we can continue to grow is going to find a place to put people and I'm not trying to say that our five legal criteria are are about\nSpeaker 2: finding places to put people. But but I would say that I know that my district is very vibrant and we have a lot of people who to resist change, but we also have a lot of people who live in tents.\nSpeaker 2: And and people are angry. They're angry that they that there are people living in tents at the end of their block and the right of way or across the street. Yet they also resist even the gentlest of additional density as in an area.\nSpeaker 2: And this situation, this this isn't even about whether there is an idea or not. It's that, I guess to to the point, is detached or unattached and well an attached to you could also be above a garage that would be on the second floor and have the same privacy concerns or the same concerns about looking over a\nSpeaker 2: fence. And and, in fact, we're going to hear about that very soon. So that's you know, that is so I don't know if how attached or detached really solves the privacy concern. I, I also know that I'm not that that my world has to be everyone else's world.\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, President excuse me, Councilmember Clark mentioned a bit about his house. I know that when I first purchased my unit in October 2011, I had a beautiful view of downtown, of course, feel the mountains, and now I have a view of a whole bunch of bedrooms.\nSpeaker 2: And that's not really exciting to me. I'd rather have the view of the mountains, but we also are in a growing city and and if we want to live close to the mountains, we want to live close to the national parks.\nSpeaker 2: And if we want to live in a city that's vibrant, that has good economy, good jobs, we have to also recognize that that so we have to make some accommodations. And if we start turning down to and we're going to get more scrapes and and there are like Congress parks, the vast majority of the homes that are\nSpeaker 2: built in in Congress Park are built before 1940, as in the the the marker that, you know, the oldest identifier in the in the in the spectrum. And so if we start saying we're not going to have any use and this is just, you know, in general, there's a not specifically to the five credible, but just in\nSpeaker 2: general, we started saying no to eight years. We're saying yes to scrapes and we started saying no to a use. We're saying yes to destroying a historic character. And and so, you know, there's some value discussion that we that we should have outside of this particular conversation.\nSpeaker 2: But in this particular conversation, I don't see how this doesn't meet the criteria. And and I'm not saying that my colleagues are wrong. I'm saying that, in my opinion, this is meets the legal five legal criteria points that we have to we have to consider.\nSpeaker 2: And and whether the person lives there or not is certainly irritating to me. Thanks for going after Steamboat and and kind of adding more wrenches into the into the mix. But but that's not part of the legal criteria.\nSpeaker 2: So I can be irritated and still say yes because because we are supposed to be arbiters or quasi judges right now, and I am not making decisions based on irritation. So thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Up next, we have Councilman Herndon.\nSpeaker 2: The thing about a president I appreciate everyone's conversation is when you originally look at this. But sometimes when you have hearings, you think it's going to go one way and it goes in a different direction. I applaud everyone's comments and thoughtful considerations on this for me.\nSpeaker 2: I don't want to reiterate the point of people will say so. I will I will tell Councilman Clarke, I really appreciate your comments. I think you're spot on. I do think the criteria has been met. And I would say I would say this to the name of Barbara.\nSpeaker 2: Forgive me. I wrote the name down. Right. My apologies. You said you were concerned because you left. Well, the reality is, since he's not there, that the the timeline of this isn't even close, because as we have we have talked about a lot, this isn't giving him the opportunity to build the A-Team.\nSpeaker 2: This is just as a property owner for the rezoning, and that is it. And so I don't believe that we should look at him, not be in mayor as a reason to deny that. I think the criteria is quite clear and I'm glad that we have to do that to we will be sticking to.\nSpeaker 2: And I want to say for Councilman Sawyer, I thought you made a great point for making your questions earlier. The property owner now has to move back. Then they have to decide to do it. And then there's the financing financing issue.\nSpeaker 2: And then do they then they actually build. And so for my colleagues who are concerned about as a city, do we have the mechanism in place to better track this? Well, there's time if we're dealing with this particular issue that we're concerned about, this particular property, and this is probably happening elsewhere.\nSpeaker 2: But let's let's have this conversation with the administration that this is our concern. Let's move forward with that. So I do believe that this is appropriate and has met the criteria. And I will be supportive and I would ask my colleagues to do the same.\nSpeaker 2: And I wanted to say this too. I really want to I was felt good seeing this is that neighbors disagree, but they weren't disagreeable. And so I hope that this can this can happen in other conversations, because usually when neighbors disagree, it's much more contentious than this.\nSpeaker 2: And I wanted to applaud all the parties for being neighborly when it comes to this. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. And seen no one else in the queue to make comments, I'll share my own. This was a really robust, great conversation. I didn't know exactly what path we were going to go down and just appreciate everybody's contribution to it.\nSpeaker 0: And and I have to appreciate Nate, because it was really helpful to to hear you explain the entitlement process is through this rezoning and that really the owner occupied piece wasn't something that that we through our quasi judicial role right now in this rezoning we need to really look at those five criteria for the rezoning.\nSpeaker 0: And I do believe that those five criteria have been met for this rezoning. And so I will be voting in favor of it as well. And with that, Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Right.\nSpeaker 3: Flynn now.\nSpeaker 4: Herndon. Hi. Hi.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 4: Cashman.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 5: Can each.\nSpeaker 4: I Ortega. So. Sandoval.\nSpeaker 5: Pass. Yeah.\nSpeaker 4: Sawyer. I. Torres.\nSpeaker 0: I. Black.\nSpeaker 4: CdeBaca. Sandoval.\nSpeaker 5: I.\nSpeaker 4: Council President.\nSpeaker 0: I. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results.\nSpeaker 5: Two days.\nSpeaker 4: Ten days.\nSpeaker 0: Ten Eyes Council Bill 576 has passed there being no further business before this body. This meeting is adjourned.\nSpeaker 6: She tries to clap along with.\nSpeaker 5: That's a cheat, but not. Just a friend from head to toe.\nSpeaker 0: But whiskey is one of the.\nSpeaker 6: First time. You know, you have to ask.\nSpeaker 0: Though, she's a bit overzealous.\nSpeaker 5: Missing her late shows.\n",

Councilman Brown, will you please put Council Bill nine for one on the floor?\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. President. I move that Councilor Bill 941 be ordered, publish a do pass.\nSpeaker 4: And wait for technology to come on, because we're going to need a second. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: But.\nSpeaker 4: But I will correct that in the system. The public hearing for accountable 941 is open. May we have the staff report?\nSpeaker 0: Hello. I'm Diane Dilulio with Department of Environmental Health. And we thank you for this opportunity to present the staff report. D.H. commends the zoo's multiple efforts to minimize waste that would otherwise go to a landfill, including their recycling and composting programs and now their proposed waste to energy facility.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, sir. Then I felt that you can be heard. Go. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 0: Could I start over?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, please. If you could start over, you just.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Commence the zoo's multiple efforts to minimize waste that would otherwise go to a landfill, including their recycling and composting programs, and now their proposed waste to energy facility, all of which are focused on the zoo's objective to be a zero waste facility by 2025 and and recommends approval of this waste to energy facility.\nSpeaker 0: Since the waste to energy facility is viewed by the city and the state as a form of waste disposal, special reviews and approvals are needed, including issuing a certificate of designation which for the city means passing an ordinance.\nSpeaker 0: According to the city's Revised Municipal Code, Section 40 3-103. When considering whether to approve a certificate of designation, the Council shall take into account one the effects of the facility on nearby surroundings to the convenience of the facility to potential users.\nSpeaker 0: Three The the ability of the facility to comply with city and state environmental health regulations and rules, and for how the facility fits in with the city's comprehensive plan. Additionally, five Council also needs to consider and state approvals.\nSpeaker 0: The planned waste to energy facility meets these code requirements for the following reasons. One There are no expected never negative impacts on nearby surroundings because of proactive monitoring by the zoo and the design features of the waste to energy facility to the waste to energy facility is very convenient to the zoo and city.\nSpeaker 0: Who will be the users? Three. Regarding compliance, the zoo has obtained the state required permits and with DEA will conduct compliance monitoring to meet environmental health regulations and rules. Is satisfied that the zoo will meet its compliance obligations.\nSpeaker 0: And four regarding the comprehensive plan. Denver Parks and Recreation determined that the waste to energy facility at the zoo serves a substantial purpose in supporting the operation of the zoo. Also, the facility is in line with the city, with the city's sustainability goals with respect to energy and waste reduction.\nSpeaker 0: Additionally, five reviews the waste to energy documents submitted by the zoo and concurs with the state regulators in recommending approval of the certificate of designation for the zoo's waste to energy facility. D.H. notes that throughout this evaluation, the zoo involved other city departments and the state regulators, and it engaged in a robust effort to involve external stakeholders\nSpeaker 0: and the zoo incorporated environmental permits and mechanisms for tracking environmental compliance in their planned waste to energy facility operations. D.H. has a strong working relationship with the zoo, including record review, environmental auditing and regular inspections to assist the zoo and compliance with existing permits.\nSpeaker 0: Inspections associated with the Waste to energy facility will be incorporated into his ongoing partnership with the Zoo to ensure compliance. For these reasons, DHS requests Council's approval of this ordinance. Thank you. And I'd like to introduce Shannon BLOCK from the Denver Zoo.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. So hi. My name is Shannon Bloch and I'm president and CEO of Denver Zoo. And I loved what you guys said earlier about Natty, about caring and collaboration and advocacy. And I'm here to reassure you, we've heard recent concerns from our neighbors regarding the south side of the zoo.\nSpeaker 9: And we all definitely take a role in making our neighborhoods better. And we're taking the comments we receive to heart. I also wanted to make you aware that we've invested over $700,000 on exterior facing improvements in that area thus far, including Duck Lake improvements, sidewalk landscape amenities and the installation of the first phase of our architectural fence\nSpeaker 9: . We may remain committed to our efforts within Parks and Recreation Department to continue these improvements, and we have plans in 2015 working with Parks and Recreation to create a seamless process for future communication and collaboration on our planned exterior facing improvements.\nSpeaker 9: I have earmarked significant funds in our budget to implement the next phase, which will include additional amenities to beautify the Southside, and I look forward to implementing them with community input in the next year. However, tonight is about a totally separate topic and nothing should take away from the excitement of tonight, which is a final step in\nSpeaker 9: the process, allowing us to operate our waste to energy system inside the building that has already been built to house this exciting technology. The waste to energy system is a game changer for sustainability and environmental stewardship. This will allow us to reduce our solid waste to landfills by 90%.\nSpeaker 9: It will power all of our elephant passage and power nearly 20% of Denver Zoo. We're the greenest zoo in North America, and we are committed to continuing to keep this bar high for future generations. So please know how much I appreciate your past and continued support as we finalize this amazing project that is going to put us\nSpeaker 9: one giant step closer to becoming a zero waste facility. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you both for that presentation. We have six speaker sign up today and I'm going to go ahead and call all six and ask that you make your way to the first pew for comments. Hank Boots, Nancy Francis, Thad, Texa, Lewis Koski, Bridget Walsh and Mr. Sekou.\nSpeaker 4: So Hank Boots, you can go ahead and begin your comments. Sure. Madam Secretary, can you grab.\nSpeaker 1: Hi. I want to start by thanking the Council in reference.\nSpeaker 11: To Netty for supporting and encouraging neighborhood activists.\nSpeaker 1: I don't oppose the concept of W.T.. I oppose the sense of entitlement that.\nSpeaker 3: The zoo.\nSpeaker 11: And museum have regarding City Park. The fact that DPR operates without oversight of elected officials has resulted in encroachment on the park by the zoo and museum to the tipping point. The issue before the council is a certificate of designation, but it's really an exemption.\nSpeaker 11: The real exemption is the esthetics who was brought up. The zoo plans to beautify the South End, but that should have been presented when park land was given to the zoo. The system won't change the look of the fence line.\nSpeaker 3: Or zoo footprint.\nSpeaker 11: Footprint. But it was already changed for elephant passage. And as an environmental steward and good neighbor, Denver's, who commits to ensuring the system meets standards, they should run their system properly. But otherwise, how has the zoo been a good neighbor to City Park?\nSpeaker 11: How has the zoo been a good neighbor to the neighbors of City Park? I've lived there for 40 years. I can't list a lot of things as it stands. We've been told that Denver Parks and Rec runs autonomously and council does not control them.\nSpeaker 11: I think that should change given the circumstances. Our group, City Park Friends and Neighbors, had a recent meeting with Mr. Brooks in which he endorsed the idea of gathering all interested parties to confer periodically about city park issues.\nSpeaker 11: We'd like to go further and propose a neighborhood advisory committee for City Park. Such groups already exist, such as for Botanic Gardens and would include representation from the institutions as well as Orientals. I urge Council to delay approval of this proposal and endorse support of the formation of a neighborhood advisory committee.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Boots. Nancy Francis.\nSpeaker 0: I'm Nancy Francis.\nSpeaker 9: I live on Vine Street, two blocks west of City Park. I speak today to urge City Council to delay a second reading of the proposed bill to authorize the zoo to operate an industrial process in City Park. To be very clear, the issue is not a referendum on sustainability or the very laudable goal of waste to energy\nSpeaker 9: processing. Rather, the issue in front of council is one of oversight. You have visual evidence illustrating what failure of oversight has produced so far, and industrial facilities sits as a wart on the landscape, a permanent defacement of City Park planted in the very midst of its most historic and heavily used areas.\nSpeaker 9: Another recent illustration of the zoo's lack of regard for city park occurred during boo at the zoo. The zoo and Denver Parks and Recreation work together with our citizens to treat City Park as the zoo's overflow parking lot.\nSpeaker 9: Signs posted at 23rd Avenue Red Lots Full Trice City Park Motor Coaches patrolled city parks throughout the two day event, shuttling passengers from stops labeled with large animal banners. Parks and Recreation helpfully cleared Park City Park's event calendar for the weekend.\nSpeaker 9: Citizens have asked for family weekends free of events in City Park. We don't even merit a hearing on that suggestion. It's viewed as controversial. And just last week, more turf was turned out along Fair Lake to be paved in concrete up to the bandstand to make it easier for equipment vans to drop off sound equipment.\nSpeaker 9: The manager of Parks and Recreation has unilaterally declared that the zoo's waste process is a valid use of park land and did not even deign to notify the public of her decision. Do you believe that one political appointee who has no credentials in industrial, mechanical or manufacturing, manufacturing, engineering or in power generation should make this land use\nSpeaker 9: decision without public scrutiny. It may be legally authorized by current Denver ordinance, but is this appropriate? Is it good stewardship to place so much control in the hands of a single appointed official who is not even required to reside in the city and county of Denver?\nSpeaker 9: You cannot rely solely on the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to regulate the zoo's industrial process. The state's permit considers only emissions. In fact, they have told us that the division does not have the authority to deny a permit based on community awareness, land use and noise.\nSpeaker 9: These issues are addressed at the local and county level. Consider this very carefully, please. You are talking about an industrial process in a public park, city park, in the midst of residential neighborhoods with no oversight by the city and county of Denver.\nSpeaker 9: Before you consider the proposed bill, I ask you to take two steps. First, establish an oversight body to provide a means to engage citizens in the process of decisions that impact City Park, modeled after the Neighborhood Advisory Committee in the Denver Botanic Gardens.\nSpeaker 9: Intellectual property issues can easily be addressed for inside.\nSpeaker 4: Descriptions as your 3 minutes is up. I'm sorry. You have to. And I want to make sure I get the rules right. If you want to defer your time to you, do it during the recess. Or can you do it during the.\nSpeaker 6: No, it's usually.\nSpeaker 4: It's during the recess.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. You say.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I era as well.\nSpeaker 8: This is the landmark.\nSpeaker 4: And so, my friends, I do I do apologize. Your time is up, so.\nSpeaker 8: I can't you my time. That's alright. You can read the rest of it. There's no need to absent.\nSpeaker 4: Absolutely. Mr. Text, you are making bad text.\nSpeaker 1: We'll get it. And don't worry. This is just a fun time to use fad tax of 4535 Julian Street Denver, Colorado. As long as we're talking about waste, it seems to be a wasted opportunity not to take the red light, find money out of the general fund and earmarked for homeless services.\nSpeaker 1: After all, they're among the most vulnerable populations in our crosswalks. It seems only fitting that they ought to benefit from the hazardous behavior that endangers them. Also, given your general unwillingness to spend money on the homeless, nobody would ever think you're using the fines as a revenue raising device.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Tex. Luis Pawlikowski. And I apologize if I mispronounced the.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening and thank you. My name is Louis Chelsea. I'm the president of City Park. Friends and Neighbors. We're an R.A. that includes the neighborhood surrounding City Park. We have over 300 members. I am also on the board of Greater Park Hill Community Association, and I'm a stakeholder with income agency, the Inter Neighborhood Cooperative.\nSpeaker 3: I have attended discussions and read various documents about the zoo's waste treatment plan. There have been a number of issues that have been cast in a somewhat skewed and cloudy light by the percentage of the zoo plan. It has been stated that INC, Greater Park Hill and City Park Alliance have given their blessings to the zoo plan\nSpeaker 3: . I'll read you a part of Hank's letter that was dated December 8th. Any perceived approval of this project was gleaned from the minutes of the INC park meetings, and the preliminary approval was only in respect to the concept of waste gasification and in no way should have been used by City Council to imply the main body of\nSpeaker 3: ink either knew about the set design, scale orientation or approval of the gasification plan. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a far cry from approval of the zoo's plan. I've also had discussions with both grade Park Hill board members and president of City Park Alliance, where they mirrored the sentiments of the ink letter.\nSpeaker 3: We at City Park, friends and neighbors agree wholeheartedly. The response from these organizations is uniform. After the zoo's presentation, a request for more information was put to the presenters. Once the information is made available, then perhaps the plant could have agreement by all.\nSpeaker 3: Unfortunately, that was not the case. The main points that need to be addressed are air quality, smell, noise, visual impact, risk management and location. Why wasn't the facility built with consideration to its appearance from the park? Why couldn't the facility been located offsite or at least further from the park boundary?\nSpeaker 3: Why is the zoo, the park and a neighborhood being used as a laboratory for this new technology? We therefore request that approval be delayed and now see a neighborhood advisory committee be formed from the neighborhood R.A. And that the zoo includes said next in its deliberations so that the plan can be perhaps approved by all parties.\nSpeaker 3: We look to you as our representatives to make certain that the crown jewel of our city city park remains as was always intended. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Bridgette. Walt.\nSpeaker 8: I'm Bridget Walsh, and I live in Park Hill, and I'm also a board member of City Park Friends and Neighbors. I would like to read some observations about the risks of the gasification process. From Wikipedia on the subject of biomass gasification.\nSpeaker 8: Environmental advocates have called gasification incineration in disguise and argued that the technology is still dangerous to air quality and public health. Since 2003, numerous proposals for raise for waste treatment facilities hoping to use gasification technologies, fail to receive final approval to operate when the claims of project proponents did not withstand public and government scrutiny of key claims\nSpeaker 8: . According to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, one facility, which operated from 2009 to 2011 and Ottawa, had 29 emission incidences, 13 spills, and over those three years, it was only able to operate roughly 25, 25% of the time.\nSpeaker 8: The second observation is from the European Commission report guidelines for safe and eco friendly biomass gasification. The technology of biomass gasification differs from other energy conservation technologies based on renewable energy sources, because it inherently involves the production, treatment and utilization of flammable and toxic gas mixtures.\nSpeaker 8: Plant, media and utilities. Therefore, an adequate risk assessment is strongly recommended, is often a legal requirement for placing the plant into the market and running it. A risk assessment is aimed at protecting the workers in the plant itself.\nSpeaker 8: Manufacturers. Operators have to keep in mind that accidents and ill health can ruin lives and can affect the business too. If the output is lost, machinery is damaged, insurance cost increase. So there is a possibility of prosecution. A risk assessment consists of a careful examination of what could harm, what causes harm to the people and environment in\nSpeaker 8: the plant. Some considerations are human and animal health hazards, such as dangers from toxic gases, safety issues such as explosion hazards and fire hazards and environment hazards from plant emissions, and loss of containment relating to toxic substances. While Denver voters may never have the opportunity to judge the risk assessment plant at the zoo's industrial waste plant, because\nSpeaker 8: much like oil and gas companies refuse to give first responders information about the trade secrets, content of the fracking solutions they are injecting into the earth. The zoo has wrapped up much of the they are needed to for a robust citizen and government agency review of their proposals.\nSpeaker 8: As trade secrets are confidential business information, I suggest that citizen health and safety is much more important than the future profits of the Denver Zoological Foundation, who, along with DPR, run the zoo with an iron hand that is symbolized by the Gulag style gate 15, the back door to the zoo, but an ugly, deep wound on historic\nSpeaker 8: city park. I implore you to put this project on hold until there is a legitimate neighborhood advisory committee set up to evaluate for the first time the zoo's gasification proposal and the light of day, the risks seem very serious and potentially deadly for park users and neighborhood residents.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Miss Walsh. Mr.. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Chairman Sekou. Founder of the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Advocacy group for poor, working, poor and homeless people. First of all, I would like to thank Miss Nancy Francis for giving me the honor of reading what she didn't have time to read.\nSpeaker 1: That is thoroughly reasonable. In the States. Before you consider the proposed bill, we ask that you take two, two steps. One, establish an oversight body. To provide a means to engage citizens in the process of decisions that impact City Park.\nSpeaker 1: Modeled that after a neighborhood advisory committee in Denver's Botanic Gardens, reason to take it tour. I mean, I went down there to see this before you vote on this. Right. And take a tour by a guided neighborhood resident who lives there so they can give you its perspective about what they're talking about.\nSpeaker 1: See a picture and say, beats a whole bunch of words, man. You can see what they're talking about. All right. Nodding. So don't rubberstamp this, please, she said. Operation of an industrial process in City Park, which we call the crown jewel queen city of Denver.\nSpeaker 1: Wait. Until oversight and control mechanisms are in place that will ensure the success of the zoo while protecting our city park, its users and neighborhoods. Everybody coming up here opposed to it. What does that tell you? Do you hear him now?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, City City Council. I mean, the city attorney, we was an operations meeting and there was this rule called 106 called Pay Attention, you act judicious like look like you're paying attention even when you ain't. Yeah, I remember that one.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And while they were speaking out, watch people do everything but listen to them. Except for a few people. He wasn't focused on what they were talking about. You couldn't repeat one word. They say it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker 1: See, they don't come every day. I do. I saw you paying attention. Don't lose your father too much. But you know who else was up here? Charlie picking his nose.\nSpeaker 4: Mr. Sinclair. Looking at. Mr.. Mr.. Mr.. Mr.. Mr.. Sekou. Mr.. Speaker, I appreciate. I appreciate.\nSpeaker 11: Your.\nSpeaker 4: Honor. This is a coup. Thank you for your comments. Sit down if you can. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, please. Thank you, Mr. Sekou. All right, that concludes. That concludes the speakers. Council members. Are there any are there any questions?\nSpeaker 4: Any questions from members of council?\nSpeaker 2: Yep.\nSpeaker 4: All right. Count Catwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 8: So I first want to ask, what is the existing process that is utilized to dispose of the waste at the zoo today? Shannon, would you mind coming forward and explaining the process and you know, how long does the waste sit there?\nSpeaker 8: Some of those kinds of things?\nSpeaker 9: Absolutely. Those are good questions. And Jorge is our expert, so I'm going to have him answer them. But any questions for me also? I'll be right here.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. My name is George Parnham, the vice president for design and campus management at Denver Zoo. And I appreciate the question. We currently manage our solid waste in the south side of the zoo, and we have since the early 1970s, we have two disposal processes.\nSpeaker 11: One is a compactor that takes our waste compacts. It holds it for about a week and hauls it off to landfill. And we have a dumpster that takes manure and takes that on a weekly basis to a composting facility.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. My next question is to ask the person from Environmental Health spoke to elaborate a little bit about the certificate of designation. I remember we used this process when we had a medical waste incinerator that tried to open in the Swansea, a neighborhood many years ago.\nSpeaker 8: And I don't recall that it is solely limited to industrial zoning. So can you speak to where the certificate of designation is allowed to be applied under the zoning code?\nSpeaker 0: I don't know about under the zoning code. I do know that it's on a case by case basis and it's based on well, it's a document that allows land use for waste treatment disposal.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. I have some other questions, but I know we have other members, so I'm happy to defer and come back.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Brooks?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you. Mr. President, I have a couple of questions and I think one of them on our Shannon's up here. But Andrew. Andrew, why don't you come up here? I want to talk about kind of the outreach process that you all did.\nSpeaker 2: Did you do an outreach process? Please kind of elaborate on what you all do with the community.\nSpeaker 11: Absolutely. Andrew Rowan, government affairs manager for Denver Zoo. We started telling the story of waste to energy in 2009 and are due at the zoo event. At that point we started sharing some of our ideas and processes with our main supporters just to get some of their feedback.\nSpeaker 11: Beyond that, we took on a much more formal approach when it came to the neighborhood groups and also city council. Starting at the beginning of 2013, we met with every city council member and briefed them on the process and briefed them on the technology and the ideas we had.\nSpeaker 11: Along with that, we also met with all registered neighborhood organizations, all registered neighborhood organizations. At the time, City Park Friends and Neighbors was not registered until early 2014, so they were not in the process that was outlined throughout the year of 2013.\nSpeaker 11: But we did meet with every registered neighborhood organization and we received feedback. We shared the plans. The PowerPoint that we shared was very similar to the one that is on the city council website right now that was shared with the Infrastructure and Culture Committee.\nSpeaker 11: Beyond that, we also made presentations to specific stakeholders. So we reached out to the specific RINO's and had them send representatives. We also made a presentation to the INC Park Committee as well, so we feel like we did a very thorough public outreach process.\nSpeaker 11: We received overwhelming support at that time. Now there was a little gap in between when we did our outreach and becoming and coming in front of council. The last nine months are eat up or our engineering and design plans have been under review by city and state officials.\nSpeaker 11: That is what that is what accounts for the gap between our outreach and coming in front of council about nine months later.\nSpeaker 2: And you all had a change in leadership during that time as well. Did that affect any of the outreach or the communication?\nSpeaker 11: Yeah, we've had several changes at our CEO position and also our government affairs and external relations. Vice President, they are both no longer with Denver Zoo, so we are picking up where they left off and entering this process.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Just just another question. And I believe maybe environmental health can can answer this question. That was one of the folks who was from the Sea Girt Curtis Park City Park Friends and Neighbors group talked about the kind of air pollution that gasification may cause.\nSpeaker 2: Do you all know anything about that?\nSpeaker 0: Or there is a specific permit that the zoo was required to have?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Come to the mike.\nSpeaker 0: Which requires them to monitor for exhaust, and perhaps the zoo can tell a little bit more about their their permit.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, that'd be great.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. There's the permit that we're talking about tonight is the solid waste permit. There's a permit that also is specific to the air emissions. That permit is handled by the State Department of Public Health and Environment. On behalf of the EPA, we have been issued a construction air permit for the facility and it meets the most\nSpeaker 11: rigorous standards for for air emissions that exists at at the state and at the federal level. So that was a concurrent process of permitting and a very rigorous technical review. And it also is woven into the eat up or the engineer and design operations plan.\nSpeaker 11: That's part of this certificate of designation, which really mandates how we fulfill and maintain our our permit requirements for the air emission as well.\nSpeaker 2: So how often when you all be testing the air emissions continuously? Okay. And and once it gets past a certain low level or dangerous level in which we heard a little bit, you what are you required to shut down?\nSpeaker 2: What's the.\nSpeaker 11: Well, I'll provide this caveat. We don't expect that it will ever get to dangerous levels, but the permit levels are are far below dangerous levels. If we do ever get to those permit levels through our continuous monitoring, we would have to have a shutdown, take corrective actions and resume operations.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilmember Councilwoman Rob.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. President. Some of my questions have been answered. First, I just want to establish a timeline here. So according to the question Councilwoman Ortega asked, the zoo's been handling waste at approximately this location since the seventies.\nSpeaker 11: That is correct.\nSpeaker 10: Yeah. These are probably for you, George. And when was the building approved or permitted?\nSpeaker 11: This the the main building, which is part of Toyota Elephant Passage, was approved by the Denver Building Department in fall of 2009.\nSpeaker 10: And it was completed. Am I right in remembering 2011.\nSpeaker 11: Or late summer 2011?\nSpeaker 10: Okay. And then some questions about the facility itself. Will you be handling commercial waste said is any waste generated by sources other than the Denver Zoo?\nSpeaker 11: No.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. And then in the packet of materials with all the appendices, you have an appendix, Jake. It's called Safety Material Assessment Assessment Reports on waste handling and safe operation. But when you go to that appendix, it's said it's to be completed later.\nSpeaker 10: Can you just elaborate what's going to be in there? When is it going to be completed?\nSpeaker 11: Yes. A backup.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. My name is Jennifer Hale. I'm the director of safety and sustainability for Denver Zoo. In regards to the question of when Appendix J will be completed, it was on hold. We were waiting for our air permit to be issued, which we received this afternoon, the final air permit.\nSpeaker 0: And there's very specific conditions that we have to meet with that plan. So once we got that permit signed by the state, we will be working on this final plan and me submitting it to DHS and CDP.\nSpeaker 10: So that's not required before you get the certificate?\nSpeaker 0: It is not. No, it is part of an addition as part of a requirement, as George had mentioned, the merging of both the air permit and the eat up conditions.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. And then my final question. What is the general timeline moving forward? When do you expect to be in operation?\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. So we'll after approval of a certificate of designation, then we would start to move equipment into the Waste Management Building over the course of early 2015, starting to put those pieces in place and starting operations sometime in the end of the first quarter of that year.\nSpeaker 11: As we move forward in installing the many pieces of equipment that that fill out the system and hopefully would come into operation towards the end of 2015.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilwoman Rob. Councilwoman, can each.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Question for the Department of Environmental Health. So I was cross-referencing things folks were talking about with the materials in the packet just in case folks wondered what we do on these computers. There's only one thing we do, which is look at materials.\nSpeaker 0: I found the section referenced by someone who said, you know, trade secrets in terms of the gasification process. So I just want to be clear, aware of the exact chemicals and processes involved. And you review those exact processes and chemicals in making your recommendation regardless of what is or is not in the public documents.\nSpeaker 0: We have a list of chemicals that would be on site that's within the up. And so we have looked at that. We have looked at how their operations could be managed to be protective of human health and the environment.\nSpeaker 0: We do not know the exact process steps, but we don't believe we need to know the process steps in order to be protective of the material that they're going to be handling on the site. Okay. So I just want to say that back to you to make sure I understand it.\nSpeaker 0: So we are thinking more about the site itself in terms of the safety of, you know, the chemical interactions if spills, things like that. When you listed the conditions that local government is responsible for reviewing, you did not specifically I don't think mentioned air quality analysis.\nSpeaker 0: Is that the state's responsibility legally to be focused on the exact emissions? I just want to clarify roles and responsibilities between the city and the state in that they will monitor the air to specific. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Pardon for interrupting. I don't mean what the zoo's responsible for. I meant in reviewing and issuing permits. What is our responsibility as a city versus the state's responsibility in regard to saying, yes, this is a process or this is an air emission that would be acceptable?\nSpeaker 0: This is not this is dangerous. This is not so what are our responsibilities? Okay. The city does not issue a permit. We will audit their their work to make sure that they're in compliance with the permit. Got it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. That is the state's responsibility. Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilwoman County Councilwoman Shepherd.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is for George George Pond. You mentioned that a. Part of the waste that is currently generated at the zoo is is being hauled to the landfill. How many tonnes is that annually?\nSpeaker 11: It's \u00a31.5 million annually goes to landfill.\nSpeaker 7: \u00a31.5 million is going to our landfill. Okay. That's my question for you, Kate. A question for Shannon. I think I heard you say that 700,000 had already been spent on beautification. Was that specific to the what we're calling, I guess, the back end of the.\nSpeaker 9: Zoo, south side of the zoo, right?\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. And I also heard you make say that you've already made a commitment to earmark funds for beautification in your next budget cycle. That's correct. And approximately how much?\nSpeaker 9: Well, I have a board meeting tomorrow, so the Finance Committee approved it, but the board has to approve it, and I'm sure they will, but I don't want to get out of order. But it'll be a signal of significant funds.\nSpeaker 7: And I'm imagining a significant piece of that is for the South.\nSpeaker 8: Side. Correct.\nSpeaker 9: That's what I mean.\nSpeaker 7: That was my question for you. My third question, I think might be for Councilman Brooks. Perhaps there's been a lot of talk about the neighborhood advisory committee. And am I understanding correctly that you have committed to this group?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, you know, and I share about that in my comments. But City park friends and neighbors and Councilwoman Mira Sussman came on over. We had a conversation about this a couple of weeks ago, but it was more about the larger master plan of City Park and how we move forward and how we work together with all the\nSpeaker 2: facilities and how those facilities, the Museum of Nature and Science, the zoo, the park talked to neighbors about their plans. And, and and so anyway, I share about that. But in 1997, there was a task force that mayor, Mayor Webb, put together around kind of master planning the park.\nSpeaker 2: And it had folks from the neighborhood have folks from the zoo, had folks from museum interested in science. And I think something like that needs to be created. And then Councilwoman Robb talked about Botanic Gardens and the oversight committee that works with them and how, you know, it's not always a seamless process, but it's effective, right?\nSpeaker 2: Everyone feels informed. And so we need something like that to be established again here in City Park.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. So I'm hearing a pretty firm commitment there. And then I guess my final question is how how long has the zoo itself been in this location and operating?\nSpeaker 11: 118 years.\nSpeaker 7: You know, I think it's really interesting to point. I mean, we've talked a lot about the historic nature of the park itself, but the zoo itself is also historic in this location. Thank you. Those are all my questions.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilwoman Shepard. Councilwoman Monteiro.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. I had a question. There's a lot of conversation about what the state regulates and what the city doesn't regulate. I wanted to ask a question. Is there anywhere through the process where the Denver Fire Department was involved?\nSpeaker 8: And did they what you know, what did they say? Because if there was ever any unfortunate incident, who would be the first responders? I think it would be the Denver Fire Department.\nSpeaker 11: Well, certainly the Denver Fire Department would would respond to any any issues. But there's two ways they've interfaced with the designs. One is during 2009, when the plans were being reviewed, the Denver Fire Department, among the other buildings in the Toyota Urban Passage area, reviewed that and made comments.\nSpeaker 11: And and we complied with all of those comments moving forward. The building department will be involved as specific pieces of equipment get get moved in. Some of which need permitting, building, permit type things. And they they would get involved as well.\nSpeaker 11: But part of our eat up or our engineer design operating plan absolutely addresses risk management at multiple levels from an operations stand to health and human safety, but also for fire.\nSpeaker 8: I just want to be clear. The last time the Denver Fire Department weighed in was in 2009.\nSpeaker 11: We've been in communication to them since then. So I wouldn't say it's the last time that they weighed in necessarily, but their formal action of reviewing the building, its type and occupancy and fire rating was in 2009.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Thank you. I'm still uncomfortable with your answer. What does that mean, that they weighed in?\nSpeaker 11: Well, they actually they were part of the permit approval process at that time. So they so they approved the the the occupancy rating use, as well as the fire suppression system in 2009?\nSpeaker 8: That's correct. Okay. So and then I just have one more question. So is there a response plan for the concerns that the neighborhood people have talked about?\nSpeaker 11: Well, if I could, I'll broaden that. Yes, there is a response plan for safety. There's a response plan for noise, noise and order odor. If if that's what you're asking. So the EDA specifically calls out criteria for how to handle noise, odor and safety issues, as well as how complaints will be taken addressed.\nSpeaker 11: What's the timeframe in which those can be addressed and how we produce a corrective action plan? And who are the the reviewing agencies who will confirm that things have been handled?\nSpeaker 8: I have one more question. So how will and maybe Councilman Brooks is going to answer this, but how will the neighborhood people know what the response plan is under any situation? Have they been briefed on what that would be?\nSpeaker 11: Well, it is it is part of our plan. So there is a very specific flowchart of communication and in it. So it is part of the documents that are that are being considered here. And so it will be published.\nSpeaker 11: But certainly we will continue our communication, among other things, to make sure that we're communicating how those how concerns and responses can be handled. So we will take responsibility for that.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilman Montero, Councilwoman Fox.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the gentleman who talked about talking with council and other community groups from the zoo. I do remember you're coming to talk to me. And I felt as if this really seemed to be an environmentally sustainable move.\nSpeaker 8: I was very impressed by your presentation. You say you went to other groups too, and they were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. I guess I don't mean this as a rhetorical question. We have had a whole string of people who are not in support.\nSpeaker 8: Where is the evidence of this overwhelming support so that we can know that that the some communities really are embracing this?\nSpeaker 11: Sure. During that public outreach period, we did host a number of open houses and we did have a guest list sign in there. And we did receive comments via email and also written comments at that time. That was some of the overwhelming support that we had heard.\nSpeaker 11: Also, in sharing this with some of the people that we consulted with, that would be the National Board in the Renewable Energy Laboratory. And some of our other scientists peers are very supportive of this technology and using this kind of process.\nSpeaker 11: We did send out public notice to all the registered neighborhood organizations and as I said, held several information meetings, received comment, and some of the comments were related to where is this going to be? Is it going to smell?\nSpeaker 11: How are your operations going to minimize no noise and odor? And as my colleague George Pon stated, embedded within the EDA are the criteria that we must abide by. And those have been rigorously vetted by people who are professionals in this field.\nSpeaker 11: We also have an action flow chart for if there is concerns. The reason why I stated overwhelming support is because we heard virtually and I will stand by this virtually zero negative comments during our exhaustive outreach that started in 2009 and was very, very exhaustive in 2013.\nSpeaker 11: We heard literally zero negative comments about it. Also, as part of the review period for the heat up, there are public notices that are put out there as they pertain to the different permits that we received from the city and state.\nSpeaker 11: Those public comment periods received virtually zero comments. I believe there was one comment made during the state air permit period and that was again from this new group, City Park Friends and neighbors who we've just been recently hearing from.\nSpeaker 8: If I may, Mr. President, I just want I know that you all are new, but sometimes it really helps when you know that there's some concern to have some balance in the presentation and then the people speaking.\nSpeaker 11: Thank absolutely. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilwoman Fot Council Members Robin Monteiro Okay. If I go to Councilman Sussman, who had had the opportunity. Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. President. I just want Andrew I just want to ask you, you also went to ANC Park Committee, which is a subcommittee of ANC. I just wanted to elaborate on Councilwoman Foster's question and how did they respond to the presentation?\nSpeaker 11: Yes, we were asked to present. Actually, we approached them during this period and we presented to the committee during that during that presentation, they were supportive. And they did move a month after that presentation to vote in support of the process.\nSpeaker 11: I know you guys have received some emails saying that they were not duly informed up to that point. As I said, the presentation that was made during the Infrastructure and Culture Committee was very similar to what was made to Ing Park as well.\nSpeaker 11: So we did feel pretty good about their support. Another part of the public process was presenting to the Parks and Rec Advisory Board. We did present the plans in a public forum there. There was a public comment period during one of those meetings.\nSpeaker 11: Nobody spoke in opposition and they voted in unanimous support of moving forward with the waste energy process. Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. All right, Councilwoman Robb.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. President. In still continuing during this meeting to go through the materials in front of me. I had to ask previously, without seeing this attachment about whether you are you expected to accept waste from any other source.\nSpeaker 10: And all of a sudden I found a draft waste acceptance plan in the packet. I don't think it's actually labeled as a separate appendix or I got the appendix numbers mixed up, but it does very clearly say in the first sentence at this time the zoo is not approved to accept any waste streams, but it goes on\nSpeaker 10: other than from other sources. But it goes on to say at some time, or at least to imply at some time in the future, you might do that. My concern is I want to be very clear what I'm approving tonight.\nSpeaker 10: What would be the. Procedure if you decided in the future you wanted to do that, because until tonight, I didn't understand that that could possibly be part of the plan. And I think that's a very different thing than talking about the operation and maintenance of a zoo, which is definitely a park use.\nSpeaker 11: Absolutely. And I and I'll make one clarification. Your earlier question was somewhat specific about commercial waste, but I'll answer so absolutely no. On commercial waste, we are we will take parkways. So tree branches and things like that. As a as a part of it, we do not have the discretion to add any outside waste into this.\nSpeaker 11: So this is really the discretion of the Parks Department and I believe the Department of Environmental Health also, in order to to change that, we don't anticipate at this point it's not but it's not our discretion to do that.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. So I want to know from someone in the city, what is the process if indeed it's some of these things previously acceptable? You've got cardboard cloth landscape away. What's the process to to accept other materials?\nSpeaker 0: If the zoo wanted to accept other materials, they would have to go to D.H. and also go to the CDP, Colorado Department of Environmental Health, and tell us what they're going to do, what they plan on accepting how that would fit into their program, the type of waste, subsequent waste that could be generated, whether it would just\nSpeaker 0: be a solid waste, what would it be a hazardous waste? We would we would ask a lot of questions to understand exactly what they would be bringing in, how it would be managed, and what the byproducts would be.\nSpeaker 10: Would they have to come back to council?\nSpeaker 0: I'll leave that to legal. Good evening, Jessica Brody, Denver City Attorney's Office. The municipal code doesn't specifically speak to that question, but I will say that council does have discretion at any time to withdraw the approval of their certificate of designation.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilwoman Robert. Councilman Monteiro.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. Is there a representative from the Francis City Park that I could ask a question to? Can you please come up to the podium? So I have two questions. Number one is the Friends of City Park, a registered neighborhood group.\nSpeaker 3: I'm sorry. I can hardly hear you.\nSpeaker 8: Is Friends of City Park a registered neighborhood group?\nSpeaker 4: Are you registered neighborhood organization?\nSpeaker 8: Yes. So in 2009, did you or did you not receive this information?\nSpeaker 3: We were not in existence in 2009.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then the other thing that I wanted to ask is the request for. You were talking about a group similar to Botanic Gardens. I'm not sure what that is, but what is it that what is it that you want accomplished or discussed if such a group would be organized?\nSpeaker 3: I'll answer that if you haven't guessed. I'm from New York originally, and I'm here in Denver now in about four years. I've heard ever since I've come to Denver that we're trying to be a world class city. I would ask you, do you think in Central Park where they have a zoo, that if they put up a\nSpeaker 3: facility, as you had pictures of, that people would stand around and applaud it? Sure. It sounds great when you're going to turn waste into energy. I mean, who would be against that? The question is, what's involved? Where is it?\nSpeaker 3: And it just doesn't seem right for Denver and for it's beautiful city park. Everybody that I know that comes to see me from wherever they are, I take them to the park with pride. I show them all the beautiful views and everything, and then they say, What's this thing over here?\nSpeaker 3: If indeed the zoo was going to present this thing in a very favorable light, they probably should have built a structure that everybody could say, This is lovely. Yeah. I mean, it's great. And the technology sounds good, but what is the technology?\nSpeaker 3: Somehow it's shrouded in certain secrets that we don't really know. We have a lot of people that that understand these things a lot better than I do. And they would certainly look into it and put their input towards it as well so that everybody could feel good about this and everybody could be proud of it.\nSpeaker 3: But I can't tell you that I'm proud of it. And I don't know anybody that is, except maybe the people that are trying to make it happen.\nSpeaker 8: So I'll just be blunt. So the idea of establishing a committee to work with the zoo is to. To kill the project.\nSpeaker 3: We would love to have communications with them on a regular basis. We are, you know, we're neighbors. We love the park. We love the zoo. We love everything about it. But we sometimes feel very excluded from the process.\nSpeaker 3: And whenever there seems to be something that the zoo wants, they come here or wherever they go, and they seem to get it accomplished. And we never have a say about it.\nSpeaker 8: So as a registered neighborhood group, you're not receiving information?\nSpeaker 3: Well, we we are now, but we haven't received any of this. As I said, we're relatively new. And when this all got started, we were not in existence. We came about, if you recall, from City Loop, which was a project that was also tried to put upon us and we know what happened.\nSpeaker 8: Well, thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Anybody else?\nSpeaker 4: No, thank you, sir. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: And thank all of you for listening. I appreciate.\nSpeaker 4: It. Councilwoman Robb.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. President. I think David Broadwell could expand further on my earlier question. And I would like to hear from David on on what it would, you know, whether we're approving future acceptance of waste from other customers.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. Councilwoman David Broadwell, Assistant City Attorney. I thought I'd shed a little additional light on your very, very important questions. The and particularly calling up the language you were quoting a moment ago, a linchpin to the legality of this waste to energy facility in this location in a city park.\nSpeaker 11: Is that it only be processing parkways. It's legal because it is an integral part of the zoo itself. And I think one of the speakers alluded to it a minute ago. To the extent there's been talk of anything else going through this waste to energy facility, it may be other parkways.\nSpeaker 11: So it still passes muster as a legitimate park use in a park, but it can't be processing third party waste from other locations unrelated to the parks. And I think the conversation around this is is there's some interesting there's different layers of this here, certainly, and certainly the environmental health part of it.\nSpeaker 11: And the process of the certificate, you're you're you're considering here tonight, we always know with all things in parks, there's an underlying principle about how parks can only contain park uses under the charter. And this certainly passes muster legally because it is integral to the operation of the zoo.\nSpeaker 11: And the zoo is certainly a legitimate park use. But we attorneys will advise down the road if we have to, that it can't become a third party receptacle receptacle for third party waste from from other completely other locations and other purposes as a matter of our charter.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. That's very helpful.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. All right. Any other questions? Are they? The public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, Councilman Brooks.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. President. This is this has been a rather robust conversation. And for me, this conversation has been going on for about a year and a half off and on. I first want to address city park friends and neighbors.\nSpeaker 2: We we had a really good meeting a couple of weeks ago. And Mary Beth Sussman does not serve as the councilperson person over the park, but she was there. She came to be a part of this meeting. And so I really appreciate you being there as well.\nSpeaker 2: And you don't hear council people saying this a lot, but I learned a lot. I learned a lot from my neighbors. And I heard a lot of their concerns. And it was a first meeting. And I think you heard a little bit.\nSpeaker 2: We the first time this group came together was to fight the city park loop kind of conversation, which is now in Councilman Lopez's district. Congratulations. And and so it started with it started with a bit of friction. But I have to say, you know, these neighbors are incredibly passionate and incredibly intelligent about the things going on in\nSpeaker 2: the park. And so I learned a ton. I think, you know, unfortunately, this conversation is getting turned just a little bit because the vision and the skill of our conversation was about the entire park. And how do we stop thinking in silos in City Park, at the Museum of Nature and Science has their projects and the zoo\nSpeaker 2: has their projects and parks and Rex thinks about their projects and City Park. But how do we think about it? Holistically is what we were coming to. And and they have this group and many neighbors have felt kind of pushed to the side out of conversations.\nSpeaker 2: And I certainly can appreciate that. And so that's when we talked about this advisory group and this task force that would have representatives from every party, not just one group in a silo, but every group, the zoo, the museum and nature and science, parks and rec, and members of the community to talk about and vet issues like\nSpeaker 2: we're talking about today. I don't think or at least that night, the issue was not about gasification. The issue was about all of the decisions that led up to neighbors being pushed to the side and not being considered.\nSpeaker 2: In this conversation, I got to say, I agree on every development that that I'm a part of downtown. And we talk about a building or a facility having a back. Right. Like the facility has to worry about not having a back side either.\nSpeaker 2: We're just talking about this with the St Joseph's Hospital, that they don't put their backside in the neighborhood and the zoo. The neighbors feel like the zoo kind of has their backside in the park. And if you go into the park, you you kind of see that.\nSpeaker 2: And and that's that's a design element that we should have talked about we should have considered when designing that. So I am proposing that we put together this neighborhood advisory group or this task force mirrored similarly to Botanic Gardens and what they have.\nSpeaker 2: And Councilman Robb brought that up and also Lord Dennis Miller, executive director of Parks and Rec. And and it will be you know, we will work with the neighbors, will work with all the the major stakeholders to kind of put this together.\nSpeaker 2: But but I have to say that I feel like this gasification process is sort of a separate issue. And, you know, I have received calls to delay this this issue and so that this organization and this group can convene first and then make a decision on the gasification process.\nSpeaker 2: But my questions were answered in this and I think David Braswell and we talked today, talked about these are just park issues, right? This is not going to be a commercial facility. I think a lot of phone calls and emails that I received today is was worried about this being this this kind of solid waste facility in\nSpeaker 2: the middle of of the park. And that's not what we're looking at at all. I want to I want to put people's attention to \u00a31.5 million of waste that gets trucked out of City Park into a wasteland that, you know, we don't really see a lot in Denver, but a lot of folks who live close to it\nSpeaker 2: , this this feels like an opportunity for the city. It feels like an opportunity for many of the organizations in our city to start thinking about zero waste. And so I will be supporting this. I will be supporting this with an astronaut.\nSpeaker 2: And the asterisk is that we as a community kind of come together and begin figuring out what this what do developments, what do initiatives in the future look like? Do we have a process for it? Because we don't have a process currently and we need to develop one.\nSpeaker 2: And my encouragement to the zoo is you do have neighbors. We do have neighbors, and we have to engage them. And there needs to be regular check ins with the neighborhood on how this process is going, even if it's quarterly of Hey Here, the here are the readings that we have from our facility.\nSpeaker 2: This is how much we have been using that. What do you guys think about this and getting folks, engaging folks into that? So I'll be supporting this, but I will also be supporting much more community engagement in a task force going forward.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Shepherd.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Council President Herndon, I will not be here next week for second reading. So I really wanted to make my comments tonight and I really want to thank my I think my colleague, Councilman Brooks, really touched on a lot of the key issues and did a great job.\nSpeaker 7: But I think we've all learned a lot through this process in especially on on what Councilman Brooks talked about is like the back of things and how often that topic comes up in conversation. I mean, sort of rhetorically, there's a rhetorical question.\nSpeaker 7: I mean, everything has a back, doesn't it? Or does it or should it or what should it look like or, you know, where should it face? I think that's a really big question that we should talk about a whole lot more comprehensively as we launch into the to the redo of our blueprint, Denver, which is our land\nSpeaker 7: use and transportation plan, which process will start in 2015. So there's an opportunity to address this question in a in a more holistic and comprehensive way. Secondly, I know that the zoo has learned a lot from this process.\nSpeaker 7: You know, and I know these are good people I'm looking at. You know, I'm looking at them. I've known George Pond for quite a while now. I know that they have heard you. And that they are committed to working with you, to really finding ways to help beautify that back side of the park, to make it a\nSpeaker 7: better transition or boundary between the two. I, you know, I believe them. I can see them nodding vigorously. And I know that they're going to work together with you in this coming year. And I think there'll be a lot of opportunity for public input about what that looks like.\nSpeaker 7: And I believe you have the support of everyone on council as well around that. Thirdly, I mean, you know, I've heard great commitment on the part of Councilman Brooks to forming that neighborhood advisory committee. He just outlined, you know, all of the issues that they want to tackle, not just in relation to the zoo, but at the\nSpeaker 7: Museum of Nature and Science. And I trust that that process is going to move forward and move forward in a good way. Fourth, I just also want to touch on the issue of waste. There's a lot of goals that we are trying to accomplish here.\nSpeaker 7: I sit on the Sustainability Advisory Council, as does my colleague, Councilwoman Peggy Lehman, and we just completed our 2020. And by the way, so does George Pond. And there's I commend him for serving on that committee, because it's mostly partners that are directly here in the city from the city departments that are on that.\nSpeaker 7: So he sits on that as a as a partner who isn't actually from the city. The 2020 goals in the waste category are this specifically to reduce waste disposed of by the city through its operations, through delivery to a landfill by 30% in 22 in 2020 over the 2012 baseline.\nSpeaker 7: Secondly, the community goal, the broader community goal is to reduce waste disposed of by delivery to a landfill by 20% over our 2012 baseline. So the reduction of \u00a31.5 million not going to that landfill is very significant. Not only that, this is a cutting edge, proprietary process that not only the zoo is going to use and in\nSpeaker 7: , you know, continue its goal of being net zero eventually and the greenest zoo of America. But that can be replicated in many institutions across this whole country and hopefully our own city here shortly as well. So I think, you know, it's going to be an exemplary, amazing experience that we're about to experiment, that we're about to go\nSpeaker 7: on, that we can all think, you know, deeply about about how we're going to reduce our waste and filling up our landfills very quickly. I just want to say, lest anyone is misled, Miss Lori Dana miller, our director of Parks and Recreation, is a city and county of Denver.\nSpeaker 7: RESIDENT. She is my constituent. She lives across the street from an equally historic park in the city and county of Denver. So she is deeply committed to how the public interfaces with our parks and what that experience is like.\nSpeaker 7: And she's been active on those issues, not just as the director, but also as a citizen. So I just want to put that out there, lest anyone might think otherwise. But finally, I asked this question because I wanted to make sure the zoo has been there for 118 years.\nSpeaker 7: It's not just a historic park. It's a historic zoo that receives millions of visitors every year who treasure it. And it teaches us and educates us all, you know, from cradle to grave, about our world, about all the species who inhabit this world and how we have to care not only for them, but for their habitat, not\nSpeaker 7: just for our own survival, but for theirs as well. So in my mind, they're kind of married at this point, right? So, you know, just like any long term marriage, it's not always perfect. There are a lot of strengths.\nSpeaker 7: And then there's always opportunities for growth, always opportunities to grow and improve. I you know, I just want to make sure that this discourse doesn't devalue the important, significant contribution that the zoo has made in conservation and education to the city and county of Denver and into the region.\nSpeaker 7: So I really hope, you know that we're not having a conversation about two different entities because they share and cohabit the same space and they have for over 100 years. We can do things better. I hear commitment from Councilman Brooks, and I know you're going to hear commitment from many other members of this council that we can\nSpeaker 7: always do it better and we are all going to hold each other accountable in that process. So I am voting yes to move this forward tonight, and I do thank you because I have learned a lot from this conversation.\nSpeaker 7: So I thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilwoman Shepherd. Councilwoman Lemon.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. I hardly can add anything to what my fellow council people say. So I just.\nSpeaker 0: Want to say.\nSpeaker 8: That this has been a long term thing that we have all been aware.\nSpeaker 9: Of and.\nSpeaker 8: Worked with. And it has come to this point, which is a pretty exciting point, and we will continue to work with and come to it. There have been many, many. We know that the zoo is committed to public outreach.\nSpeaker 8: They from 29 to 2013, they went they have done a lot of public outreach on this so that we all share the same values. Where I am glad that there is a new group that really wants to be involved and I welcome their involvement and I think I'm going to vote yes for this and just look forward\nSpeaker 8: to the next steps. So thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilwoman Lemon. Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to I am going to vote for this. I did. I do see the benefit to this new technology. I do see the benefit for the conversion and the fact that it doesn't smell.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, I know a lot of places whose. Well, never mind. But let's just say I know that smell and I wish we had an ordinance on that. But but I think this is going this is a very good idea.\nSpeaker 3: I think it's brilliant. And it makes me want elephants in my neighborhood so that we can go on, get off the grid. You know what I'm saying? No, it's not flying oak. Oh, you know, in all seriousness, I do understand the residents concerns.\nSpeaker 3: I do see that when you look at the building, you look at the backside is not pretty and it doesn't match with the neighborhood. But, you know, when you when you see that, when you see that side, it begs to see art, our mural ism, something that ties the zoo to the park.\nSpeaker 3: I could I can I can imagine so many. I actually have a guy who did our Barnum mural. His his name is feud it was Chris go by Knox in Alameda and look at the mural he did it is amazing and it ties in the circus because of Barnum and P.T. Barnum and all that history we have\nSpeaker 3: in the neighborhood. But could you imagine something like that on that facade? It ties right into city park. Could you imagine a mixed media? I mean, I'm not talking about my favorite horse at dinner. I love that guy, but I kind of am.\nSpeaker 3: There's something that we can do to make that better. And I think there's something I mean, it's more than just that, how it looks and the facade. Right. It's it's looking at the zoo as a park as well.\nSpeaker 3: It is. It's timeless. It's 118 years old. It's that 57 Chevy that just a little bit of a little bit of turtle wax. I'm sorry, folks. Amphibian folks. Are they here? No. Reptile, reptile with a little bit of it.\nSpeaker 3: You make it shine. And it's a classic and it's an instant classic. And that's what the zoo is. That's what city park is. And one wouldn't be without the other. City park wouldn't be what it is without the zoo, to be quite honest.\nSpeaker 3: It wouldn't the zoo wouldn't be what it is without City Park. And I think it's I think it's imperative that there is communication, there is some ongoing communication, that there is some coordination. Denver is a growing metropolitan city.\nSpeaker 3: We should act like it. And these two uses meet perfectly. It's just a matter if. It's. If it's a. It's a visual thing. Let's get it done. There's a lot of walls in our district. I did not add to the property value in our neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 3: We put art on them. Next thing you know, everybody wants to live next to the mural. There it is. So with that, I mean, I'm I'm supportive I'm supportive of these permit. I do hear you out City Park and I think the further communication and coordination is going to be super beneficial.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Robb.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the people who came to testify. And I want to thank the zoo. The zoo. You did do a lot of outreach. I know you care about the community, people who are opposing this.\nSpeaker 10: You did a very good job of making yourself heard in being sure that we did our homework, really knew what we were approving, because I believe this is a very serious consideration. And I looked at the criteria that we have to approve by, and I think they have been satisfied.\nSpeaker 10: The effect on the surrounding area was probably the greatest one to think about. But I have to say, going through this process, it's listening process. I'm puzzled on two counts. The first thing that puzzles me is that last September 2013, the zoo mailed to 65,000 people on their mailing list.\nSpeaker 10: So granted, probably zoo members, some in the neighborhood, some outside notified the R.A. had 65 people, which is pretty good attendance for a public meeting at a public meeting. And then in October, Prep had an informational item. Their agendas are public.\nSpeaker 10: Especially the park advocates in this city. Watch that. On November 14th, there was a public hearing. No one spoke. The building then was completed in 2011. And although I don't represent the area, I did chair what was known as Ludy and Parks came under that I never since 2011 heard anything that drew my attention to the south\nSpeaker 10: side of the zoo where my attention should have been drawn. I will say, and I understand that friends and neighbors of city parks, the new group, and I think they have legitimate concerns about the south side of the zoo.\nSpeaker 10: And that brings me to the second puzzling item of this. We have a 4700 square foot building there that was built in there, was planned in 2009, built in 2011. And yet the back of the south side of the zoo really looks incomplete in its cheek two and a half years later.\nSpeaker 10: So the frustration mounts. Now, let me just say this. One thing I've learned in public office is you never get an A in process. I'm not sure neighborhoods get a day at council, certainly doesn't get an A. It's a very hard thing to do well.\nSpeaker 10: So that brings me to I really applaud Councilman Burke's approach. I was fascinated to compare the cooperative agreement between the zoo and the city with the cooperative agreement of the Botanic Gardens in the city. Since I represent the area where the Botanic Gardens is and that agreement with the Botanic Gardens was done before I was in office\nSpeaker 10: . But we've had our share of controversy at the Botanic Gardens, too, about buildings, but it requires it has teeth, it requires a neighborhood advisory group, requires neighborhood trustees, it requires notification of that group. The groups are official. So if you don't get the message, you you follow down.\nSpeaker 10: If you don't speak when it's time to speak, you've fallen down. So I really do hope there may be a better approach in City Park. It's not one size fits all, but I really do hope that the process goes quickly.\nSpeaker 10: I considered the delay and was still considering it during this meeting, but I will say I think it took four years to do this amendment.\nSpeaker 0: To the.\nSpeaker 10: Botanic Gardens Agreement and you guys really just need to get to work on this stakeholders group or whatever is set up. It's going to be a long discussion, but it'll be a discussion for the good. So thank you, everyone.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Monteiro.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank everybody who came out tonight, and I want you to know that through the conversation, I was very uncomfortable with some of the things that were being presented on part of the Denver Zoo, because I kept thinking if if this was in my council district, what would I do?\nSpeaker 8: And in retrospect, I would have I would have really and not that nobody I don't want to cast aspersions on anybody, but I just feel that somewhere along the line, the communication sort of did fall by the wayside.\nSpeaker 8: And for that I feel uncomfortable and that I was a little bit confused too, about the neighborhood concerns. People have been talking about the backside and, you know, and and to me, that's a I mean, that's an easy remedy if people come together and they want to make for a better design.\nSpeaker 8: I didn't hear too much in terms of fears around if the unforeseen should happen. That's why I was asking the questions about the Denver Fire Department and what a response plan was for neighbors and even people utilizing the zoo.\nSpeaker 8: So that I didn't feel 100% confident about that. But I do feel 100% confident about confident about is that Councilman Brooks has. Has made the commitment and so has the zoo. And so has. Right now the Friends of City Park to come back to the table and start addressing some of the concerns and fears that people and\nSpeaker 8: and maybe even participants will have. Those didn't come through very, very clearly. It was mostly about what we don't want. And being able to have a group come together and talk with one another, hopefully will move the needle on what we do want and how we want to communicate with the zoo.\nSpeaker 8: I have a tendency I love the zoo, but I also have a tendency to understand that the zoo is. A neighbor. And there's always that constant. Tension. About how can we become better neighbors? And so my hope is, is this moves forward that it is an opportunity to bring people together and to have had substantial conversations about\nSpeaker 8: opening up the lines of communication. So I will be supporting it. I trust Councilman Brooks 100% in this particular situation and the zoo and well in any. He laughed. I was talking about this. This, this.\nSpeaker 2: Only on this one. Only.\nSpeaker 8: No, no, I wasn't. I was we're talking about this. But and also the neighborhood that everyone will come back to the people and and work this out. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilwoman Monteiro. Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. I'll try to be brief, because I think many of my comments have been made already. First of all, I want to thank all of the people who have written to my office and express their views on all sides on this issue.\nSpeaker 8: Appreciate the time. I had to sit down with the folks from the zoo to learn about this process. I think some of the concerns about air quality are real that people will need to be engaged in to monitor that because of some of the various types of chemicals that are used in the process.\nSpeaker 8: But I think by creating this community advisory committee to not only be engaged in the park as a whole, but with the work that will go on with this waste to energy process, I think is important. As a city, we have a new climate adaptation plan that the mayor rolled out this year that calls for trying to\nSpeaker 8: reduce our overall emissions. And this is one step in that direction. There are many things the city is working on and talking about to try to move us in that direction. You've got states like California that are zero emission, states that are doing incredible things with, you know, hydrogen fueling stations all up and down the coast and\nSpeaker 8: lots of other things. And we're all being asked to do our part so that we can realize that climate change is real and the impact it's having on our environment is real. The fact that we've got less water, it's going to impact our our food supply.\nSpeaker 8: So we're all going to have to be doing our part to address this issue. And so for that, I commend the work that you all are doing to move in that direction. I think this is this is going to be good for the city in terms of being, you know, one of those projects out of the chute\nSpeaker 8: , as you indicated. You know, Denver Zoo is the only zero waste facility and others will be coming in looking at Denver Zoo to see how how we did it. You know, are there other areas in the Denver metro community that can learn from this?\nSpeaker 8: I know from work that I did with Enroll participating in their energy executive program, this is something that they have been working on with private sector folks for quite some time. They actually, you know, do this process on their site out in Golden to fuel part of their operations.\nSpeaker 8: And so I think this is going to be good for the city. I think the issues with the neighborhood can be addressed through this process. And I just have to say that. The community process you went through. Have you not done that?\nSpeaker 8: This room would be full tonight and people would be screaming and hollering at us to not let this go forward, to demand that we we, you know, take additional steps. And I think the fact that and it's not to discount the input that we've had from those of you who are here that did testify.\nSpeaker 8: But I think that says a lot to the process that you were engaged in because this is an active community and had homework not been done. We would be here for another few more hours. So, again, I'll be supporting this tonight.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Brown.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. President. I see this as a win win tonight. It's a win for the neighbors because they will get a in the hand. They have tonight got a commitment from their councilman that they're going to establish a neighborhood advisory committee and the zoo is going to work with that.\nSpeaker 1: And I know councilman will ride herd on this project. And secondly, the zoo gets an innovative project. One in which we should all be proud, and we'll put Denver on the map. And that's why I'm supporting it this evening.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilman Brooks.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, thank you. You know, I want to thank Scott. I want to just mention this record. Thank Scott Gilmore for for getting me these final recommendations for the City Park Partnership Task Force that was created in 1997, which the City Park friends and neighbors came up with.\nSpeaker 2: And, you know, all things always come around because the person who's on here who who really helped drive this was Hiawatha Davis, who we talked about earlier tonight. And so we will we will attempt to work hard to recreate what he did in the city.\nSpeaker 2: And we know that he was a driver. So I'm excited to put on it. And by the way, in 1987, I was graduating from high school. But just to start out, throw that out there. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilman Brooks. All right. Any other comments on 941 C? None, Madam Secretary. Roll call.\nSpeaker 6: Brooks I brown fats. I can eat lemon. LOPEZ All right. MONTEIRO Hi.\nSpeaker 3: Nevitt Hi.\nSpeaker 6: Ortega I Rob Shepherd, I.

Public hearing for council bill 494 is open. May we have the staff report?\nSpeaker 14: Thank you. So Jeff Hurt with training, planning and development. So I'm here to present on a council action item to for Tex Amendment number four to revise the general development plan processes and standards. So I'm going to walk through what a general development plan is briefly and then get into sort of the current practice within the city\nSpeaker 14: agencies to kind of address some of the deficiencies actually we've had with GDPs. And we're looking to fix as part of this process and then get into a summary of the proposed changes and then the analysis of the TEX Amendment decision making criteria.\nSpeaker 14: Okay. So what is a GDP? So a GDP is a coordinating multi departmental process that's been in place since the 1990s to address large development sites. These are typically applicant driven projects with a final deliverable of a high level conceptual site plan that addresses oftentimes infrastructure open space, sometimes land use issues, design issues, things like that.\nSpeaker 14: But it is a high level conceptual site plan. The process does require one public meeting that's an applicant led public meeting and a planning board public hearing. And the planning board actually recommends to the Development Review Committee, which is an administrative body of the Executive Directors of planning, public works and parks.\nSpeaker 14: Um, no, city council does not see these. So there's no City Council approval required for GDP. And that's important for a number of reasons here. And so the typical process is well over a year for getting the GDP approved.\nSpeaker 14: So the current zoning code process and flowchart format and a very high level is that essentially as we get these development proposals that come to the city, there's an evaluation against a number of factors as to whether or not the GDP would be the appropriate tool to use.\nSpeaker 14: One factor is whether or not it's over ten acres, but we do have GDP's under ten acres. So there's actually a whole host of factors looking at whether or not we need sort of this enhanced coordinated infrastructure for this these large redevelopment sites.\nSpeaker 14: But if the answer is no to that question of whether or not it needs a GDP, then there's certainly the option to go into other regulatory processes site plan, subdivision, for example. But if the answer is yes, then you get into the GDP process where you're preparing that high level conceptual site plan, and then we're looking to\nSpeaker 14: sequence in and build in the rezoning and other entitlements with the GDP. I mean, each one is really different. So some of the good outcomes from these again, these have been in place for for several years now since the 1990s.\nSpeaker 14: The process does foster looking at shared solutions across different city agencies. For these large projects, you often have competing objectives, so fosters kind of that dialog across those objectives. It is through the GDP process, one of the few places in our zoning code where we get open space.\nSpeaker 14: So there is a minimum 10% set aside for open space. Talk about that and looking to carry that forward. And there also is at least an opportunity for community input on the project and awareness that development is happening in the neighborhood through this GDP process.\nSpeaker 14: So some of the problems with the GDP process at a high level are one. And I think the biggest issue we've identified through our assessment over the last couple of years, even further back, is that we've used the GDP tool both for planning and plan implementation, which has been problematic for a number of reasons.\nSpeaker 14: The GDP tool isn't really built to have a robust community dialog and engagement when you're talking about community visioning and establishing land use policy for a neighborhood with a one sort of check, the box applicant led public meeting and city council not seeing these.\nSpeaker 14: So the system isn't really set up well for planning, but we have used it for planning where there's been absence of a plan, but simultaneously we've used it as a plan implementation tool, which is more getting into the technical site planning exercise.\nSpeaker 14: So trying to do both of those things simultaneously, not particularly effective that either. And then I'll highlight some of the other issues with GDP's, which is that they either go too far or not far enough. And what I mean by that is in terms of not far enough, like I said, it doesn't have city council approval.\nSpeaker 14: It's very conceptual and high level. So it doesn't it doesn't actually have a lot of regulatory weight or teeth to it in its approval. Yet there's kind of an expectation or a perception from community members and others that it does.\nSpeaker 14: So it doesn't go far enough in the sense of giving it actual teeth to implement through subsequent development entitlements. But then it also goes too far because we're asking of the community and of the customer and of the city a lot of time and money and resources going into preparing a bunch of detailed technical studies and site\nSpeaker 14: plans with really limited assurances at the end of the day in terms of like a zoning entitlement or something like that. Again, the GDP itself doesn't have a lot of weight yet. We're. Having folks do this before they're getting those entitlements in a lot of cases.\nSpeaker 14: And then also to highlight, we are getting mixed open space outcomes from that 10%. And that's one thing we're looking to address with this tax amendment. Okay. So the current practice to address some of these issues, so this is a lot of this is processes that the city has put into place over the last several years to\nSpeaker 14: address some of these issues while we do more a holistic fix to this GDP process. One I'll highlight when we need to gain consensus on a community planning visioning process. We're not using the GDP tool anymore. We're initiating a city led process that leads to a city council adopted plan.\nSpeaker 14: So no more GDPs for planning, at least in terms of current practice. And then bullet point to when we need that technical site planning exercise for coordinated infrastructure analysis. We're not using the GDP tool for that either. We're using the infrastructure master plan tool.\nSpeaker 14: So so part of this text amendment to codify that tool. And then third, we need assurances. So that means development agreements, other tools to achieve community benefits. We're not using the GDP tool. We're using the rezoning or the subdivision tool.\nSpeaker 14: Those have more regulatory weight than the GDP does. Okay. So second of three flowcharts to warn you. So the current practice that I kind of explain there in flowchart format and a lot of this is we're looking to codify with this text amendment in terms of a best practices as these developments come in the door today, we're\nSpeaker 14: asking the one of the first questions is, does it need a rezoning? If the answer is no, we have pretty limited ability to require a process more kind of a robust process that looks at the project. So the answer is typically, if the rezoning, if there is not a rezoning needed, there's the option for an applicant to\nSpeaker 14: move into another process like a site planning process under their current zoning. And that's one of the issues we're looking to address here. But if the answer is yes that the project needs a rezoning, then there is the evaluation that's being done.\nSpeaker 14: You know, in terms of what the City Council adopted plan guidance is for the site and whether or not we need that coordinated infrastructure. And I'll highlight a couple of scenarios here. Just highlighting kind of the current best practice we're looking to codify here in cases where there is a rezoning needed and we don't have that planning\nSpeaker 14: guidance, which is a good chunk of the city, we are working with developers to see the value in doing a planning process first before we're getting into the rezoning of the site planning. So that's Loreto Heights, for example, Stadium District.\nSpeaker 14: And then in cases where they do need a rezoning, but there is a plan in place, we're already doing a lot of this in terms of our current practice of trying to sequence these things. And so this LDA tool codifies our ability to do this.\nSpeaker 14: And so the summary of the changes to the zoning code, and this is at a high level and happy to drill down on any of these topics, of course change. One is that we're replacing general development plans going forward with the large development review tool.\nSpeaker 14: So what that means is that the current GDP's on the books today so these there's 28 of them stay intact as is and can have minor deviations and amendments done to them. But for new projects going forward, they're more of a clean slate.\nSpeaker 14: We would not use the GDP tool for those. We would use the LDR tool or the infrastructure master plan tool depending on the scenario. But so topic two or change two, and this is really the big difference between the LDR and the GDP, that the LDR process is more a it is a process framework as opposed to\nSpeaker 14: the GDP, which is a process and a set of plans. So the elders, a process framework that includes a menu of tools that right sizes the project to get to site development. And I'll talk in the next sort of flowchart how that would work in process.\nSpeaker 14: But essentially it's a documentation of the process going forward to tee up some of these conversations in this dialog and this coordination earlier in the process before plans are drawn up, before rezonings happen. So we have the opportunity to have these more robust conversations earlier in the process, a third to carry forward the community meeting that was\nSpeaker 14: a part of the GDP. But clarify a few things on that front. One, that it happens earlier in the process and then also to clarify the conduct of that meeting city staff and applicant roles and to have that happen actually before an application is even submitted for an LDR and then forth to better calibrate the thresholds for\nSpeaker 14: when this process was required. So lowering the threshold from ten acres under the current GDP world to five acres. But important to note, there are a whole host of other factors that are built into this bill that make it a little tighter in terms of what is when an LDR would be required.\nSpeaker 14: And we could talk a little bit about that decision making process as well. We can drill down on that and then last to codify the infrastructure master plan tool, which is a tool recurrent. Using with a number of different sites.\nSpeaker 14: But this tech summit would codify that as sort of an enhanced site planning tool. Okay. So here's the sort of flowchart. And I think it's easier to understand the the text, the movement through this lens. But essentially how this new tool would work is that once we get a large development proposal submitted, there would be an evaluation\nSpeaker 14: done between city agencies. So this is a big change from the current state, whereas under the GDPR world, the CPD manager has the sole authority to decide if the GDPR is required or not. Under this new world, it would be a joint decision across parks, planning and public works.\nSpeaker 14: Looking at all those factors the size, the need for coordinated infrastructure, again, we can drill down under those factors. And so all this happens at the pre-application phase of these developments. And essentially what happens is within 30 days and this is codified within 30 days of the PRE-APPLICATION meeting, the applicant, the city informs the applicant in writing\nSpeaker 14: if LDR is required based on those factors. If the answer is no, there's the option for the applicant to move into other regulatory processes, like a site plan, for example. If the answer is yes, a lot happens in this step right here.\nSpeaker 14: But if the answer is yes, there's an interagency convening that happens built into this bill where we look at infrastructure, open space, affordable housing design, stormwater, all these things that we want to get a more sort of coordinated, holistic look and look at specific, more specific projects earlier in their development process.\nSpeaker 14: And so part of that dialog is a preliminary determination of what the scope of the large development review is going to be. So what types of infrastructure, coordination and study do we need? And the big question that's asked at this phase is whether or not there is a city council adopted plan that addresses the site.\nSpeaker 14: And there's language built in to address that. I'm happy to talk about looking at as part of this preliminary stage, again, looking at, you know, what sort of community benefits are articulated in an adopted plan that we would look to address with the site.\nSpeaker 14: What are the tools that get us there? How do we sequence these tools? So a lot that happens in here in terms of figuring out what the process is going forward. And then sort of the next step after that is having the community information meeting and then and then the application actually can't be submitted until after the\nSpeaker 14: community information meeting. And then looking at the bottom of this flowchart here, just highlighting a couple scenarios of what the outcome of this process would be. It's essentially a documentation of the process going forward and the major asks from the city and the sequencing of entitlements.\nSpeaker 14: So it's not a tool we currently have today to kind of frontload the coordination. But the idea is, you know, some looking at, for example, one of the one of the most challenging scenarios would be when we have laser pointer here, when we have a situation where there's no adopted plan guidance addressing the site, a rezoning is\nSpeaker 14: needed. A scenario could be that the outcome of this LDR process is a documentation of what that planning process needs to be first before going into rezoning and site planning. This is what's happening again with Loretto Heights and Stadium District.\nSpeaker 14: And so this would codify the ability to have that structure. And we'll go to the other scenarios. But it's really about the sequencing and the process going forward, not about what the zoning should be or what the standards are, but just figuring out what the process is going forward.\nSpeaker 14: So getting into the open space changes. So like I said, we are carrying forward the current 10% minimum open space requirements from the GDP, but we are enhancing what qualifies to better address what's publicly accessible, usable and providing a community benefit.\nSpeaker 14: So I'm happy to talk about what those design standards look like and the specifics behind that. And this is the visual to scale of of what the new requirements look like. So importantly, in a field I mentioned in the last slide, we are lowering the threshold from ten acres to meet that 10% to five acres.\nSpeaker 14: And that's what this looks like to scale in a couple of typical Denver blocks. And so I won't go through the examples scenarios in detail, but it is helpful to look at real projects and how this would have played out.\nSpeaker 14: So Loreto Heights, for example, would have been subject to this LDR process if it would have came in after this bill. And I think the outcomes would have been really similar in terms of requiring a planning process. First is City Council adopted planning process before getting into the other entitlements.\nSpeaker 14: And there was South Sloan's Lake. That's an interesting example where the outcomes may have been different. If they were to come in under this new bill. And we would have asked that question of whether or not there is clear and sufficient adopted planning guidance that addresses the site and addresses what they want to do.\nSpeaker 14: The answer probably would have been no, and that looking at the West Colfax plan, potentially needing to amend that plan before getting to site development. So the outcome would have been probably a little different with South Sloan's Lake and would have fostered that planning process a little better.\nSpeaker 14: So the process for this text amendment and we did have a GP working group that was a pretty diverse group of community members, designers, developers. We did go to ANC Zoning and planning committee twice with the proposal that's before you today.\nSpeaker 14: And we did initiate communications to affected projects starting back in March. So many, many projects were notified of this that were in the pipeline in terms of active site plans, active rezonings. We did receive three public comments on the bill.\nSpeaker 14: One, supporting this is at a high level, paraphrasing them, but support for the community information meeting and the notification behind that. And then second to support that this process has for a general deference to the city council adopted planning process as the best planning process as opposed to the GDP.\nSpeaker 14: And then lastly, concerns about using citywide policies. So Blueprint Denver specifically in lieu of small area plan policies as part of this tool and happy to talk about those comments. And so the the actual hearing process has led us to the public hearing tonight planning order to recommend approval unanimously of the bill on May 1st.\nSpeaker 14: And I will note that we have supplemental rules and regulations that accompany this bill to clarify certain things. We are working with a handful of stakeholders over the next couple of weeks and in in advance actually of planning, board, public hearing on the rules and regulations next week to clarify some some decision points within the LDR process\nSpeaker 14: to provide a little more predictability. So we are working with a handful of property owners to provide that a little more clarity through the rules and regulations of what's already in the bill. So I'll go through the criteria for text amendments.\nSpeaker 14: And this is a citywide text amendment, so only citywide policies apply in the analysis. So in terms of campaign 2040, certainly more details cited in the staff report. But there is a number of policies in the comp plan related to coordination and collaboration across city agencies to achieve greater impact or collective impact that this bill certainly supports\nSpeaker 14: . And then some policies related to enhanced public spaces that this bill also does. And so related to Blueprint Denver policies, there's actually a policy in there in support explicitly of doing this very project. So it is in support of that.\nSpeaker 14: And then also some policies related to outdoor public spaces, which this bill again fosters. Criteria to further public health, safety and welfare of staff to find the tax amendment consistent with that criteria because it will implement adopted plan policies also will improve predictability by having this more front ended coordination and communication both for the community and the\nSpeaker 14: applicant and and and for the city as well. And then lastly, improve public welfare by promoting more public open spaces. And then last, regarding a uniformity of district regulation, staff does find the TEX amendment consistent with that criteria because it would treat projects equally across the board in terms of these procedures and standards.\nSpeaker 14: So staff does recommend approval of the Tex amendment and I'm happy to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. We have five individuals signed up to speak on this item this evening. So if you can make your way up to this frontbench, I'll call you up when I say your name. Go ahead and step up to the microphone and your time will start.\nSpeaker 1: First up, Chernobyl.\nSpeaker 14: Good evening, counsel.\nSpeaker 8: My name is Joel Noble.\nSpeaker 14: I live at 2705 Stout Street.\nSpeaker 8: I'm here speaking in my individual capacity alone. I served on the GDP Working Group from 2014 on. It's taken quite a while to get to this point, but that GDP working group came about because of a lot of concern about how some GDPs were working out.\nSpeaker 8: GDP as a tool over time.\nSpeaker 14: Became kind of schizophrenic.\nSpeaker 0: Sometimes it was used as intended.\nSpeaker 1: As a infrastructure.\nSpeaker 8: Development tool. Where are the pipes going to go? Where the building is going to go, where the roads is going to go? And it was reasonable for that to be applicant led to be very technical. It was reasonable.\nSpeaker 8: But in areas where we had a large redevelopment opportunity in the city and not enough plan guidance, too often the tool was used to substitute for plan guidance where there was no blueprint. Denver of course, everywhere, but maybe nothing else.\nSpeaker 8: Or maybe the neighborhood plan wasn't terribly clear. It set up neighbors in opposition to the property owners in competing for what the vision would be rather than how we know our process is supposed to work.\nSpeaker 0: Have a city led neighborhood plan process.\nSpeaker 8: Or master plan process is happening at Loreto Heights, some adopted plan. So the large development review process fixes that. CPD did the first part of the fix some time ago by directing infrastructure work to use an infrastructure master plan, an infrastructure master plan tool that can not be confused for trying to set vision.\nSpeaker 8: And they've been doing that a lot, but it took a long time to really understand how extensive of a fix was it going to take to make what had been.\nSpeaker 0: GDP a very important idea. When we have big redevelopment spaces.\nSpeaker 8: We have to treat them with more care.\nSpeaker 14: We have to treat them with more.\nSpeaker 8: Involvement in planning.\nSpeaker 0: And we have to ask for.\nSpeaker 8: What we want, like open space, how to preserve those things. And I think they've landed in a really good place with large development review. Essentially, this is a framework, is not a new planning document, but it's a framework to stop at the beginning and say.\nSpeaker 0: Where are we?\nSpeaker 8: Where do we need to go? And what of our existing tools are going to take us there? Do you need to amend that existing plan? Do you need a new plan like Loreto Heights? Do you have all the planning guidance you need?\nSpeaker 8: You can go right to infrastructure planning, but that level setting of given where we are, what are the steps that are needed is the output of this large development review document. It's a minimal, sane, inclusive approach and I encourage your support.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next up, Jesse Paris.\nSpeaker 13: Jesse Paris represented for Denver Home a sellout black star. So moving for self defense and positive commitment for social change. And I was on top of the ballot for our lodge this past May 2019 election. Almost 15,000 votes with no money.\nSpeaker 13: We are neither for or against this. We just wanted to know exactly what this all entailed, this general development plan, because there's been multiple projects with these developments that we, the public, has not been notified all the details of these development plans.\nSpeaker 13: So I'm glad that we're getting to some kind of clarification in regards to this. I just wanted to know if this general development plan also included opportunity zones and exclusionary zones for housing. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next up, Jessica Liza de.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, members of Council. I'm Jessica Leeds today with Fairfield and Woods on behalf of Bbf Gateway, its principals John Fair, Brew Berkeley and 64th and Tower Partners LLC. My clients have been part of discussions with landowners of a large portion of the far northeast area and stand to be significantly impacted by the potential text amendments.\nSpeaker 5: I will point out that they were not specifically included in the outreach process, but I will say that we're supportive generally of the replacement of the confusing and confounding GDP process. So thank goodness for clarity. However, we are not entirely comfortable because we have not been involved with the broad nature of the language.\nSpeaker 5: We have been working over the last few days closely with staff and with legal to try and work through those concerns. And generally, I think we have gotten to a place where there's a comfort level. So but for the record, I do staff has made it clear that they as you heard from them, then they're going to\nSpeaker 5: work with some stakeholders. We would be some of those stakeholders to continue in that out the process and to provide more clarity, more definition in the areas that we're where we believe the language is broader, where it's open to too broad of an interpretation.\nSpeaker 5: However, I do want to commit those three areas to the record. The first is the broad scope of staff discretion in determining how and when the LDR process applies, and more objective criteria in the reconciliation of the proposed text and then the gateway rules.\nSpeaker 5: How does all of that work together? And the last is open space and the requirements for open space. And then how does all that work together? So lots to work out. But there is one area I would implore you that cannot be reconciled with the text as you have it in front of you, just one.\nSpeaker 5: And that is the requirement for a public easement over private open space, and that is a public easement over private land. And that works in many cases, but it does not work in one exception, and that is multi-family housing.\nSpeaker 5: And the reason for that, there are two. So there are concerns that if you have an interior courtyard or there are areas that are be counting towards open space, it does not work for affordable housing purposes. So the land use restriction agreements don't allow that.\nSpeaker 5: We also believe that there are so it would impede affordable housing and it also has Kiawah Common Interest Ownership Act implications. We ask for a simple text amendment easy fix. All you have to change is the word from ciao to May, and it would then allow us to work with staff to refine that.\nSpeaker 5: It only applies through the same rules and regulations you're asking us to follow. In the case of multi-family housing. I thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next up, David Smith.\nSpeaker 8: Hi. My name is David Smith. I live at 1770 Chestnut.\nSpeaker 0: I have worked in the real estate development community for a couple of different.\nSpeaker 8: Firms here in Denver. But I'm speaking in capacity as a private citizen. I'm in support of replacing the.\nSpeaker 14: GDP ban in a number of.\nSpeaker 8: Meetings with stakeholders, both in the business sector.\nSpeaker 14: And industry groups.\nSpeaker 0: We have the current from them.\nSpeaker 8: As a project under way. We've embraced the LDP process, we've submitted required documents.\nSpeaker 0: We're working through staff through the process. I think it's well thought out.\nSpeaker 14: It's more defined.\nSpeaker 8: It reduces uncertainty if you're on a developer in the development sector and it streamlines.\nSpeaker 14: Communication between departments.\nSpeaker 0: Stephanie An improvement over the GDP.\nSpeaker 8: We are optimistic about the process and I would encourage staff to support it.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Next up, Chairman Scoop.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Chairman Sekou likes to ask movement of self-defense. You know, I'm sitting here and I'm looking at this. And first thing popped in my mind is, what does this got to do with poor people? What's got to do with us.\nSpeaker 3: If you have these issues about open space and you've got an existing camping ban that doesn't allow poor people to occupy open space without being harassed by the residents. Was this. Meet us. And as taxpayers who spent our last dime the city sales taxes, we get none of this.\nSpeaker 3: Where's our protection in all this? That we can occupy open space without being harassed by neighbors who don't want to see poor people in that neighborhood? Who adversely call because poor people are present and then accuse them of doing dope deals or whatever.\nSpeaker 3: And then we get aroused by the police just sitting in the park. It was like, What is this? Where's our protection? That and all of this? And then you got a loophole in there. If all of this don't work, then, well, we've got other ways of going about getting this thing done through other legislative processes.\nSpeaker 3: What is that process that would allow you to get away with all of this and go outside of this? Well, you got to know the process that was on your first grade. What is that all about? How can you get out of this once you approve it?\nSpeaker 3: There's a loophole in the game. What is it? It was not explained in the process of looking at this mess. So somebody explain to me, how do you get around this in other judicial processes? And who is that to appease?\nSpeaker 3: So we could stop the charade. For real. Cause all you've got is another layer on top of another layer on top of another layer on top of another layer. That gives poor people no say so. No power whatsoever.\nSpeaker 3: To determine the outcome, because when we come to the meetings, we're outnumbered is a democratic process. And most of the notifications that you give to people coming to these meetings are never given to the service providers of the port to inform us about the meeting.\nSpeaker 3: So we looked at the look. Now tell me I'm not.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions for members of Council on this item? Council meeting each.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. Jeff, can I ask a question? So the comprehensive plan and blueprint were being discussed throughout the same time that this process was happening and have now been adopted. And so your slides talk a little bit about conformance, but the plans make many, many references to the importance of examining the equity aspects of large\nSpeaker 9: potential rezonings or upswings and thinking about displacement risks. There's a whole bunch of planned support around that and I was disappointed to see the slides really didn't make any mention of how this process thought about the equity issues and how this process might be connected to them.\nSpeaker 9: You and I have spent many meetings talking about the topic, but the slides really didn't talk about it. So I'm going to give you the opportunity to fill in the blanks a little bit about other than open space, how does this process improve our ability to look at those topics?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah, that's fair and that's an oversight. So so the process improvement addresses a number of equity policies from the current planning blueprint, mostly with regards to so you have the citywide equity policies and the neighborhood specific equity policies.\nSpeaker 14: But in terms of citywide equity policies, this process enhances our ability to tee up those conversations at the front end of the development process, more so than what we have today. So the idea behind this process is to convene all of these groups at the front end, one of which would be economic development and affordable housing folks\nSpeaker 14: , to bring them at the table, to have discussions about what sort of policies they want to look to implement, and looking at it in comparison to open space and infrastructure and balancing all those needs. So at a high level, this process was a much better job of teeing up those issues so that we can have that infused\nSpeaker 14: at the front end of the process as opposed to when it's too late in the game, you know, at a rezoning or a site planning stage. So at a high level, at the citywide level, it does that. And then the process is also designed to look at specific neighborhood planning guidance where you would hope you would have\nSpeaker 14: that more granular addressing of the equity policies on a neighborhood level. So that's related to affordable housing, but also related to local business, you know, local business issues, fostering local businesses, things like that. This process, again, tees up the ability to have those discussions earlier in the process in terms of the overall text amendment.\nSpeaker 14: And it's sort of how it lined up with blueprint and comp plan. This was well underway while that was well underway. So the expectation going forward certainly is that what we're putting in place now a more sort of robust template for analyzing each text amendment against all equity policies.\nSpeaker 14: This didn't get that level of analysis because of the timing, but you're absolutely correct that it was an oversight to not highlight that in the slides, but that at a high level is how we see this implementing equity policies by teeing up the conversation earlier, recognizing that it's going to be neighborhood specific, but at least enabling that\nSpeaker 14: conversation much better across these agencies, which doesn't really happen today necessarily.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. I want to ask if you can follow up with a little more detail on that. So there's like what the policy sets as a framework, but a lot of this depends on how things operate within the city.\nSpeaker 9: So can you talk more about the different approach that the departments are taking with regard to making sure that housing is at the table at the same time that these other departments that historically have always been at the table.\nSpeaker 9: So Parks has always been at the table, CPD has always been at the table. But can you talk specifically about how that's happening differently?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah, I mean, in some of it is is in the text, the memo, in the rules and regs in terms of who we do referrals to and all that stuff. But a lot of it is sort of institutionalizing interagency processes.\nSpeaker 14: So for example, right now we are setting up a working group of people that would meet on a recurring basis to evaluate these projects as they come in. And that group is not just Parks, Public Works and planning.\nSpeaker 14: It includes representatives from Dito on the affordable housing front and also the equity front. In terms of the NEST group, they're embedded in this as well as you just had a meeting this morning with them about community benefits agreements and so things like that, teeing up those conversations.\nSpeaker 14: So we're putting in place the staff interagency structure so that those folks are at the table on a recurring basis. And it's a regular thing where they're always at the table as opposed to just sort of leaving it to chance.\nSpeaker 14: If wherever you're sort of project case manager is to be proactive and do that kind of outreach.\nSpeaker 0: So we're.\nSpeaker 14: You know, some of us in, in the text amendment bill, a lot of it is in institutionalizing city practices that we're going to certainly share.\nSpeaker 9: Great. Can you just clarify for me made passing reference? There are some references in the text amendment and some in. The rules and regs. I read the whole text amendment. I did not read the rules and regs. So is Dito as a department.\nSpeaker 9: Obviously the name will change, so we'll have to go back and fix it. But is the Housing Department or whatever it will eventually be called, called out by name in one of the policy documents?\nSpeaker 14: Yes. Yes, it is. And the rules and regs as its current name or it's it says in parentheses or as future TV names or, you know, sort of the name can change. And so in the rules and regs, they're they're called out as a referral agency specifically.\nSpeaker 14: But in the text amendment itself, I mean, there's some language we did our best to put language in there related to our evaluation of community benefits that are achievable. So we did add that in in the last iteration of the bill.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you for being responsive to that feedback along the way.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Kennedy. Councilman Black.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 5: I have two questions. So one that Jessica brought up about.\nSpeaker 12: Open space.\nSpeaker 5: That would be a courtyard within a development.\nSpeaker 11: Will that count as open space?\nSpeaker 14: So it depends. It could. It has to be. There's a lot of language that goes with it. But if it's contiguous and accessible to a public street via a public access easement or similar mechanism, and it's fully visible from the street and there's some graphics to support that.\nSpeaker 14: So it would count if it qualifies. So so the idea of a courtyard being tucked behind, you know, an L-shaped building that you would never know exists as you're walking down the street that would not qualify or is not supposed to qualify under this bill, but something that, you know, maybe as a passageway from the street that's\nSpeaker 14: publicly accessible and has no permanent barriers, that leads to a courtyard that you could see and know that it's there. If you're a member of the public, that would count. That's the intent. And we did our best to put specific language to require that in the bill.\nSpeaker 5: And so the intent is for the public to see it and to be able to use it.\nSpeaker 14: Correct.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And then I had a question about and specifically to all GDP's.\nSpeaker 11: In my district, for example, they're both the light rail.\nSpeaker 5: Stations, and so they're in the old code. And so is there anything that would happen to trigger repealing those.\nSpeaker 11: And then.\nSpeaker 5: Creating in.\nSpeaker 11: The. Ah. So if someone wanted to rezone.\nSpeaker 5: Part of the land or all of the property.\nSpeaker 11: In the GDP. Would that trigger the.\nSpeaker 5: LDR and move us into the new code?\nSpeaker 14: So if if so, if these are old code GDPs, they can stay in the old code world in terms of the GDP. So the GDP amendment process and all the standards of the old code stay intact and stay locked in.\nSpeaker 14: It's only if they wanted to reason into the new code and it meets all the factors in terms of the size and the need for coordination and all that. Would we even flag it for whether or not an LDR would be required?\nSpeaker 14: So I mean, all I can say is that each case will be different, but we'll have systems in place where we'll flag these developments to ask the question of whether or not an LDR would benefit, you know, the customer, the city and the community.\nSpeaker 14: And so and then we look closely at those factors to see. But one trigger, though, is if they are in the new code. So if they re zone to the new code and needed to do a major amendment to the GP, that's a potential trigger to come into the LDR process as a factor.\nSpeaker 14: But nothing is really a given. There's just a whole suite of factors we would look at.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman by Councilman Ortega.\nSpeaker 10: Hi. I have a few questions as well. Can you highlight the criteria of what would throw somebody into a large development review? I know you talked about the ten acres going to five acres, but, you know, one of the speakers talked about concern for staff discretion.\nSpeaker 10: So what is the very clear cut criteria that that defines what would throw somebody into this process?\nSpeaker 14: Yes, it's a good question. So so at a high level, we we generally I know this is an answering question yet, but we carried for the GDP applicability language. So we we mirrored in a lot of ways in terms of the host of factors.\nSpeaker 14: And so those include but are not limited to changes to the arterial or collector street grid and changes to regional stormwater systems. And then some more blanket statements that the issues with the development can't be resolved through other regulatory processes.\nSpeaker 14: So there's a whole host of factors in addition to that acreage metric. What we what we did to improve on that decision making process and tightening it up from GDPs is we said instead of the CPD manager having the sole authority to make that determination, it's a joint decision of the DRC.\nSpeaker 14: That's one thing. Another thing we did to kind of tighten up that piece of it was to eliminate language where in the current GDP world that the project is phased or has multiple owners. It could be subject to a GDP, which is a really massive universe of projects, and you consider that most of them really have that\nSpeaker 14: of any scale. So those are a few examples of how we carried forward the GDP applicability language and tighten it up a bit. And there's certainly other factors in there. Like, for example, if an adopted plan calls for an LDR GDP.\nSpeaker 14: So if you have a neighborhood plan that says for this site or for this area, consider using this tool to better coordinate development and infrastructure. That could be another factor or another trigger. So I'm not setting all of them, but I think that's a good chunk of them.\nSpeaker 10: That's helpful. Can you speak to how issues like development that will be within a close proximity to railroad will be addressed as part of this new process? Looking at offsite infrastructure issues, I'm thinking about, you know, the development where we're going to have the football stadium parking lot, the Sun Valley neighborhood, 13th Avenue is a major, you\nSpeaker 10: know, arterial connector that will bring people from downtown over to that area. And I could see this one being where there's some cost sharing on improvements so that the expectation is that it's not just all, you know, general fund, public works dollars, taking care of the improvements needed.\nSpeaker 10: How would something like that fit in to the general development review process?\nSpeaker 14: So to your first question about the freight, so this process would certainly improve from the current state in terms of fostering that dialog with those stakeholders early on. So so the benefit of this process through that lens is that as opposed to the rezoning process, for example, as we are looking at a general development concept as part\nSpeaker 14: of this ADR process. So we have a sense of what's being proposed there and so that we can start to coordinate as needed if there is freight rail implications, for example, with the right stakeholders on that front to kind of get ahead of that as opposed to waiting maybe too late in the game.\nSpeaker 14: So I guess that's the quick answer to the first question. The second question is, I think also to emphasize that we're we're making an improvement over the current process in terms of our ability to coordinate across large sites for infrastructure analysis.\nSpeaker 14: And so you're referring to the Stadium District area. We're actually starting the LDR process or some version of it depending on, you know, obviously the bill tonight to address that site for those very reasons, which is the need to to look at infrastructure on a bigger scale, you know, and to get a sense of what the overall\nSpeaker 14: development concept will be in the overall development program so that we can calibrate the infrastructure better within that development area and including potentially adjacent areas and integrating with those like river miles and things like that. So I guess at a high level for for for kind of both questions, it's an improvement over our current process in terms\nSpeaker 14: of our ability to not in every case. I mean, it certainly has to meet all the criteria and the factors for a large development review, but all give us much more strength to be able to coordinate all of that across larger sites.\nSpeaker 10: So just to take it a step further, just looking at that area of the city that is proposed to have some pretty large scale development, we know Federal Boulevard is one of the adjacent corridors that is being proposed to have some improvements to address pedestrian safety issues.\nSpeaker 10: Potentially a whole rerouting of, you know, or upgrades at the Cloverleaf. Could this be an example of where there's some, I don't know, overlap in in as part of the large development review sort of urging partnering with CDOT, for example, or the city of Denver, who's also involved in work like that along the Federal Boulevard corridor.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah, I, I don't know specifically how that's going to play out, but I know like in that case of Stadium District that we're using this ADR process to ask that very question, which is not something we currently have today, the ability to kind of probe on that.\nSpeaker 14: So all I can say is that those discussions are actually happening on that site through the LCR process. So we've kind of already been using it to to get out some of those issues, recognizing there's parallel infrastructure issues going on through the Cloverleaf on Federal Boulevard and then also jumping across the river.\nSpeaker 14: I mean, you're looking at a site here. We're driving across the river at the stadium or at the River Mile Development. I think that this process has enabled us to look at the broader infrastructure impacts, and that includes an adjacent areas.\nSpeaker 14: I mean, it's a it's a a discussion that's going to happen with each project in terms of the level of coordination with external partners outside of, you know, the the applicant, basically. But we are having those discussions right now and that specific project.\nSpeaker 10: So with so much proposed activity that will be going on, you know, I've asked the people from CDOT what what they're doing to look at all of the development that is being proposed and how that is guiding some of the recommendations coming out of the Powell study, which I think you're familiar with.\nSpeaker 10: How how are we looking at development from our side trying to influence the PEL study, for example, with development from, you know, Alameda all the way to 20th Street with huge projects along various stops along the that corridor.\nSpeaker 14: I'm not sure I'm familiar with that study.\nSpeaker 10: This is where CEDA is looking at how they're going to address future upgrades to I-25 from Alameda to 20th Street and. You know, I've encouraged that they are talking to the CPD about all the development that is being planned, which is why I keep raising the issue about 38th and Fox, because it doesn't go far enough to\nSpeaker 10: address all that development at the far north end of the city. And so looking at that corridor as a whole, I think is really important to ensuring that we're not just creating more and more traffic congestion, which already exists pretty much, you know, sun, sunrise, sunset on that corridor.\nSpeaker 10: So how do we see us having greater input to see that to influence, you know, maybe how they might address some of those upgrades or improvements as as we're looking at these projects so that it's not all expected to just be on the city streets.\nSpeaker 10: And again, you know, I think we all want to see development that looks at how we reduce traffic demand and look at alternative modes of transportation. But we know that all this new development isn't going to happen without cars.\nSpeaker 5: Right.\nSpeaker 10: And so how we manage all of that becomes really critical to. It's just how what happens in our city and how we're trying to not overburden this particular end of town, for example, that's going to be having a huge amount of development along that I-25 corridor.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. My, my my quick response is, again, this would better enable the dialog and that coordination with those parallel efforts. So if there's as compared to the current state, you know, through the rezoning and state planning process, for example, those two tools aren't particularly well equipped to tee up those conversations in terms of looking at, Oh, there's\nSpeaker 14: an instructor study going on here, how are we going to integrate with that? Is there an opportunity here? I think the quick answer is a much better tease up that communication and that collaboration with those efforts. Okay.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. I have no further questions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega Guzman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 8: So I want to say I'm encouraged actually to hear that the LDR process is being used as you're looking at the stadium district because it affords the city the opportunity to sort of get some of those other concerns addressed that we were talking about in prior rezoning and get them mean in agreements with the city prior to\nSpeaker 8: any rezoning that was necessary, probably necessary. Likewise, my question is, I don't know if the text amendment that I have on my computer is the most recent, but if it is, I want to sort of clarify something that I'm reading here in section ten .8.1.3, the minimum amount required.\nSpeaker 8: This is a minimum of 10% of the net development area as defined by section 13.1 .6.4, a open space in large development rules of measurement. If I go to that. It says open space, you know, 13 164 open space in large development areas, a net development area.\nSpeaker 8: The required amount of open space in large developments shall be calculated as a percentage of the gross development area. It's the only place where we say that everything else seems to point towards the net development area. Is that a typo?\nSpeaker 14: So I don't have to put up the language here, but but the the regulation is for.\nSpeaker 8: Is that it says the net development area shall be the gross land area within the boundaries and then tells you how to get to the net development area. So that first statement says shall be a percentage of the gross development area.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. The in fumbling through the language here. But it should say that it's a definition of what the what the net development area is, which is basically the gross development area minus areas for roads, other infrastructure parks. So that tells you how to calculate what the net development area is that your open space is based on.\nSpeaker 14: There may be clunky wording there, but it should read.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, because to me it would be more accurate to go ahead and say the requirement required amount of open space in large amounts shall be calculated as a percentage of the net development area. The net volume and area shall be this, you know, because the gross development area has a specific definition.\nSpeaker 8: I would love it if it were to mean a percentage of the gross development area, which would be far more substantial in some cases than the net.\nSpeaker 14: But yeah, it's well, it is the I mean, it is the net area. So and I think that's a that's how we do it with the GDPs currently. So the language could always be improved, but that's the idea is for it to be the gross area, the total area minus other areas that are required to be dedicated\nSpeaker 8: . Okay. So then for the purposes of GDP, the what is the definition of open space?\nSpeaker 14: So the definite well, the the definition of open space, I guess it's not a defined term in terms of it being in Article 13. I would say the best definition, if you want to call it that, is through the design standards that are in Article ten in terms of what qualifies.\nSpeaker 14: So in order for it to meet the requirement for large development, open space, it has to meet a number of design standards related to its public accessibility, its usability and its and you know, it has to be I think it lists some examples of what can qualify as sort a courtyard or plaza natural impervious area, things like\nSpeaker 14: that. So that's probably the closest thing to a definition which is basically setting forth what qualifies.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. The reason why I ask is it's very clear on, you know, you know, frontage towards, you know, you know, access from streets, name streets and stuff like that. But seems pretty vague to me still on the material, you know.\nSpeaker 8: And so hopefully we'll we'll watch this and see how it how it gets utilized. But please, I mean, I know the intent is that this does not become streets and this does you know, we specifically prohibited that. But developers I still think there's latitude here for developers to sort of take advantage of what we're calling open space\nSpeaker 14: . Yeah, I mean, we definitely made improvements. This project was about addressing a process, I will say, and the idea of open space is certainly a hot button issue. And we made improvements, recognizing that there's also a city wide conversation that could happen for smaller developments.\nSpeaker 14: To that, we would get more into design and functionality and things like that. This these changes were intended to make improvements on precluding trying to preclude some of those bad outcomes. So like specifically saying an off street parking area doesn't count was not something in the GDPs and people were finding that loophole and doing like pavers on\nSpeaker 14: a parking lot and coming in as open space, not being able to count like a three foot long linear strip of, you know, you know, of a little bit of landscaping where we we are precluding that with this bill.\nSpeaker 14: So we're taking steps in the right direction, I think. But there's definitely a recognition that there could be definitely another turn at this and multiple turns to get at design and all of that stuff. But the hope is also that one of the things that this ADR process, you know, sort of could foster is looking at design\nSpeaker 14: standards, and design standards can address open space. So there could be an opportunity there through site specific areas, specific design standards, if that's a priority to address some of these issues about materials and things like that.\nSpeaker 8: Great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 12: Thank you for answering all these questions. A lot of this is there's so much planning ease in the in the ordinance and in the language. See if I can simplify things. If it is decided that, then LDR is needed, will an LDR always occur before a rezoning?\nSpeaker 14: Yes.\nSpeaker 12: I think that's very important to say because GDPs didn't always happen before zoning. Right. It's correct. Right. So this is a this is a major change because people would very often the public would say, well, we don't know exactly what you're going to do when you're asking us to rezone.\nSpeaker 12: So the biggest difference is that if it's decided an elder is needed, it happens before a reason. Right.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. It's I mean, there could be in some cases where it's staggered a bit or concurrent. But but the LDR is designed to say is designed to do just that to to mandate a sequence of entitlements and rezoning could be would typically follow the ALR if a rezoning is needed.\nSpeaker 12: I think that's probably one of the most important points about creating this LDR In terms of getting neighborhood input and ability to give their views. The other one is if you have a an owner of a property who's wondering if he's going to need to do an LDR and the and the decision is going to go to\nSpeaker 12: the Development Review Committee. Is do we have anywhere stated that it's in the is it a consensus of the committee? Is it a majority vote of the committee? Do we know who the voters are? That still is not as predictive as it could be.\nSpeaker 12: Do. Is there any feeling about how that process works?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. I mean, that's probably an area that's probably one example like tha you know, that we could provide a little more clarity through like rules and regs or supplemental guidelines or something as an example. But I will say to that point, the, the LDR, the outcome of the order of the all the F does require joint signatures\nSpeaker 14: of those agencies. So presumably, you know, in order for them to sign it, they will have had to be brought along through the whole process in terms of saying yes, it was applicable and have had this interagency dialog leading to that outcome.\nSpeaker 14: But the specific decision point in the language is DRC. It does not say majority or any voting system, but that's something that we could look to, to to clarify that a little more predictability for folks.\nSpeaker 12: You need every signature, so it has to be unanimous to it. Did I understand that.\nSpeaker 14: For the final.\nSpeaker 12: For the final yea. For the final LDR. That's correct. Okay. Okay. But not necessarily for deciding that it needs to now be are crimes.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. That's the way the.\nSpeaker 12: Is there a universe of criteria that could be listed? Probably not, because it's always hard to list what you can do. Or perhaps is there a universe of criteria of when it wouldn't happen? Okay. This do we have a universe in either of those instances to give a little bit more predictive this to.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. We have a pretty long universe of when it is required or we don't have the universe when it's not required. I mean, this is good. This is good food for thought for us to provide that clarity because I mean, this is you know, those are impacts on projects.\nSpeaker 14: So we want to make sure we have as much predictability as possible. So that's something we could consider.\nSpeaker 12: Okay. Sure. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, Councilman Cashman.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. President. Jeff, so to understand, the LDR process requires a single public meeting, and then obviously if it goes into a rezoning, there would be more involvement in that process itself.\nSpeaker 14: Correct.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. So one thing I'm kind of disappointed in my memory is that when I was first briefed that this LDA process was coming to replace the GDP, the two important points for me were that the 10% requirement for open space dropped from ten acres to five.\nSpeaker 2: But then there was going to be another 10% of green space. What happened to that?\nSpeaker 14: Yes. So I believe you're referring to the idea of Parkland City, Parkland dedication, which is what we shared with you, I believe, at the briefing. So, um, and correct me if I'm wrong as they go on this path here, but there's sort of two types of open space in this project or through this lens.\nSpeaker 14: There's the open space as set forth in. This bill, which is typically going to be privately owned, publicly accessible, so not a dedicated city park. What you, I think are referring to is a discussion that is still ongoing with the Parks Department and others to look at a citywide Parkland dedication requirement.\nSpeaker 14: And so the percentages and all of that haven't been fully calibrated yet. But that is still that is still in play now. And we're working through that. And there's actually an individual here from the Parks Department, if you wanted to kind of drill down on what that project looks like currently.\nSpeaker 14: But basically, this bill allows that to happen. So what I mean by that is the 10% minimum open space is a given as part of this bill for all site development over five acres. But there's built in flexibility so that if the Parks Department proposal, through their own adopted rules and regulations or any code changes, wanted to\nSpeaker 14: propose and look at additional Parkland requirements. There's the ability to do that within this bill and have them sync up with each other. So essentially this LDR process, for example, tees up that question of whether or not Parkland dedication will be required for the project per the Parks and Recreation Rules and Regulations as adopted.\nSpeaker 2: But right now, that greenspace requirement is still in discussion. Could happen, might not happen.\nSpeaker 14: It's pretty far along and I think there's a lot of momentum to it. But it's not it's not final yet.\nSpeaker 2: So we're not voting on that tonight.\nSpeaker 14: Correct? Yeah. Yeah, that's correct.\nSpeaker 2: The other thing about open space that I found interesting in her neighborhood cooperation was proposing a more complex way to assess open space. Right now, we assess it two dimensionally based on the square footage of the property, correct?\nSpeaker 2: The 10% number?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. It's a land area of the land.\nSpeaker 2: The land area. But there their point being that we're building so robustly now that there's probably a difference in what we need as far as open space. If we're talking a few 20 story buildings, then if we're talking a few five story buildings.\nSpeaker 2: And what was the thought in CPD about that?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. So that's there's a recognition that there's a deficiency there and an issue in terms of looking more holistically at open space for all projects. So all I can say is that this bill was about again about fixing a process, but we did improve the open space requirements by lowering the threshold and making it more applicable and\nSpeaker 14: making the design foster a publicly accessible, usable community benefit. But in order to look at all sites so not, you know, the ones that are smaller but maybe have more density, for example, I mean, that's something that while we would have liked to address with this bill, was a bit out of the scope in terms of looking\nSpeaker 14: at all projects, which I think is what the ideal state would be. They're looking at, for example, sites smaller than five acres, but also sites open space calibrated to intensities and densities and land uses and things like that.\nSpeaker 14: There's a whole big picture conversation, I think, that we want to have and probably will have to to address these sites more holistically.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: And then last question, Mr. President. Jeff. So as you know, when we passed Blueprint and we passed the comp plan, there was a statement added that in as we plan our city, addressing the need to mitigate our impact on climate change is our overarching guide.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm wondering what are the discussions in CPD at this point about what that means and how you might assess developments with that in mind?\nSpeaker 14: Oh, I know. Yeah, that's a big one. I mean, that's a that's a huge issue for sure. And I guess my only response to that would be this process improvement will again tee up those conversations better to where it's designed to look at all of those policies holistically, that being one of them, to figure out and to\nSpeaker 14: kind of put our heads together across all the city agencies to figure out if there are strategies that we could implement through the LDR process related to whatever it is, green infrastructure, things like that. There's so many strategies I think, that could get at that issue, but that's sort of a core it's definitely a core policy that\nSpeaker 14: would be better teed up through this process, I think.\nSpeaker 2: And I think you're probably. Be right. But I just wanted to point out that the wording is it doesn't say that we should also look at climate change. It says it's our overarching guide. It's our number one thing to be committed or to be considered.\nSpeaker 2: And so I know we're starting some discussions among members as to exactly how to approach that. And I'm hoping your department is as well. Awesome. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. Jeff, I want to clarify, did you say that the Development Review Committee would include people from representation from the Housing Division of Economic Development and from MAST? Because what I read in the ordinance was that it consists of the managers, CPD manager of Public Works, the zoning administrator, the fire chief and the manager\nSpeaker 6: of Parks and Recreation. Are we changing that in this text amendment or is that are they ad hoc members?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. So those they would not as part of this Texoma would be a part of the DRC and the DRC is already a set group. Right. And that's been codified. But what we did do is explicitly add those other agencies as referral partners as part of the frontloading of the evaluation.\nSpeaker 14: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: So they're not part of the initial decision making.\nSpeaker 14: Well, they will be at the table. Yeah, I guess in terms of what the code says but as one thing. But, but you know that that's the practice that we talked about how we're institutionalizing that they are part of that group that is deciding on these but the code is for the DRC is is kind of locked\nSpeaker 14: in.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. What is what.\nSpeaker 6: Is the public engagement process that the department is is looking at for? When you draw up the rules and regulations.\nSpeaker 14: For the for the community information meeting that's required.\nSpeaker 6: When you draw up rules and regulations for implementing the LDR. Process. And you're going to draw rules and regulations. How are you going to roll that out? How are you going to gather input from the public, from the community in general, from the landowners, from from the investors, from from everybody.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. So important to clarify. So the rules and regulations are supplemental to the code. So it's really only supposed to be about clarifications and like.\nSpeaker 6: I see the draft as.\nSpeaker 14: In here. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, there's a detachment to the staff report. So we in terms of vetting that, we've taken that to a planning board twice now and there'll be the third time next week. And we've certainly shared the public review drafts, but most of what is in there is clarification of what's in the text amendment\nSpeaker 14: . So there hasn't been. Yeah.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Should there be should more outreach or is are you figuring that going to the planning board is sufficient?\nSpeaker 14: Well, yeah. I mean, there's there's and like I said early in the presentation, we are actually working with some stakeholders who through this process have identified some issues with the rules and regs. So we're having some individual engagement on refinements to the rules and regs.\nSpeaker 14: But, um, but ultimately, you know, what is in the rules and regs is supplemental to the, to the bill, right? And being carried forward from, from what's already on the books with the GDP rules and regulations actually. So there's not a okay.\nSpeaker 6: But you know, where the ordinance, where the code that we're adopting tonight sets up the framework, it's sometimes the devil's in the details of the rules and regs. That's that's why. That's why I'm asking.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah, that's.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. All right. Well, I'll. I'll follow that. Let me give you a feed arrest and ask Jennifer a question. So. Halftime. Could you expand a little bit and explain the issue that you saw with the requirement for a public access easement on private open space?\nSpeaker 5: I can. The requirement for public access or a public easement over private property in the case of multi-family housing, which is a very narrow section and that would include for rent and for sale in the case of a for sale product.\nSpeaker 5: So condominiums or townhomes, for example, provided that that space meets the contiguity and width and all of those requirements under Kiawah or the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act. There are some requirements that you cannot burden private homeowners with public requirements.\nSpeaker 6: And so this would apply to a for sale.\nSpeaker 5: Correct. It would absolutely apply to for sale. It would apply to any for sale that met that requirement. That met that requirement. It would also.\nSpeaker 6: Not to a rental.\nSpeaker 5: It would also apply to rental. So in the case of rental or affordable housing, the concern or the primary concern there is that affordable housing, as you all know, is a very complicated issue that uses a very complicated set of financial mechanisms in order to create the framework so that it can happen in a public private partnership\nSpeaker 5: . Two of those more commonly known frameworks, one is Ly Tak, which is a low income housing tax credit product, and the other are some HUD loans that are subsidized with private financing or some soft financing, if you will.\nSpeaker 5: Both of those, it creates an issue of liability to have a public access and over private property, a required public access over the private property. And it also creates some real potential issues with the LURA or the land use restriction agreement that you have to make in order for the project to to continue to be low income\nSpeaker 5: over the 30 years of the property. So they're to put it to potential seriously legal issues in the limited case of multifamily.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Thank you, Jeff. Good. Let me follow up on that. That is there a is there any other mechanism that the city has at its disposal that would ensure that the private open space remains open space in perpetuity other than a public access easement?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. I'm not too knowledgeable, but there are. Yeah. I mean, you look at, for example, I believe through a subdivision plan with the, you know, with notations on it. And I'm not sure if through a development agreements, I'm kind of out of my league on that if that one would be possible.\nSpeaker 14: But there are and this in this language was drafted with the assumption that there could potentially be other tools. But we wanted to make sure that we had the ability.\nSpeaker 6: The intent with our is that this open space would remain public, open space as though it were a city park, even if it is publicly owned. Is that.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. I mean, I know. I don't know if I'd say as if it were a city park, but because that's a different sort of definition of the space. But that is the intent is to have a mechanism in place to remains publicly accessible in perpetuity.\nSpeaker 6: And one last thing, just generally. Are there circumstances where an area less than five acres could nevertheless also be subject to this process.\nSpeaker 14: To the for the open space or.\nSpeaker 6: To to LDR to the.\nSpeaker 14: Other process? Yeah. So yeah. So just as is in the current GDP world, something less than ten acres could be subject to it. Same thing with the five acre.\nSpeaker 8: Threshold.\nSpeaker 6: And then other circumstances that you could envision where an area greater than ten acres would not be subject to LDR.\nSpeaker 14: It's possible. Yep. Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you for that.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Flynn, Councilman Gilmore.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, President Clark. Jeff, could you talk a little bit more about the the DRC and I guess what the transparency is going to look like around how they're making decisions? Are we going to see kind of what their, you know, decision making metrics is or how are we going to have transparency around that so that if\nSpeaker 5: something does trigger the LDR, we understand how those decisions were made, but then as it goes through the process, my second question is how is the equity lens going to be overlaid on that process as well? Looking at different parts of the city, we sometimes get different development outcomes for a.\nSpeaker 5: Variety of reasons. And with CPD and Public Works and Parks and Rec and ultimately City Council going through equity training, how how is that going to, I guess, be woven into this process?\nSpeaker 14: Yes, that's a good question. So in terms of how to use the equity lens through the LDR process, again, so the process is designed to to bring those partners around the table and have the discussion about which equity policies could be applicable to the site at a citywide or neighborhood level.\nSpeaker 14: And so and then the idea is, you know, once those have been identified and this is a hypothetical, of course, but once those once those have been identified, figure out what the right tool is to achieve said community benefits related equity, for example.\nSpeaker 14: And so there may be in an LDR an articulation of what those benefits are at a higher level. And, you know, so and then it will and then the LDR might say through a development agreements address X, Y, Z, equity policies.\nSpeaker 14: And so that becomes a are an improved record, a document, the LDF that sets forth those parameters so that as development proceeds within the LDR area, there's that core, you know, that tie back that says, you know, whatever it says in the LDR, rezoning happens first in the infrastructure master plan.\nSpeaker 14: Concurrently with that, a development agreement to address said community benefits as part of that. So it's memorialized at that level, at least conceptually in terms of the equity lens. So yeah, I guess that's the answer.\nSpeaker 5: And then from memorializing it, I guess, how does the community have the assurance that it's actually implemented in that way?\nSpeaker 14: Yeah, so I mean, it's, it's a binding document that is recorded and publicly available. And so, um, so it's something that everyone would be held accountable to.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. And so I just again, you know, to my earlier question, just transparency around how those decisions are made so that when we're going out to a community meeting, folks can understand how we got to that place. Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah, that's fair. So so that's one of the I think one of the reasons why we we built in the community information meeting where we did in the overall kind of process. So going back to that flow chart, but essentially the community information meeting is repurposed from what it is in the GDP world today, which is basically\nSpeaker 14: a developer presenting and development concept in a in a plan. In a lot of ways, it's been repurposed more toward sharing the city's findings, for one, that the LDR was applicable. And why then also the preliminary scope to address key questions like is there an adopted plan?\nSpeaker 14: Are preliminary assessment that we will be sharing with the community at that meeting would be, you know, yes or no. There's an adopted plan that addresses this site. Here's the preliminary scope that we you know, we've started to develop with the applicant going forward.\nSpeaker 14: So that could address equity, the equity lens, for example. So the idea is to be able to share the information with the community as to how we got to where we are before anything gets finalized with, with the large development framework basically at the end.\nSpeaker 14: Um, so, yeah, so that's great.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. Thank you, President Clark.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilwoman Cannick.\nSpeaker 9: Thanks, Mr. President. I just wanted to briefly follow up with is it Jennifer, the attorney? Thanks so much. So I really appreciate, you know, wanting to look out for eventualities that could interfere with housing. But I guess I just wanted to ask, you know, having seen a lot of five and ten acre developments, I've never seen any\nSpeaker 9: at that scale that have put the open space in the private responsibility of an owner of a multifamily building versus under the ownership of the MAT district or the large. This is not a standalone this wouldn't you know, to Councilman Flynn's point, this wouldn't apply to the typical one parcel development.\nSpeaker 9: And so can you just answer, do you have a specific project in mind that's causing this concern or is this more of a just in case? Because I just don't in my, you know, 15 years of doing affordable housing, I've not seen the scenario that you're describing because typically they can't afford to use a portion of land\nSpeaker 9: in that way that's publicly accessible. That's just not a realistic thing that someone can finance in a typical project. I can't speak to the condo side, but again, just is this a specific project?\nSpeaker 5: You have great points, great questions. The answer is more from a large scale development process. So what I think is missing here is that the LDR process, as you heard, starts first and then subdivision happens and we're talking about large parcels.\nSpeaker 5: So you're talking about really master development in a lot of ways or development of large parcels, large areas. And then once so you're deciding at that point open space, you're deciding park land. You're making decisions that, as you're pointing out, really should be more on a site level or down on a local level as these master developers\nSpeaker 5: are talking currently with developers. Right. The land's not all just sitting fallow and no one's doing anything with it. They're master planning communities, of which that includes affordable housing. But what happens is those open space requirements, which are changed now and it changes the the entire landscape of what and when it's required happen, that happens on an\nSpeaker 5: upfront decision. It gets shared over the parcels on all of the property. So at that point, it does make it very difficult. It also means that local, the singular or parts of that development would be applied. You would have you could feasibly.\nSpeaker 5: And there are actually some. I have to be very careful with the attorney client privilege. I don't have the I'm sorry. I'm not being cagey. I just don't have the authority to disclose those projects. But yes, it does have the potential to have to affect potential projects.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. I'm just going to move to Jeff real quickly. Thank you very much. I appreciate that, Jeff. The previous speaker just made a reference to the idea that you would, you know, distribute an affordable housing requirement across all the parcels.\nSpeaker 9: That is only one option available. Nothing in this ordinance would require each individual portion of a large development to meet a percentage goal. In theory and in fact, most large development areas designate a portion of their site and dedicate a larger tract of, you know, open space for efficiency or whatever.\nSpeaker 9: They don't necessarily need under this policy to assure that each and every piece of vertical development within the project fulfills a percentage open spaces that I just want to clarify.\nSpeaker 14: Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, there's nothing in this bill that changes the allocation and distribution of affordable housing. I mean, the open space requirements are what they are. You can you can you can.\nSpeaker 9: You can fulfill them in one portion of the site and require none of your vertical developers to do any of it. In theory.\nSpeaker 14: That's correct. As long as you meet the 10%, you can allocated whoever you want. Okay.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you very much. No further questions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman. Each. All right. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 19 0494 is closed. We're going to move into the comment section. Are there comments by members of Council on this item? Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. You know, I also wanted to say as a I don't I don't I don't share the real concern about the potential that you're talking about simply because the master developer will apportion the open space in as appropriate, given the new process and those those parcels that will be dedicated or, you know, earmarked essentially for, you know\nSpeaker 8: , low income projects or housing, you know, housing developments will be we'll have to factor that in. You know, when you're when you're when you're when you when you sell that because it won't be on a parcel by parcel basis, it will be on the development scale.\nSpeaker 8: So unless you were doing some massive project, but again, it would still be there are so many ways to skin this cat. And that's what the beauty of this whole LDR process is, is it just allows it starts to close a lot of I mean, it starts to compel us to have a lot of conversations to finally\nSpeaker 8: get outcomes that we've been trying to get through a whole haphazard scheme of, of things. And so and it and it has some vagueness that I wish were tighter. But I think over time we'll find out whether we do need more regulatory constraints to handle those things as they come up.\nSpeaker 8: But it also then affords itself to be adaptable to those things as they as they come up. So just thank you all the volunteers, the staff that have been working on this for some time because it's one that's been desperately needed to be addressed and it will be, you know, future councils can look forward to seeing the\nSpeaker 8: results of the public process and potential rezonings that actually start to factor in some of the concerns that we've been articulating for the last four years that I've been here. Things.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Espinosa, Councilwoman Cannick.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. I really appreciated the comment from my colleague, Councilwoman Sussman. I'm going to miss you of saying how much planner speak is in all this and how to really boil down why this matters to people.\nSpeaker 9: And so I just want to say that I believe that this is an important step forward in creating a more rational, clear system for proceeding with large redevelopment. And my simple way of talking about it is, is there is a good plan and good guidance.\nSpeaker 9: Then this lays out the next steps. If there isn't a good plan and good guidance, then it says you have to have that first. And and I think that that's really important. And and it means the city leads it.\nSpeaker 9: We've had confusion, I think, in some large developments in the past where you have developer led processes sometimes creating a feeling that it's not an equitable process for the whole community. And so the number one change I expect to see come from this is where there's not plan guidance.\nSpeaker 9: We don't have to do what we did, you know, and thankfully the staff was amenable. But when, you know, Councilman Flynn and I talked about the Loreto Heights thing, it was we have to ask. For a process, you know, or when we talked about, you know, some of the sites, you know, they did not get a process\nSpeaker 9: that was city led. They had a developer led process. And so it was a situation of whether you were successful in advocating for that or you weren't. Now it's clear if it's a city led process, if there's not plan guidance or you better have a darn good excuse.\nSpeaker 9: And I appreciate a Councilwoman Gilmore's questions, I think this puts a lot of accountability on the administration and on the large.\nSpeaker 5: I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 9: Lldr0 lrc lrc. It puts a lot of onus on the administration to be very consistent in your decision making and very transparent in your rationales and to, wherever possible, include the council in that process. I think that where you do so, you end up with more consensus and more understanding of what the community needs are and more\nSpeaker 9: insight. So even though this is not our function under the charter, there is no reason we cannot be collaborative. And on projects like River Mile, where you worked closely with Councilman Brooks and Councilman Espinosa to think about those types of aspects of it.\nSpeaker 9: I think you had more success and we had more success as a city, so I wanted this to solve every problem we have with disconnects between affordable housing and planning. And it's probably not going to solve every problem that we have with those disconnects.\nSpeaker 9: But I did feel through three or four meetings that I had, both with the planning staff, the housing staff, including some of your high up directors, that that things are moving in a good direction and that the the the areas where improvement are needed are identified and new staffing is coming with new expertize.\nSpeaker 9: And so I do feel like this is going to put us in a better position to be more coordinated about equity and about preventing displacement before it happens. So for us to do all that will require a lot of vigilance.\nSpeaker 9: And so I hope that we check in on this, and I hope you keep really good data on each and every project that does or doesn't get selected and why and the size of those projects and the outcomes that open space.\nSpeaker 9: I think data is going to be really important for us, so I hope that's part of the work plan going forward. And then lastly, I will just say there was a lot of conversation about this other piece about, you know, community benefits as a way to doing equity.\nSpeaker 9: And we've just we're all using pretty different terminology. And, you know, there is some standardization out there in the rest of the country. And I know I've already started talking to some of the folks on the team, but there's a difference between when we put things that are good for the community in our agreements versus when the\nSpeaker 9: community gets its own agreement where they're the signatories and they're the enforcers and then how we support the community or whether we're at the table with them. And so I just hope that we all will sit at the table more and clarify what we're all talking about so that when the council members, both those here tonight and\nSpeaker 9: those that are new, are using the terminology and you are in the community as we all are using the same language. Because I do think that this for me, large development matters because of the impacts on a community and the change that it creates.\nSpeaker 9: Right. But it also especially matters because it is the biggest potential negative impact in terms of displacement or ripple effects, and it's also the potential to mitigate those effects. And so for me, that's what makes it so important.\nSpeaker 9: And I just want to thank you. I gave a lot of feedback, even though I don't sit in over four or five meetings. And you were really thoughtful and included a lot of that feedback and a lot of the changes.\nSpeaker 9: So I found it to be a really collaborative process and I want to thank the staff for all of the hard work and all the community members who served on it. Thank you. I'll be really excited to take this big step forward tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Canete. Seeing no other comments, I will just add and forgive me for being brief, but the hours late and we have more to do after this. Just thank you. I think this is a huge step forward in a lot of ways.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for all the work that went into this and and for bringing it forward. I will be happy to support it. And I don't think I've ever seen in four years that many people, almost everybody up here grilled with questions and then nobody else commented.\nSpeaker 1: So you guys did a great job answering everyone's questions during the question phase. So thank you, Madam Secretary. Roll call on Council Bill 494.\nSpeaker 5: Black Eye.\nSpeaker 8: Brooks I.\nSpeaker 7: Espinosa Flynn.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 7: Gilmore.\nSpeaker 8: I.\nSpeaker 7: Herndon. I Cashman.

        "source": "Speaker 2: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Hearing item number one.\nSpeaker 1: Recommendation to conduct a study session to receive and file a presentation on the Climate Action and ADAPT Adaptation Plan.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of city council. So this is a study session that we would like to bring to you to really talk about our climate action and adaptation plan. There's an incredible amount of work that's been going into this.\nSpeaker 9: This is something the council has told us is a priority to really plan for the future on climate action. And so with that, I will turn it over to the team. We have Linda Tatum, we have Christopher Koontz, and we have Allison Spindler to give the presentation.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor.\nSpeaker 5: And council members. I'd like to introduce Allison Spindler, who has lived and breathed this project probably for the last 18 months under the direction of our planning manager, Christopher Coons. And one of the things I'd like to bring your attention to during the presentation is that in last year's budget, the city council gave us an additional staff\nSpeaker 5: person to conduct a lot more extensive outreach. And this project in particular had has benefited significantly from that outreach. And you'll see that as we go through the presentation, given the the significant level of public involvement and not just outreach, but also very specific public engagement on this topic.\nSpeaker 5: And we're really proud of where we've come. And Allison can give you the details.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Linda. And good evening, Mayor, and members of the city council. I'm glad to be here before you this evening to provide an update on our work to develop the city's first ever Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.\nSpeaker 7: What is the cap? It will be our plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the city. Prepare our communities for the impacts of climate change. All while using this as an opportunity to improve quality of life health and enhance economic vitality here in the city.\nSpeaker 7: I would. So first, in terms of using our terms, what do we mean by climate action or climate mitigation? That's really about reducing the impact that we as people have on the future of our planet by reducing our future carbon emissions.\nSpeaker 7: This photo might look familiar as this is our number one form of emissions is transportation here in the city. And I know we've all been in this freeway situation. On the other hand, climate adaptation is recognizing that we need to adjust our own behaviors or systems and infrastructure to reduce the impact that climate change has on us\nSpeaker 7: . For example, elevating a road to reduce flooding or flood proofing a house. And this is important because a growing body of research is showing that not only is climate change here, but according to the UCLA review of all of the local research, it's already impacting our health in Los Angeles County.\nSpeaker 7: These photos are all real photos from Long Beach from two January's ago. The one in the middle is kind of fun that someone kayaking down one of the streets during an extreme rain event. The one on the right is a little more sobering.\nSpeaker 7: That's our police and fire services actually rescuing a wheelchair bound resident here in the city. So why are we here today in particular? We're at a critical point in the cap process. As mentioned in the opening, we've been doing a lot of research and background analysis to understand how Long Beach is and will be impacted by climate\nSpeaker 7: change. And to be honest, the estimated safety, health and economic impacts are significant. So it's a really important time in the process where we've been gathering and analyzing the data and now we're actually putting together a draft plan.\nSpeaker 7: So council feedback and direction is requested as we look at other areas of study that we missed. Do you have guidance as to our process as we go about refining the measures being considered for the plan? Any guidance as to how we should think about evaluating tradeoffs regarding funding and financing staffing to implement the actions we're talking\nSpeaker 7: about? Also, in consideration of the cost of inaction, feedback on our greenhouse gas reduction target, which I'll get into in a few minutes, and other priorities are areas that the Council would like us to look at. So this is not new work for Long Beach.\nSpeaker 7: We've been a leader in sustainability for a long time. As this timeline shows, starting back in 2006 with the port's first Clean Air Action Plan, in 27, we formed the Sustainability Commission in oh eight, the Office of Sustainability, and then began incorporating sustainability initiatives into our mobility element in 2013 and our land use element in 2017.\nSpeaker 7: I also want to point out in 2015, the mayor agreed to the what was then called the compacts of Mayors. Now it's called the Global Covenant, which is local jurisdictions and cities around the globe, committing to a low carbon and resilient city structure.\nSpeaker 7: So given all of those sustainability commitments, you might wonder why? Why a cap? Why now and why in planning? So the answer is that not only will it help us meet our our commitments to the global covenant, but the CAP will help us meet a whole host of state and local requirements, including AB 32 or SB 32\nSpeaker 7: , which requires us to reduce our carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. SB three, 75, 86, 99, 691, which relates to sea level rise and coastal areas and our requirements to the state for that. SB 1000, which requires a general plans incorporate adaptation and address impacts to disadvantaged communities.\nSpeaker 7: We're also using this plan as a mitigation measure of the land use element. So understanding that our city will continue to grow. How do we do it in the most sustainable way possible? Oops. As Linda mentioned, there's been a lot of research or sorry outreach that's been done, starting with several working groups.\nSpeaker 7: We have a scientific working group of 13 experts from Cal State, UCLA, the Aquarium and other local institutions that have really helped us make sure the data is correct. A business working group of local businesses as well as a community working group.\nSpeaker 7: We've collaborated with every city department to gather our data and look at the actions we're considering. We've done over 20 outreach events since June 2018 that were selected in collaboration with each council office and at least one event in every district.\nSpeaker 7: There was also an equity analysis that informed our outreach strategies, and we've had a real youth engagement focus recognizing that climate change is a multigenerational intergenerational equity issue. And so we're working closely with Youth Leadership Long Beach program, as well as various high school groups who are actively participating in this process.\nSpeaker 7: Here are a few stats. To Linda's point, we've had over 18 events where we've had cap tables reaching close to 8500 people at some events, large and small, such as Ready, Long Beach or Desert Nights at the Aquarium.\nSpeaker 7: We've also done 12 cat presentations, hosted two big city wide open houses, and hosted large events such as on the bottom right of the photo from our panel on sea level rise and what residents can do to prepare where we had over 300 people attend.\nSpeaker 7: We also surveyed every city department and 100% responded that they're already being impacted by climate issues related to infrastructure assets or core services. 88% of departments are engaging in greenhouse gas reduction strategies already. You'll note with the graph on the right that extreme heat is the climate stressor impacting the most number of city departments.\nSpeaker 7: Here are the climate hazards based on the data and science that are impacting Long Beach. Extreme heat, sea level rise, flooding, drought and poor air quality. Here are the community and infrastructure assets likely to be impacted, starting with our public health, housing and neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 7: City buildings are transportation, infrastructure, water supply, wastewater and stormwater assets. Our coastal resources. Parks and open space. As well as our energy infrastructure. I'm going to start with extreme heat because the data shows that extreme heat poses the greatest risk of life and health to the largest number of Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 7: In fact, approximately 275,000 of our residents are in the high, extreme heat vulnerability zone. Extreme heat is very serious and increases the risk of heat related illness, and even death increases vector borne diseases, tropical pathogens and parasites. Especially vulnerable populations include children, older adults, people with respiratory diseases.\nSpeaker 7: And those who work outdoors can lead to missed work in school. We've already heard from high school students who have had this happen in Long Beach. Damage to roads, highways and rail from extreme heat. And you may remember the power outage a few years ago.\nSpeaker 7: That was during an extreme heat wave. The data shows that between 1980 and 2000 in Long Beach, we had four extreme heat days a year. By 2050, we're looking at somewhere between 11 and 16 and by 2100, up to 37 days a year where it's over 95 degrees in a day.\nSpeaker 7: And with climate change, the cooling effect we get here at night is going to lessen. And this is not a future problem. It's a current problem. This graph shows you how extreme heat days have played out in the city for the past ten years.\nSpeaker 7: You'll notice we're already well over that for extreme heat day, your average. And you'll notice it was in 2015 that we had ten extreme heat days. And I know that members of the council will remember the power outage that we had here in downtown that lasted several days, impacted many residents, including seniors living in high rises without\nSpeaker 7: access to medication or keeping things refrigerated, without ability to get up and down the elevators. Our departments were, of course, very impacted. Everything from fire, help and police checking on wellness to our public works partners working on the infrastructure issues.\nSpeaker 7: Extreme heat is most dangerous in central, west and north Long Beach. As the map shows here, the highest vulnerability zone is and read the existing white dots or cooling centers that will already have. Extreme heat can also worsen air quality.\nSpeaker 7: So that's another challenge. Here are some of the adaptations we're considering. I mentioned earlier we have 200 adaptations and mitigations we're looking at for the plan, and now we're going through that prioritization process. But some examples include creating shade shelters at bus stops or in parks, increasing the presence of cool roofs or reflective streets, increasing our public\nSpeaker 7: water supply access, expanding our cooling centers, not only locations, but hours, because, again, it'll stay hotter at night. And developing emergency response plan for power outages and continuing to plant trees through our urban forest management plan. I also want to point out the social vulnerability to climate change map, because we know that some populations are more vulnerable\nSpeaker 7: to the impacts of climate change due to socioeconomic and demographic factors. For example, those that walk or take the bus because they have no car are have less ability to be resilient in getting out of an extreme heat situation or to be able to stay at a hotel at night when it's very hot.\nSpeaker 7: Similarly, renters can be more impacted and may not have as much ability to provide some of those protective factors, such as whether weatherproofing. Next, I'll move on to flooding. This is there are three different ways and Long Beach that we experience flooding.\nSpeaker 7: There's riverine flooding. So when when the rivers get really high and flood over, there's urban flooding. When our storm drain system does not meet the existing storms happening and then sea level rise and the associated coastal storms. So if flooding events can contribute to injury, death and displacement.\nSpeaker 7: The aquarium analyzed that over 22,000 residents in Long Beach are at risk to flooding by 2050 due to sea level rise. That flooding can include damage to wastewater and stormwater issues, as well as sewage back up that can lead to food and water borne illness and can disrupt, as we saw in the pictures here, the transportation system\nSpeaker 7: that could impact neighborhood connectivity and getting to work or school. This map shows you where our riverine flooding takes is projected to take place from the blue with the 100 year storm event and the orange and unlikely 500 year storm event.\nSpeaker 7: That's a 0.2% chance. And then we looked at various scenarios related to sea level rise. This shows you the the mid range projection for 2100. As you can see, the dark blue, our king tides are fairly extensive in terms of potential flooding.\nSpeaker 7: And the light blue would be a 100 year storm surge on top of it. You'll notice that this is also the first scenario where we see potential daily high tide impacts throughout parts of southeast Long Beach, parts of the of of west Long Beach, north of the port, are potentially helped out by the fact that the port\nSpeaker 7: is already doing an adaptation plan. And so this is, of course, under a no action scenario if we do nothing. And that's why we're here to develop the plan. We know that over 10 million square feet of residential property, 2 million square feet of commercial property, and another 2 million square feet of industrial property are in this\nSpeaker 7: flood area. Additionally, additionally, 74 miles of roadway, an electrical substation, three storm drain outfalls, ten stormwater pump stations and nine wastewater pump stations, as well as three portable facilities in that in that flood risk area. There is, of course, considerable uncertainty into the actual timing and extent of flooding.\nSpeaker 7: It depends on a number of factors, including the extent of any future shoreline or stormwater system improvements. But it's important to consider our best understanding of what these impacts could be. You'll also notice on the map several specific city buildings noted.\nSpeaker 7: This slide shows you how many city buildings are impacted by the different sea level rise scenarios. And the different scenarios are mapped out on our website in more detail. But you can see, for example, that we have in 2050 potentially three fire stations, a library and a parks building that are impacted.\nSpeaker 7: These costs would be substantial if needed for full replacement. And in terms of what we do about it, there is a whole host of adaptations we're considering around flooding, everything from updating the emergency response plan to updating our floodplain ordinance so that new building would consider that flood elevation, prioritizing low impact development and stormwater practices, relocating and\nSpeaker 7: elevating critical infrastructure, especially as we improve that infrastructure, elevating homes or businesses, looking at active or passive dune restoration as well as groundwater monitoring. And it's important to note the costs.\nSpeaker 5: Of of these.\nSpeaker 7: Sorry, the costs of these actions are very substantial. And we're already in talks with the financial management department understanding that given today's budgetary constraints, it would be impossible to meet the full cost of all these replacements. And that's why we need to be working together now.\nSpeaker 7: So here is our greenhouse gas reduction target scenario. We've looked at several different options based on the state guidance and the science available. There are several options here, but the main trend line, of course, is that it needs to go down.\nSpeaker 7: Staff has been recommending option D, which is a per service population. So that means for people that live or work here, how we reduce greenhouse gas emissions per person. We're recommending that per service population reduction for 2030 and 2040.\nSpeaker 7: We've also heard a good deal from community members who would like to see that carbon neutrality target in the plan. We think it's important to then consider an aspirational target for 2050, and that would be stocks recommendation because this plan will be something that we're held to in order to meet our SEQUENT obligations and therefore having the\nSpeaker 7: the D scenario option as well as the aspirational net carbon neutrality option, we see as a good balance for being bold and making a big commitment, but also understanding that as of today, there's no feasible way to get to that net zero given the technology out there, but that we want to continue to to have that aspirational\nSpeaker 7: target. Here's where our greenhouse gas emissions come from in the city. Over half is from our transportation sector at 54%, followed by the buildings where we live and work. Turning on the heat. The lights, the air. And then our waste sector is the third one.\nSpeaker 7: Here are some sample actions that we're considering on the transportation side. For example, making transit service enhancements both to improve our bus stops environment and also to increase our service and connectivity. You'll remember I mentioned shade structure. The bus stops on the adaptation side.\nSpeaker 7: This is where it could be a benefit on both the mitigation and adaptation side. For mitigation, you could help get more people on busses with better service stops. On the adaptation side, it helps reduce the heat for those that are already taking it.\nSpeaker 7: We're also looking at active mobility actions, such as increasing our bike and pedestrian infrastructure as the city continues to do electric vehicle deployment, as well as transportation demand management, working with large employers and of course land use and transportation planning.\nSpeaker 7: So increasing our density and mixing of land uses near transit stops is a really important way to achieve this. In terms of next steps, we're continuing to review and get feedback from the public on these actions as well as from other city departments.\nSpeaker 7: We hope to have a draft plan by the end of next month. We invite you all to our next open house June 1st, and then we'll be going through the Sequa process the latter half of this year and hope to be back before the Council in January 2020.\nSpeaker 7: We have a whole bunch of ways for people to stay involved. We have a business survey and a resident survey on our website, as well as more information and all of the maps and data that you've got here today.\nSpeaker 7: You can follow our hashtag Kapu Albee. Sign up for alerts for link. We have a special event coming up March 30th at Silverado Park on extreme heat and how it can impact older adults, children and other vulnerable populations.\nSpeaker 7: We hope you'll join us. And then you're all invited to our final cap open house. That'll be June 1st at Marine Stadium. There'll be interactive activities. We're going to have high school students running different booths and parts of the event.\nSpeaker 7: We hope you can all join us. And with that, could my presentation and I'm here to answer any question.\nSpeaker 0: Well, thank you. Thank you very much. I know you've been working a lot on this, and I know I've had a chance to to read the plan earlier. And it's it's really substantial. I want to thank staff that have been also briefing us on the progress of the Climate Action Adaptation Plan.\nSpeaker 0: And it was important, I think, to bring this forward and to do the study session as well. Let me start with Councilmember. Let me go through some of the councilmember comments and questions and then we'll go from there.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Richardson. I think he just stepped out and we got to find somebody, Ringo.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mary. And I want to thank staff for a very comprehensive report on clarity. I mean, we all know that our. Incumbent president doesn't believe in climate change. But I think that a report like this is very compelling and speaks volumes about where we're headed in a very near future within the next 20, 30 years and\nSpeaker 2: where we're going to be. And many of us who live under and on the plains know that we're probably not always going to be underwater. So a lot of the most important thing that I see in this report, and I know it's only a study, but it's okay, is to basically inform people what's coming.\nSpeaker 2: And I think that's the most important aspect of this of this report, is that we need to share it as much as we can. We had a discussion earlier today about the digital divide and and needing to increase our access to information.\nSpeaker 2: So I would like to see that we can get this report out as as far and wide as we can, especially for those individuals who, like myself, who live close to a river or a tributary or a location where we're sea level rise or flooding is very, very impactful.\nSpeaker 2: One of the things that I didn't see in here, obviously, and it's probably inferred, is that a lot of residents kind of look at their insurance policies when it comes to flooding and and the impact that that's going to have on their future in terms of housing, where they're going to be by any halt or where we're\nSpeaker 2: going to be constructing new homes and what the requirements are going to be to move into those areas where where flooding or and or a sea level rise is going to be a major impact in those communities. So I want to thank staff for this very comprehensive report.\nSpeaker 2: Looking forward to your open house and especially looking forward to your event on March 30th at Silverado Park, which is in the seventh District. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 6: I yes, I am very excited and I think I've expressed my excitement for doing a community action and adaptation climate plan. I do. I have some concerns. One is that we haven't had a community meeting in the second district and we haven't fully engaged the stakeholders in the second District on this plan.\nSpeaker 6: I appreciate and totally support all the actions that are that are listed here. And I do think that they seem to be kind of low hanging fruit. And so I would I do look forward to sitting down and meeting with you guys and engaging the second District and making sure that we have a plan that is similar\nSpeaker 6: to vision with L.A. and other cities that are really thinking outside the box and thinking about different funding sources, different grants. You know, we shouldn't just be, you know, increasing bus routes, but we should be talking about how do we get every single bus to be electric and how do we make sure that we're leveraging our resources\nSpeaker 6: and community partners as much as we can? So I appreciate where it's at. And I guess I just I'm a little concerned that the data is supposed to come out next month when we haven't had a full engagement yet.\nSpeaker 6: So I hope to meet with you guys soon. And I know that my staff is working with you guys on a date on April around Earth Day, and I think that's been the talk for the last month. So I hope that we can pin that in and not pencil it in.\nSpeaker 6: I look forward to hearing from community members as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. I would just. I'm actually going to commence that for the the great report here. I think it's pretty comprehensive and certainly eye opening for for me. I did want to get some clarification and go back to the to the map where you.\nSpeaker 11: That bet. That map and you mentioned the amount of square footage in terms of is that residential square footage a million square feet?\nSpeaker 7: Yes. Let me just pull back up the numbers so I'm certain. So this is under the 2100 mid-range scenario, and there is an 80 page assessment on the website that goes into a lot more detail. But under this particular scenario, it would be over 10 million square feet of residential property, 2 million square feet of commercial, and\nSpeaker 7: another 2 million of industrial in that zone. And that's under a king tide scenario. So that's a couple of times a year flooding as a sub area. That would be the daily high tide scenario. And we can send that map along as well.\nSpeaker 7: But it is a significant amount of property if nothing is done to prevent it.\nSpeaker 11: We said nothing is done. The the recommendations in this plan, if we were to fully execute on the local level, all of those those those recommendations where we have an impact on on that forecast and happening now.\nSpeaker 3: So to do that.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you for the question. Yeah. So I only gave a few examples, but we are looking right now at about 200 potential actions. I don't know that you would all want to hear every single one, but we are doing the analysis to look at how it would protect sort of area by area on the adaptation side and\nSpeaker 7: that would have a significant impact in terms of protection. Now as we get to these longer term ranges such as this one, the 2100 mid range, it becomes a little bit trickier when you think from maybe once or twice a year flooding to that more daily high tide, but everything from the sort of natural protections to elevating\nSpeaker 7: and flood proofing, really, it's going to take a whole variety, but would have a substantial impact in protecting us.\nSpeaker 11: And Councilmember Austin to expand further in the focus of this effort is to protect city assets and protect our ability to respond to disasters and provide lifesaving services, ticket to life and property. It's also to facilitate the private sector ability to storm proof and relocate improvements.\nSpeaker 11: But it's not the city's responsibility or intention to be able to to mitigate the potential damage to those millions of square feet of private development. They're privately held, and they'll make financial decisions and their insurers will make financial decisions about the future of those properties.\nSpeaker 11: And certainly we have an obligation to make that process as fruitful as we can. But the city is not taking on the financial or liability to to respond to the risks to all of that private property. I understood I guess I was looking at it from a standpoint of of being a resident here in the housing and\nSpeaker 11: neighborhoods impacts and how many families would would certainly have to relocate or thinking about how the city will look in 100 years. It's pretty interesting, pretty thought provoking. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. I just want to say thank you for this report. I just wanted to ask, first and foremost, have we done any of the community meetings fully in Spanish or Combi at all?\nSpeaker 7: To this point, it's only been through translation, which we do provide at our major events in both Spanish and Kimye. But we are in the planning process right now to do a Spanish only event. And I know we've been in touch with several groups, including some groups in the first District, who are willing to help us with\nSpeaker 7: that.\nSpeaker 4: Great. I think of a lot of the women in the Spanish speaking community that whose children are suffering with asthma. We have some of the worst asthma rates in the district near the port. And so I want to make sure that they are that they have their concerns addressed in this clean air action plan, as well as\nSpeaker 4: our Cambodian community members who have also expressed interest in this very much. Thank you. And what I would say is I would like to also see, you know, when it comes back, you know, definitely more specificity on the type of and, you know, maybe it doesn't come up necessarily because some community members see it in such a\nSpeaker 4: high level. But there are other cleaner action plans that I've seen in other areas that specify the type of pollutants and what it could do in specific neighborhoods. And just to get people educated on and I know it's not always exciting to see those things, but it's important for people to understand, you know, what is in our\nSpeaker 4: backyard and what is maybe affecting our communities or are affecting our communities. Another thing is, you know, I think as we've talked about open data as well and having two innovation centers that will be coming to downtown, perhaps there's some synergy with creating sort of like, you know, L.A. has the L.A. clean tech incubator.\nSpeaker 4: It's a think tank of sorts with the private sector and the public sector. And they come together and really think tank on whether it's air quality or it's, you know, sea level rise, what have you. And they they actually through that, those partnerships are able to work with entrepreneurs that want to find solutions for those and or\nSpeaker 4: work with academic institutions to find solutions for some of these these issues. So just a thought there and thank you very much. I look forward to seeing this evolve and adding my input as on behalf of the First District.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So one of these slides show that significant contributor were mobile mobile sources of mobile sources of pollution, you know, automobiles, diesel trucks and and things like that. And so, you know, it appears to me that we should, you know, as we move forward, we yeah.\nSpeaker 8: That's the one 54%, right. Is mobile sources. And so that just tells me that we should, you know, certainly accelerate our efforts to make sure that we're, you know, expanding transit outside of that just one mile, the last mile, but into the last two miles, for example, in North Long Beach, where I showed the map of the\nSpeaker 8: urban heat island stuff happening. That area is outside of most of the last mile implementations because it's two miles away from the connection, the two to the blue line in Compton or down at the Wardlow station about three miles.\nSpeaker 8: And so we need to really think about as we design, you know, I know what a lot of times the best practices get handed down or last mile, but we need to make sure that they make sense for Long Beach.\nSpeaker 8: You should be last to mile. And I hope that, you know, once this is adopted, maybe I'll frame this as a question. When this is adopted, is this going to ensure that, you know, policies and programs that come out of that, that are coming from staff are already like the lens on climate.\nSpeaker 8: Our climate adaptation plan will already be reflected there. Is that the way this would be used?\nSpeaker 11: So Councilmember Richardson, this document would be a binding document. So any action that required a finding with their general plan, so that's planning items, but that's also the copy that comes to you annually as part of the budget would need to be consistent with this.\nSpeaker 11: So it is intended to translate to better informed and decision making processes, and it is designed to make sure that our our investments, especially our capital investments, are reflective of accomplishing the goals in this plan. Sure.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. And so maybe we think about, you know, when this gets adopted, how we can, you know, formalize it by having, you know, maybe some sort of a climate action statement on agenda items that are related to this, because there's things separate from the air process, the environmental process.\nSpeaker 8: There are investments that we make into infrastructure and other things that are public that we would like to know. Does this you know, this is this in a, you know, a red zone? Is it does it help to, you know.\nSpeaker 8: Does it contribute to our our adaptation plan or is this a bad investment or it doesn't acknowledge the climbing habitation? That's something maybe we could think about. Is that something that's considered like.\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. So we can certainly we can certainly work on refining. When you receive council letters, there is a sustainability section, but it's pretty streamlined today and we can look at making that a more formalized process that reflects back to this plan.\nSpeaker 8: I think that makes sense. And additionally, a lot of times when we go after so I serve on the Mobile Source Reduction Committee Board which administers millions of dollars to local governments, transportation authorities to reduce mobile sources of pollution.\nSpeaker 8: And, you know, we've we funded different grants and the city of Long Beach have gone to, you know, charging stations and and things like that. But I think we should think about maybe coming up with something, something custom, that meet some of our needs that we haven't gotten to yet.\nSpeaker 8: Like maybe, you know, I don't know, bike share or some of these things. We, we, we work together to customize this proposal and make it because we're, we're creating the three year plan for the MSR, see, right now.\nSpeaker 8: And so now would be the time to figure out what we can do within the next three years to fund. And there's, you know, millions of dollars on hand. So I just want to, you know, no response is needed, but I just want to raise that up.\nSpeaker 8: Another thing that's interesting is that, you know, when we look at the extreme heat map and you see that the central and west and north Long Beach areas, you know, are dramatically impacted. And then you flip to the sea level rise the sea level rise map.\nSpeaker 8: You see that the beach communities are or dramatically impacted. It impacted particularly the peninsula. There's not very many issues that we would see that north west and east Long Beach have in common. And so I think in this case is it's a rare opportunity for us to really just think big about an implementation that's good for East\nSpeaker 8: Long Beach will be something that's good for West Side or for North Long Beach. And so I know there's there, you know, I mean, to be honest, there's always sensitivity when you talk about sea level rise and climate change.\nSpeaker 8: And and I think it's good that you acknowledge the fact is that, you know, that much property is susceptible to sea level rise or that much investment. So we should think about how we can sort of lead with the implementation that impacts everyone and makes the most difference for everyone because this is, I think, an opportunity to\nSpeaker 8: make sure that, you know, the city's unified in terms of its voice on climate change. And so that's something I'll be looking forward to as a move forward, like maybe not having a lot of times there's there's multiple messages in different areas.\nSpeaker 8: And I think we should look at what's the common message that unifies everybody behind this this issue, because it's not real for a lot of people, but it will have real impacts. And we put up a slide of 2100.\nSpeaker 8: But I think if we put up the slide of, you know, 2050, which is, you know, 30 years away, I think, you know, frankly, we might get a bigger impact, a bigger reaction from people if we saw that.\nSpeaker 8: So those are some of my my my initial thoughts on this. I think it's a it's incredibly important. I thank you for the for the study session, I think is needed. I know we have a lot of work to get to tonight, but I think we need we need we certainly need to pay more attention to this\nSpeaker 8: . Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I just want to add, I think it's important to acknowledge that it's been this council and just in the last few years that the city has been talking about climate change. And I think it's important to recognize that.\nSpeaker 0: And and it's important to know that the city believes and understand that climate change is real. It's happening. It's a scientific fact. Sea level rise will impact the city, but also know that it's not just about sea level rise.\nSpeaker 0: The biggest impact that we will face as a city, it directly will impact us. As a report had noted earlier, around heat and around temperature and issues around sea level, sea level rise are critical, but we cannot lose sight on what will be what we will face immediately over the next couple of decades.\nSpeaker 0: And that is that we will have parts of our city, particularly in many low income communities, that will be greatly affected by rising temperature. And we will have seniors and in particular affected by not having enough access to cooling centers and places to actually eat, to stay cool in these heat and in these in this in this\nSpeaker 0: increase heat. And so I want to thank the staff for working on this. I do want to thank the the impetus for where we got here today with this cap plan, really started with an initial report that we asked the Aquarium of the Pacific to undergo.\nSpeaker 0: And I think in the first year that I was mayor and its council formed, we went out, asked the aquarium to do an initial report on climate change. They came back a year later with a study that involved a bunch of really great scientists from across the country.\nSpeaker 0: That morphed into our signing the Mayors Climate Compact, committing to some targets. And then most importantly, the staff have been working now for a couple of years on this climate action plan very hard. And I want to recognize our sustainability team.\nSpeaker 0: They are small but mighty. They do a great job. I want to thank our Sustainability Commission, who also does a great job of uplifting issues and and policies. And I want to more broadly just speak to why where the city has made some incredible progress.\nSpeaker 0: The port, as we're aware, has what I think is probably the most aggressive climate action plan of any port in the United States. And that's something that we continue to push through the port, the airport, things to Councilwoman Mango and and partnering with me and others has embarked on a similar climate action plan that is specific to\nSpeaker 0: our airport. And then when you look at the expanded park space, our issues of of park equity, that is also been something that's been that has been pushed by this council. In addition to that, I want to note that some of the smaller initiatives of of the body, whether they've been ensuring that we have a strong, active\nSpeaker 0: , multimodal transportation program around bike share, around transit and councilwoman, we do have electric busses. As you know, we've rolled out numerous electric busses on Long Beach Transit. We're actually one of the first cities to have electric busses in the nation.\nSpeaker 0: And we're our goal is to convert every single bus to electric here in Long Beach. And we're going to be one of the first cities to do so, whether it's been the conversion of all of our LED lights, all of our old I'm sorry, energy inefficient lights to led, which we were one of the first cities again\nSpeaker 0: to convert the entire city to residential and now going to commercial led. And of course the work that's happening around water quality restoration of both the lagoon wetlands and the expansion of park space I think has been significant.\nSpeaker 0: That's not to say that we are doing everything right or that we're doing enough to stop climate change. And there's still a lot of work for us to do, as we're all aware around issues, around fossil fuel consumption, around issues about mobility and the seven, ten and around air quality.\nSpeaker 0: And so these are things that we know are next for us to deal with and that we have to address. They are real and they affect us every single day. But I just do want to commend this this body for the work that's happened, but the work that's ahead, because we have a lot more work to do\nSpeaker 0: as it relates to climate change in the years ahead. And so, again, thanks to the staff and I want to open this up for public comment.\nSpeaker 2: My very good. You a firm believer. A firm believer in climate change. Those who don't believe it. Will be out the door quicker than those that saddle up to those that engender the epidemics of corruption. One of the things we should make clear, though, particularly around the waterside area, that our shoreline area is what the rules are\nSpeaker 2: relative to city employees not fishing off the company pier. No matter where that pier may be, there are some that fail to understand. The downside of doing that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Nick Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Hi. My name is Julie Jean from the third district. And. I want to thank you very much for including climate change is a very important feature of the change in Long Beach. I wanted to suggest that. But first, let me introduce myself also as a part of a group called No Kill Long Beach.\nSpeaker 5: And here's the sign in a sign says Adoptions Fosters Behavior, Rehab Volunteers Rescues TNR, which is trap and release. Low cost spay neuter. Pet retention. Community outreach and proactive redemption. That's part of the program. The reason why I brought that up is because the animals at the shelter or the pound on spring are really experiencing severe problems\nSpeaker 5: from the climate change as well. It's very hot out and last summer it was scorching. These animals sit there in that shelter without. They do have shade, but I mean, they're sweltering. And also, it's been very cold this winter has been the coldest that I ever remember.\nSpeaker 5: And those animals don't have any warmth, any place where they can find refuge from the cold. So I wanted to bring that up and hoping that in your future consideration of climate change, that you'll give the animals a break in terms of their overheating and being cold.\nSpeaker 5: Also, I wanted to suggest that you put out water fountains. At key intersections where people walk in the city. They don't just walk downtown, they walk all over the place. They don't walk just in Belmont Shore. They're there in every neighborhood.\nSpeaker 5: So I think it would really be nice if they could get some water respite. You were talking about adding access to more city water. I think when I was a little girl, there were water fountains everywhere. Now there are no water fountains.\nSpeaker 5: If there are, I don't know where they are. So I think that might be a nice addition.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you guys so much. Next week, complete.\nSpeaker 5: Hello. City Council members, Mr. Mayor. We are from the social work and community outreach, organizing, development of future mental health professionals at Long Beach Poly High School. In addition to all our work and other projects right now, we are working on a project of the utmost importance, which is climate disruption.\nSpeaker 5: You spend your days fixing problems, developing budgets and trying to make things better for Long Beach. However, now, none of that will matter soon when climate disruption displaces tens of thousands of people from this city and others. We are at a critical point in this process, so changes and decisions need to be made.\nSpeaker 5: While eliminating fossil fuels and turning to renewable energy is the most important change needed, we have found through research that reducing meat consumption is an easy and extremely effective way to slow down climate disruption. Here are the facts.\nSpeaker 5: Scientists found that we need to reduce our meat consumption by 90% to slow down climate disruption. Americans are 5% of the world's population, yet we consume 25% of the Earth's resources. It takes 800 gallons of water to make one quarter pound hamburger, and 70 to 83% of all agricultural land is used for meat consumption.\nSpeaker 5: We cut down 65 trees a minute to create more of this meat consumption related farmland. The average person in.\nSpeaker 6: America is over.\nSpeaker 5: \u00a3220 of meat in 2018. This is both physically unhealthy and environmentally. Studies in America and the Netherlands showed that 88 to 94% of people don't understand the connection between meat consumption and climate disruption. And 80% of our students didn't know these facts.\nSpeaker 5: There are 1 billion humans that are starving and un nourished and 2 billion overweight humans. Another valuable outcome of meat consumption reduction is to help create farmland that directly feeds these people. This food crisis is real. Real leadership does not require a title or an office.\nSpeaker 5: Leadership is willingness to show courage when others are in fear or despair. Leadership is the extreme example of doing what's right, even when it's uncomfortable. Leadership is risking ridicule from others, even though it will make a huge difference in other's lives now and down the road.\nSpeaker 5: We are proposing that this city be a leader and become a meat consumption. Meat consumption reduction. To slow down climate disruption city create a campaign to reduce meat consumption by each citizen. Encourage restaurants to increase their non-meat offerings.\nSpeaker 5: Have contests for businesses that encourage employees to reduce meat consumption. And also please accelerate the Flood Control Synergy project as it is very important to climate disruption. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. And hold on once again, is everyone in line is going to speak on this item. I'm going to close the speakers list. Everyone's in line. They're going to close the speakers list.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Unless and I know we have a very long agenda tonight, unless there's any objection after the gentleman with the hat, we're going to go down to 2 minutes for speaker. Okay. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Elegans. All that is on file. Um, I really appreciated a lot of the comments made by some of the council members. Um, I, I wanted to say that this will require a great deal of divestment on behalf of this city.\nSpeaker 2: As everyone knows, Long Beach's greatly invested in fossil fuels. Our city was founded on fossil fuels. We have a city that is actually a tax haven for the wealthy called Signal Hill in the middle of our city.\nSpeaker 9: All of these are sucking the resources from beneath.\nSpeaker 2: The planet at the expense of our future.\nSpeaker 9: At the expense of our water, at the expense of our air. It causes asthma. It causes heart disease. It causes cancer. People die. Babies are born at low birth rates. And this is the reality already. Now the sea level is rising.\nSpeaker 9: Mother Earth is about to do her due vengeance for all the hell that we.\nSpeaker 2: Have inflicted upon people, upon communities, for the wealth of our nation and of what we call the developed nation at the expense of indigenous lands and all of the earth. So now that we are at this planetary crisis, the globe is requiring a great cooperation.\nSpeaker 2: And in this great cooperation, we as a humanity must come together with an incredible amount of courage and speak out against the fossil fuels, the richest industry in the history of money, and tell them that enough is enough that we will no longer drill for oil, no longer drill for gas under our city.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm asking the members of this city council, do you have that courage for future generations? Do you understand that everything that we love is at stake? And I know that many of you.\nSpeaker 9: So-Called Democrats tend to say that you believe in this type of stuff. You like our speeches, you show up at our marches.\nSpeaker 2: You like you like what we're about. But when it comes to you taking the money from these industries, you don't have the courage to say no. You don't have the courage to say enough is enough. When it comes to the.\nSpeaker 9: Issues of this so-called action plan, are you calling for.\nSpeaker 2: 100% renewable energy like the science is calling for, or are you willing to work with some of your donors and find out what works for them?\nSpeaker 9: Because that's what's at stake. We're talking about asthma, we're talking about air.\nSpeaker 2: We're talking about everything that we love. We're talking about every precious child that you have ever met. What kind of future are you going to leave behind for them? I want to talk about some of the water that we're selling from the recycled water managed by the water department to the oil and gas industry.\nSpeaker 2: I believe that that needs to end. If we're going to talk about adapting our climate. Taking climate change seriously, we have to stop drilling. We should.\nSpeaker 5: At least stop selling.\nSpeaker 2: Them to water. I believe that we committed a great atrocity to the original people of this land, a people who believed in saving resources for the next seven generations. We are now taking the fossil fuel wastewater because there's a waste that comes from the drilling.\nSpeaker 2: Now all the good stuff is gone. They use fracking and acid dying to get that last bit from underneath the earth and it produces a.\nSpeaker 9: Waste and we're pumping that into aquifers.\nSpeaker 2: Here in California. I bet none of you are receiving any reports about that. That needs to be included into this report. You need to understand what is at stake.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Gonzales. And the Speaker, please come forward.\nSpeaker 5: Good morning, Mayor Garcia, City Council Member City Staff. My name is Alice Stevens, I I'm a resident of District four and a registered nurse who works with children in the public school system. I'm also a mother of two middle schoolers of my own.\nSpeaker 5: Happy birthday, Sophie. Who are very concerned about the climate and their future. So I helped to start a group called Long Beach 350, where a climate justice group that formed in 2015, right around the time, as Ms. been there, said that Mayor Garcia signed on to the Compact of Mayors.\nSpeaker 5: Now the Global Covenant of Mayors to commit our city to significantly reduce our carbon footprint. It was also the time when the Paris Climate Summit was happening and in which world leaders and later a network of our nation's mayors.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mr. Garcia. Dr. Garcia. It agreed to work to limit our global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To put that in perspective, right now we are at a rise of point nine degrees. And I can say from based on our past recent summers, that's incredibly hot.\nSpeaker 4: Especially if you don't have a.\nSpeaker 5: So the our name the 350 and Long Beach 350 is comes from the parts per million of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere that scientists consider a safe level and comfortable climate in which to live. We're now hovering about 410 parts per million, and if we don't act now on climate change, it's going to climb much, much higher\nSpeaker 5: . My kids don't want that and I'm sure none of yours do either. So I'm here to thank the city for committing us to undertake a climate action plan and having this presentation today. This is a crucial step for the city to protect our climate and also to make good on the commitment Dr. Garcia has made three years\nSpeaker 5: ago. Several of our Long Beach, 350 members have been attending the community workshops and open houses held by the city. And we've read the documents that are on the cap website. We appreciate having an open and collaborate collaborative process in developing the plan, not just with invested businesses, but with people invested that live here in the community\nSpeaker 5: . Some of these members are here today to speak on the recommendations we have come up with to ensure the city has a plan that is ambitious, effective and built on the firm foundation of social justice principles. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next week.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Council members and staff. My name is Erin Peterson. I'm a resident of the third council district and a member of Long Beach 350. I'm also a business major at Cal State Fullerton. It's important to me, as well as all of Long Beach 350, that the CAP include the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse\nSpeaker 2: gas emissions. A goal of reducing emissions by 60 to 80% would be laudable, but it would not be enough to correct the disastrous course we are now on. Many harmful and catastrophic impacts are already occurring, such as increasing frequency of tornadoes, storms and flooding.\nSpeaker 2: We must curb carbon completely. But committing to zero carbon is only half the goal. We must also make sure to achieve it as soon as possible and no later than 2045. We recommend this target year based on our reading of the warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius report developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the Paris\nSpeaker 2: Agreement. Among the proposals presented by city staff today target option F specified net zero emissions, but not until 2050. We urge you to adopt this option, but modified to specify the year 2045. I'm especially concerned about making the cap as effective as possible because of my young age.\nSpeaker 2: The actions we take now will be mine and my generation's burden. And the work starts today. Setting a goal of net zero emissions by 2045 will give the city, its residents and businesses 25 years to meet the challenge.\nSpeaker 2: The consequences of failure will be disastrous. We cannot afford not to set ambitious goals. Thank you for your consideration.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Excellent. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. My name is Dean Todd. I live in the seventh district. I teach at Cal State, Long Beach. I'm on the Science Advisory Committee to the CAP tonight. I don't have a blue T-shirt, but I'm with the Long Beach 350 also.\nSpeaker 2: We've came up with four recommendations. So the one I'm speaking on is this. The greenhouse gas inventory should include greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels extracted within Long Beach city limits. You know, some people say that it's not our responsibility because the fuel is burned somewhere else.\nSpeaker 2: But for global warming, it doesn't matter where it comes from. It matters where it's burned. It can be burdened. It could be burned anywhere. We might not use it here, but it's it's only bought in order to be combusted.\nSpeaker 2: So the fossil fuels from Long Beach will add to global warming. So we need to acknowledge that reality and to include it in the greenhouse gas inventory. I think to do it is necessary, but it's also smart. Here's the necessity.\nSpeaker 2: We can't avoid dealing with climate change. The world is recognizing that we have to get down to zero emissions really fast. California is creating policies to do the same thing. That means to me that fossil fuels are going to be restricted in a lot of different ways and fossil fuel extraction is going to be restricted.\nSpeaker 2: That's going to do a lot of good things in making a transition to a different, better energy system. But it's going to be really rough in a lot of ways as well. So we need to start planning to do it.\nSpeaker 2: That's the smart part. Workers are going to lose jobs when it happens. It's got to be done, but people will lose their jobs. We have to make plans to help them. The city is going to lose revenues. That's going to depend on the budget with a big part of the budget from the extraction.\nSpeaker 2: We got a plan for that. Residents, workers and businesses will lose services or pay more taxes or both. So we have to make up we have to plan for that. So it's better to face reality and it's smarter to plan for it.\nSpeaker 2: So we would like to have the the fossil fuels, the emissions from the fossil fuels extracted in Long Beach included in the greenhouse gas inventory. It's our responsibility and it's the smart thing to do.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. Next week.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Council members and staff. My name is Lillia and I am a Long Beach resident and.\nSpeaker 5: Also a member of Long Beach 350 Gorg. Everyone will be harmed by climate change, but some will be harmed more than others. The city's draft plan and workshop materials show projected flood impacts.\nSpeaker 4: Concentrated needed near.\nSpeaker 5: The coast and flood channels and heat island effect concentrated in the communities on the west side of Long Beach, where there are less parks and street trees. In addition to these geographic concentration consideration, residents with lower incomes and more social market.\nSpeaker 4: Marginalization will surely face more.\nSpeaker 6: Challenges in.\nSpeaker 5: Adapting to climate change and coping with climate disasters than wealthier.\nSpeaker 6: Residents.\nSpeaker 5: The Climate Action Adaptation Plan and the resources it guides must give priority to those who need them the most. This is common sense. The first step toward doing this would be to identify the vulnerable communities of.\nSpeaker 6: West Long.\nSpeaker 4: Beach by name in plan materials.\nSpeaker 5: They should then follow up with prioritizing the resources. Long Beach 350 Forward recommends an equitable allocation in which the bulk of the resources and funding, such as two thirds, is distributed to the most vulnerable areas where about half of the city population lives.\nSpeaker 5: There are the areas of high social vulnerability in the language used in the plan. Distributing an equal share to every part of the city would not fully meet the most, would not fully meet the most acute human needs.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you for your consideration.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next week, Ripley.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, Mayor Garcia, council members and staff. My name is Patricia Chen and I'm a resident of the Fifth Council District and a member of Long Beach 350. I'm also an urban planner, so I understand that plans and their implementation can have a major impact on the public some positive, sometimes negative.\nSpeaker 5: The cap is no exception, and Lillia just described how climate change impacts residences differently in different areas. And the CAP adds another layer to this and has additional impacts on residents. The city must take care in developing the cap to avoid exacerbating the negative effects of climate change.\nSpeaker 5: Where are the weather? Excuse me? Where there are burdens to be borne by the public, such as regulations or taxes. The cap must include consideration of how the burdens are distributed between residents and take care not to place disproportionate burdens on the most vulnerable communities.\nSpeaker 5: Similarly, where plan implementation makes benefits available, such as discounts, incentives, job opportunities and training, the plan must be developed to ensure the benefits are not skewed toward the higher income residents that need them the least. Some examples of careful distribution of benefits would be planting more street trees in areas of high social vulnerability and developing community solar\nSpeaker 5: implementation programs so that residents don't need to own a home to participate in energy that is cleaner, more cost effective and reliably available over the long term. Examples of Avoiding Harm or Disproportionate Burdens. One really big one would be when putting in transportation infrastructure.\nSpeaker 5: Always combine it with measures to ensure affordable housing to avoid displacement and gentrification. So to summarize. Well, okay, you heard it all. Thank you very much and thank you for your consideration.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Speaker.\nSpeaker 6: Hi, Karen.\nSpeaker 7: Recite a resident of the first district.\nSpeaker 5: Representing the Long Beach Gray Panthers. Mayor Garcia, we want to thank you for your leadership and this initiative. You've been one of the leaders out front and council members that have focused on these target areas. And the staff who Allison, Christopher, Linda and Fiona, you've just been amazing to work with and working on this project.\nSpeaker 5: The Long Beach Gray Panthers are one of the co-sponsors of the event, along with Councilmember Urunga and Long Beach, 350, and the citizens.\nSpeaker 6: Climate lobby being held.\nSpeaker 5: On March 30th at Silverado Park. We are going to focus on solutions that people can do to prepare. One of the reasons the building I live in did so well during the power outage was because we had attended cert training.\nSpeaker 5: We are going to encourage more people to go through cert training and have more emphasis and emphasis on climate action changes. We know the plan is going to evolve. This first attempt, we will make some mistakes. But the more aggressive we can get on the changes to move to a zero carbon emission city and the faster we\nSpeaker 5: can pastor, we can do it. We can potentially lower our ASM rates.\nSpeaker 7: I'm sorry, I have a little announcement.\nSpeaker 5: Tonight and we want to continue to focus on seniors. The heat really is absolutely critical.\nSpeaker 6: Libraries don't stay open very late. The building I live in.\nSpeaker 7: Cinder block.\nSpeaker 5: Construction. The heat emissions continue.\nSpeaker 6: Long after the 9:00.\nSpeaker 5: Closing times. And this is a big problem for.\nSpeaker 6: A lot of the areas of the community.\nSpeaker 5: That don't have ocean breezes. If those continue in the future. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, counsel. I'm Grace Lorenson from the seventh District, and I'm also part of the citizens climate lobby. And I really appreciate everything that the city has been doing on this cap thing. And every time I go to one of the meetings, I say, And what about national legislation?\nSpeaker 5: You know, we've got to do something nationally. And the citizens climate lobby is very happy to let you know that there is a national legislation out now that could be promoted. And it's one that was supported by the California State Senate in in 2016.\nSpeaker 5: Quite a while ago I saw AJ are 43 and they said they approve a joint resolution calling on Congress to enact a carbon based taxed on fossil fuels and return the proceeds to low and middle income families. So that's something that our state, our state Senate and Assembly had approved.\nSpeaker 5: And the mayor has gone on record with the Council of Mayors. And I think that we need the city to at least look at the national legislation, and it's called Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. That's Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act.\nSpeaker 5: It's H.R. 763. And it has been introduced to Congress. It's been supported by at least four religious organizations. I'm also a part of the Unitarian Church and many other organizations, so I hope you will look into it and support it.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Complete.\nSpeaker 10: Hello, council members. My name is Elizabeth LAMB, and I wanted to open my remarks with a quote that has stuck with me. And I had to research it and remember who originally said these words. And it was our president, Barack Obama, who said, we are the first generation to feel the effect of climate change and we are\nSpeaker 10: the last generation who can do something about it. It is sincerely admirable and important that the city of Long Beach is working to draft a climate action and adaptation plan. Of course, the low street of the wetlands will be affected because as sea levels rise, what were once wetlands will be converted into marine environment.\nSpeaker 10: Yet there will be no place for the wetlands to expand because they are hemmed in with housing. And conversely, wetlands are good for mitigating mitigating the impacts of climate change because they can absorb water. I'm here because the low street is wetlands, land trust.\nSpeaker 10: We concur with Long Beach 350 Dawgs recommendations to you. The one I'd like to talk the most about is incorporating the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions and the target date for that emission, we agree, should be sooner should be 2045, which aligns with the goals and the science based policies for the greenhouse gas emissions\nSpeaker 10: included in the Paris Agreement. I understand from talking to the 350 dawg folks that they sent a letter to the council members with these three main points of zero emissions inventory, gas producing facilities, and then also this additional focus and resources for people who are in the most vulnerable parts of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 10: One of the things that struck me because I've been to these hearings is the effect it will have on your vulnerable population and also future generations. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Ms.. LAMB. Next speaker, please. And there are three final speakers.\nSpeaker 12: Hi. My name is Kevin Yeager. I'm a resident of Council District two and a member of the Long Beach Democratic Socialists of America. And we also support the letter of recommendations that Long Beach 350 has put forward. I just wanted to hit on a few points from there.\nSpeaker 12: Mainly the greenhouse gas reduction plan that staff suggest is just out of line with the current science. Unfortunately, the latest IPCC report warns unequivocally that without societal transformation and rapid implementation of ambitious greenhouse gas reduction method measures pathways to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C and achievable.\nSpeaker 12: Sustainable development will be exceedingly difficult, if not possible, to achieve. So we need to decarbonize every sector of our global economy over the next 11 years, not the next 30 years that might be in line with the science five years ago, but it's not in line with the science today.\nSpeaker 12: So Long Beach needs an emergency plan to decarbonize our economy as fast as possible to avoid these catastrophic climate tipping points where it can trigger feedback loops that are become harder and harder to stop or impossible. So laying out multiple greenhouse gas reduction plans and then recommending anything other than the fastest action of those choices is, frankly\nSpeaker 12: , climate denialism lite. And then furthermore, we also need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions at the source. So that means we need to take into account all the fossil fuel extraction happening right here within Long Beach City limits to ignore the extraction that's happening here that goes on to be burned elsewhere.\nSpeaker 12: We're asking the poorest, most disadvantaged residents of south I mean, of central west and north Long Beach to take on the burden of these extreme heat days. Meanwhile, letting other corporations continue to profit off of this extraction, and that's completely unethical and just not going to meet the standards.\nSpeaker 12: So I'll just say that small change, big impact, that's just not true. Small and small change means extinction. We need to be clear eyed of the system change that we need to reach survival and not lie to the public about what will actually save us.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Oh. Summer Hansen from Children's Day, An Earth Day celebration, 25th anniversary. We've been we've been on this path since the very beginning, in 1995. We've always had the very same motto since 1995 till 2019. Our motto is always do something wonderful to make our world a better place.\nSpeaker 6: And Children's Day is a gift that keeps on giving for generations to come. You'll know what your project is. Because you'll feel it in your heart. And my. One of my very best friends. Who is? You know, in her final days said to me yesterday.\nSpeaker 6: Have you solved all the problems in the world yet?\nSpeaker 5: Well.\nSpeaker 6: I mean, we can all have a you know, we all have all these wonderful projects that they're talking about. I mean, and you I know you've been hearing the young people, you know, and and especially Greta. Who is being nominated to get the Nobel Peace Prize.\nSpeaker 6: And I bet you anything. She's going to get it. And the kids are on the. They're on the path. And Edge share a park on April 20th that's going to be us sell a. You know, for Earth Day.\nSpeaker 6: And then the following weekend, it's going to be, you know, the Children's Day celebration. And it's all going to be about the environment. I mean, that's going to be the main, main focus. And that's what we all need to to do in every little thing that is thought of.\nSpeaker 6: It all adds up to. Completely turning everything around. And it's doing good. Is the best friend there is. And so. I know you all have wonderful projects. I hear about them every time I come here. And I'm so proud of all of the things that that you do.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Come on. Let's get with it. Let's all of us together.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Summer, for always promoting Earth Day and Children's Day.\nSpeaker 6: And we need those. And we definitely need those water fountains.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Thank you so much, Summer. Our next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Dave Shukla, resident of the third. As you all know, I've spoken here many times on this issue. The cost of inaction should definitely be calculated. The longer we take to pick an option, the longer we take to get a greenhouse gas inventory to come.\nSpeaker 2: The longer we wait, the more it costs. Equity is built into this in many different ways, not just through the cost of inaction, but also in what ways? Climate crisis. Can be made an opportunity and made an opportunity for jobs.\nSpeaker 2: Councilwoman Gonzalez, you had this great idea of replicating something like Lacey, maybe Labaki or something like that. We could be a leader in transitioning these jobs. We could be a leader in changing how we. Fill our budget. But at some point, the ability to choose for ourselves will be taken from us.\nSpeaker 2: The longer we wait, the more the will get boxed in not only by our own statutory commitments, but by the physics. It's just a reality. It's a reality. It's much more for my life than it is for some some people who are a bit older.\nSpeaker 2: But from the recognition that extreme heat will hit everyone in the city increasingly as it already has, as we've documented over the past ten years, we're going to need bigger, bolder stages of leadership. I mean, option F with a 2045 zero date would be great, 2030 would be even better.\nSpeaker 2: And it's it's not only possible to conceive, but it's possible to implement. The question of who pays should be linked with who'll be benefiting. I mean, ultimately, we, we supplement our and we largely have our budget come from the sales of oil.\nSpeaker 2: What happens when we can't do that anymore?\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Richard. That good? That concludes public comment. I do have some speak. I want to just make a couple of comments and then just to react to some of what was said and have a and then it comes from among us going to be some comments.\nSpeaker 0: So. First, I do think and I'm glad this was mentioned. I think that the 2045 date we have to hit, at a minimum go down to 2045. I think that's been an international standard that's been set. I think some agencies and some some folks are talking about, you know, going earlier than 2045.\nSpeaker 0: And so can I just ask staff to just react to that? Obviously with presented in front of us is a draft and we're not, you know, we're we're moving forward. But is that something that we can do?\nSpeaker 11: So we're taking public input and we're taking direction from this council. We could certainly have a 2045 goal in addition to the 2050 that 2050 comes out of the Air Resources Board. So part of what we're trying to do is be aspirational and lead and be a climate leader.\nSpeaker 11: But part of what we're trying to do is also comply with those mandates that are coming down from Sacramento. So that's where the 2050 number comes from. It's not.\nSpeaker 0: Now, I know it wasn't just pick that out of thin air. I get that. But I also know that the 2045 date is being really pushed by it, by a lot of folks, you know, internationally. And so I think for us to to be a climate leader, to think that 2045 date mix makes sense for for Long\nSpeaker 0: Beach. And so I hope that the Council would support, as we receive it, file this to encourage staff to try to hit the 2045 date as part of this. And so that's going be my first request. The second thing is I do appreciate the comments around ensuring that the resources are going to communities that are disadvantaged.\nSpeaker 0: I think that's when you look at at heat in particular and where that is going to impact the city, it is directly going to impact disadvantaged communities and disadvantaged senior populations especially. And so I think those are issues that I think we have to consider as we move forward.\nSpeaker 0: And then the request and this is really a broader conversation, I think that we have to we have to continue to have but the request to also look at the the emissions that are coming from locally created into the fossil fuels that were that are happening every single day in the city and the inventory around that and\nSpeaker 0: the greenhouse gas emissions, is that something that we're also intending at looking at? And can we look at that?\nSpeaker 11: So, Mr. Mayor and members of the Council, at the request of the public, that analysis is underway. We're having to work with the consultant team to write a methodology in order to do that, because the state guidance says not to do it that way.\nSpeaker 11: So what we will have is two separate inventories, one that meets the state standards, and one that is what the public requested, which is to look at the extraction side rather than the consumption side. And and that work will be complete this summer.\nSpeaker 0: That's that's great. You know, let me just say on this issue, because I think it is to me, it's it's it's the issue of the future when we're talking about issues around climate and climate change and climate justice is it's no secret that the history of Long Beach, it's current funding mechanisms.\nSpeaker 0: And the way we, quite frankly, fund many of the programs that the community enjoy has been through the production of oil. And this is not something that's new or just happened ten years ago. This has been literally how the city was founded.\nSpeaker 0: When you look at when you look at Signal Hill, when you look at Long Beach, when you look at the Tidelands, the port, and what's happened, not just in Long Beach, I mean, this extends out to the Los Angeles patient and the whole San Pedro Basin as well.\nSpeaker 0: And we, I think, have and I and I understand and I think that the the the city, not just this council, but the city has been shy in its reaction and in its approach to having a bigger conversations around oil and its impact on us, on climate and on the bottom line of the city.\nSpeaker 0: And that's a real conversation that that I think we need to have at a more serious and more comprehensive level. I think it's something we've discussed in the past. I know that there's some that would like to change, make changes tomorrow.\nSpeaker 0: And I understand that so much of the city is is connected to this funding mechanism that we have had for such for decades for since the founding of the city. And so I just think that the climate adaptation process that I've been so impressed with, I think you've done our staff and Mr. West, I think you should\nSpeaker 0: commend the entire sustainability team for just the process, the fact that the community's been involved. I think there is an opening to have a positive conversation and a planning conversation around one, how we have this broader conversation around the fossil fuels that we are producing every day and to how long term we continue to operate depending on\nSpeaker 0: a resource that is that is one not not good for the long term life of the planet and our community, but one that that every agency from the state to the country to the city, is focused on trying to diminish its use and what that actually does to impact the parks and the firefighters and the paramedics that\nSpeaker 0: that we are funding with with this resource. And so I would hope that through this. Process in the years ahead that we that we do, we begin to plan and have an honest conversation about where we're going on on this issue.\nSpeaker 0: Even though I know it's a difficult one to have, I think it's one we have to have. And it's and it's time. And so if we can. I'd love to see that incorporated into the community dialog. And I appreciate the work that you guys are doing on that.\nSpeaker 0: So thank you very much. And with that, let me move to Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 10: So my comments will be short. I have to take a quick mommy pumping break and come back so I might not be able to vote on this item, but know that I'm with you in solidarity. I just want to tell you how impressed I am with each and every one of you and how you've interacted with our\nSpeaker 10: offices. I really appreciate the way that you've educated us without really chastising any of our constituents or the way that they feel. And the dialogs, both on Facebook and anywhere else have been very positive. And I really appreciate that a lot of people believe in what you're doing.\nSpeaker 10: I think you've organized well. I think that you brought a lot of important information to the table. And from listening to you today, I took some notes and I'd like to ask that our federal legislative agenda consider supporting some of the items that they've discussed with us tonight.\nSpeaker 10: And so if that could come back through our committee process, I think that that would be great. And I'd love to see some of you attend that meeting. A lot of the work actually gets done at committee. And so we appreciate you coming tonight and being very informative and especially knowing how long our agenda is for taking\nSpeaker 10: the 2 minutes and being precise. So appreciate that. And I want to see what you're talking about come to fruition because it's really important for our children and our children's children. And I'll be back in 15 to 20 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 6: Yes. I want to thank everyone who came and spoke tonight, everyone that's been involved. I want to make sure that I think staff I know that it's been a big lift. And I especially just want to take a moment to thank Mayor Garcia for your leadership.\nSpeaker 6: When I think about eight years ago when I came to council on that side, the leadership to really tackle climate change was was not really here. And so I really want to applaud you for that. And I think that's in response to community groups organizing and educating and really working not only on this issue, but on issues\nSpeaker 6: like community choice aggregation. And so I look forward to working with staff. And again, just want to thank you guys for the work. I know we'll get that meeting in April. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And Councilwoman Gonzales. Yes.\nSpeaker 4: I'll close the loop here by saying also thank you to the organizations LP 350. I was going to say as well, your work with us so many times on community choice aggregation as well as I don't Where's Karen?\nSpeaker 4: There she is. And I remember downtown going dark for about a week and that was really awful for us and having these opportunities to discuss with you. And I look forward to continuing the discussions with each of you on how we can better this plan and make more detailed and more ambitious goals.\nSpeaker 4: I agree. I do remember back in 2014 I actually asked for a report on cap and trade dollars that may be coming back to some of our disadvantaged communities here in Long Beach. I'm wondering if we can dig that out of its grave and bring it back and see.\nSpeaker 4: I know that the state legislature is going back and forth on what defines a disadvantaged community, but it would be really good to get some additional information on that relative to Long Beach and how we can start planning ahead for that.\nSpeaker 4: So that was back in, I want to say, 2014, 2015. That's some time ago. But I would really like us to look at that and bring that back in a two from four or in an additional forum where we can discuss this with with the public.\nSpeaker 4: And I believe I worked with Dean on that. That was a long. Do you remember that? It's a long time ago. So we should do that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Well, thank you very much. And again, thanks to staff. And I know if you keep thinking or sustainability team, but the planning team and the planning department I know are taking the lead on this. So I just I'm looking at the planners over here and I want to also thank our sustainability team because they're doing their work\nSpeaker 0: . You're all working so so thank you. With that that there's a motion to receive and file. But I want to make sure that the motion received properly includes the 2045 target and it and I'm glad that we're already working on the inventory for the city emissions as well on the on the fossil fuels.\nSpeaker 0: And so please cast your votes members on those on that receiving file.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries. Great.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, guys. And I want to thank also just, you know, 350 just for the work. You guys are amazing organizers and you're actually making a real big impact. And so I just want to let you guys know that the volunteer hours and coming to council and sending letters and meeting with members of the council and the\nSpeaker 0: staff, you're actually changing policy by interacting with people and and I believe working in a way that's collaborative. And so just think of just the group and you're certainly impacting the staff in the council. So I appreciate that.\nSpeaker 0: And let me move on to some public comment here. Thank you, guys. So that concludes me close that hearing. And first up, I have is I'm going to have Summer and Jim who are here for the same item come up.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: A public hearing to consider introduction of ordinance amending Chapter 30 of the Alameda Municipal Code the zoning ordinance to streamline permitting for second units. The proposed amendments regarding second units are Statu Tory exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act guideline.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. Go ahead, sir. Members of the council. My name is Sandra Thomas, city planner. I'm going to introduce this item and I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Allen Tai, who's your planning services manager and the expert on second units in Alameda.\nSpeaker 4: All second units go through his shop downstairs at the permit center. The item before you is a recommended amendment to the ordinance that governs second units in Alameda. The book is The Wrong Sequence. There you go. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So it's a first reading of a draft ordinance amendment. This started this conversation started just in September of this year. On the 14th, we took our annual report on the housing element to the planning board. That report was a very extensive report which went through all of the city's ordinances related to housing.\nSpeaker 4: It's something that's mandated by state law that we do it. Our our housing element actually ups the requirement and says that there's a whole number of ordinances we have to we should be looking at to make sure that they're all working as we envisioned.\nSpeaker 4: So we went through and described every single ordinance density bonus, inclusionary many ordinances that the council is very familiar with and had already been improving over the last year. We also touched on the parking ordinance and the secondary unit ordinance and in that review of the secondary unit ordinance, we informed the public and the planning board that\nSpeaker 4: that ordinance is generating very few second units here in Alameda. And in fact, in the last five.\nSpeaker 6: Years we've basically created.\nSpeaker 4: About two secondary units, so less than one a year. And the planning board, knowing what is going on in this community and in terms of the housing shortage, the rent issues that the council struggling with, that the discussions about sort of the missing middle, you know, we're providing some very low and restricted units, but and we're finding\nSpeaker 4: some expensive market rate units. But what about those small units for seniors, for single person households, for people who make enough money so they don't qualify for the very low income but don't make enough money to pay for these very expensive new units that are getting built, that sort of missing middle and the planning board's attitude and\nSpeaker 4: the people, folks who came to the public workshops like yes second unit small little units, those are can fit that gap. We should be doing more than two in five years. So the planning board said, you know what, staff, we want you to put together a draft amendment to see what's wrong with our second unit because it's\nSpeaker 4: an important tool for the council and the community to be using and it doesn't seem to be working. So we came back on September 26 with some adjustments to the code which we think would we hope will generate more second units per year.\nSpeaker 4: Now, you know, we think maybe 10 to 15, maybe 15 in the first year and then sort of leveling out year to year nine, ten, if we're lucky. So it's not a huge amount of housing, but, you know, every little bit helps, especially in this small category.\nSpeaker 4: The planning board held a second hearing to refine the ordinance in November and said, you know what, send this up to council and see if this is something the council is interested in considering. So here we are. Just a little background.\nSpeaker 4: Housing element is your housing element policy. I know you all know this, but for the folks behind me, it sets the city's housing policies. And there's a whole string of policies that really talk about the need for not just affordable housing, but sort of these sort of special needs housing.\nSpeaker 4: Senior housing is something that's been a big priority in the community recently. These are, you know, sometimes called in-law units, granny units. So they sort of serve that kind of population. And, you know, once again, small they're the thing about these, they're rental by law and by our current code, they can't be sold.\nSpeaker 4: These are guaranteed rental units at a small size. You know, and you've been really working hard as a council to deal with the rent crisis, the housing crisis. And there's you've been trying to deal with that complicated situation.\nSpeaker 4: There's a toolbox available to you. You've been spending a lot of time discussing those issues around rent control, around supply. This is just one of those tools in the toolbox. It's not going to solve the housing issue by any means.\nSpeaker 4: It's just one of the tools available to you. The planning board and the staff just believe it's an opportunity for you, if you're interested, to make that tool a little bit more effective, to sort of improve our ability to provide for this sort of niche housing.\nSpeaker 4: So I'm going to now turn it over to Alan, who will take you through the specific changes and a little bit more detail on second units and Alameda. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the Council, L.A. Planning Services Manager.\nSpeaker 4: As Andrew said, I am I am at the permit center. So I do know about the questions that we get at the counter and homeowners that have been coming asking about second units and they walk away when they realize they don't qualify.\nSpeaker 4: And when we talk about second units, we're not just talking about adding another unit to a single family property. It's a very specific category of units that's enabled under state law, and there are many names for it granny units, in-law units, companion units, accessory dwelling units.\nSpeaker 4: They're basically hidden in nature, out of sight, and that's sort of their intent. And they take advantage of surplus space that might be inside a basement or an attic of a home, or they can be in a backyard cottage tucked in the back.\nSpeaker 4: And so for those reasons, they're often regarded as a very good opportunity to accommodate an elderly person, a grandma who might have special needs. But we want her to live independently and yet close in close proximity of the family.\nSpeaker 4: They may also accommodate the adult child who's coming from college and just starting a career and can't afford housing in the same community. Also great housing opportunity for just to accommodate families who want to just grow in place.\nSpeaker 4: The second units are also seen as a sustainable way to add housing. It maximizes the use of existing infrastructure. You don't need new land and it really has a low impact on the neighborhood if if the parameters for the second unit are are here too.\nSpeaker 4: And as Andrew mentioned, they really provide this sort of gap housing for there, not affordable housing in the sense of capital, affordable meeting, the income thresholds. But it really fills the gap, you know, for families who don't who make more more than the threshold to qualify for true affordable housing, but yet can't afford the market rate homes\nSpeaker 4: that the larger developers are building. I'm going to talk a little bit about the state law, because this is important in terms of how we set up our ordinance. The state legislature has long recognized second units as a valuable form of housing and to deal with the housing crisis here in California.\nSpeaker 4: And the first variation of the ordinance dates back to 1982. But the current ordinance, the legislation excuse me, that's in effect, dates back to 2003 with the with AB 1866. And this legislation explicitly sets forth parameters for how cities adopt second units in the process that that it goes through.\nSpeaker 4: For example, it requires local cities in California to process second unit applications ministerial. What that means is you the cities can adopt their checklist of requirements if the application for a permit for a second unit meets all of the checklist requirements.\nSpeaker 4: You have to give them a building permit. So meaning no discretionary review. So what that means, again, is normally here in Alameda, if you add a unit or build a second, a detached structure, you have to go through design review.\nSpeaker 4: There's a public notification component of a ministerial process. There is no public notification. The state law sets forth that the requirements in these second units cannot be arbitrary, excessive or burdensome to the extent that you are generating no units.\nSpeaker 4: You also can't preclude units in specific single family or multifamily zone. So basically the state wants cities to make this happen. And most importantly, the 23 law establishes a statutory exemption under Sequoia. So basically it says that any city that's adopting ordinances to implement second unit law are exempt from having to do environmental impact analysis.\nSpeaker 4: And that's sort of the state's way of dealing with a lot of the not in my backyard opposition that they've seen since 1982. And look, as in many local communities that have been pushing back on second unit. So I'm going to talk a little bit about just the changes that staff is proposing to the second unit ordinance\nSpeaker 4: . In summary, our approach is really a balanced approach. We want to first lower the. We want to first increase the opportunities where we're homeowners. Property owners in Alameda can apply for a second unit. But we also wanted to ensure that the regulations that we're changing or the regulations that would ensure that a second unit would would exist\nSpeaker 4: in harmony with the existing neighborhood are kept in place. And we're also trying to tweak some of the loopholes that are currently in the ordinance. And as Andrew mentioned earlier, we anticipate that changes in the ordinance could generate up to 15 units a year.\nSpeaker 4: And I'll explain a little bit on how we got to that number. This the summary table pretty much shows what changes staff are proposing and what the planning board has recommended. Currently, our ordinance sets a requirement that lots have to be 75,000 of 7500 square feet in size to be eligible for second unit.\nSpeaker 4: There are approximately 400 properties in Alameda that qualify right now under the current ordinance, and we've generated two applications in the past five years. Staff's proposing to lower that threshold to 4000 square feet. And 4000 square feet is essentially the the density that's allowed in Alameda under measure 82,000 square feet per lot.\nSpeaker 4: We think that's that's that's a good threshold to look at. We're also, as I mentioned, trying to fix some of the loopholes and that's where the second row comes into play. Currently, our earnings says that a second unit can have up to 600 square feet of habitable space.\nSpeaker 4: Well, storage areas are not storage rooms are not have little space. And I have seen plans that come in through the counter that show a one bedroom, a habitable area and three other storage rooms that really look like bedrooms.\nSpeaker 4: So. Well, this is a loophole that I can't after the staff report has been published. So I would like counsel direction to close that loophole, maybe with the second reading. One other example of how we would try to amend the ordinance and ensure the keeping of the existing neighborhood character is tying the second unit with the accessory\nSpeaker 4: building regulations in the sister building regulations are specifically written to ensure that the the attached structure matches the main house and that it's small. So currently the second unit ordinance allows second units to be up to two stories tall in the back yard.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, we've heard some concerns about, you know, these structures, you know, changing the character of the single family neighborhoods by tying it to sensory building regulations. We can bring that down to a single story. We're also proposing to modify the parking regulations.\nSpeaker 4: In the next slide, I'll get into some specifics about why we're doing that. But some of the other rules that are in place currently, such as, you know, no separate sale, the second unit will be kept in place.\nSpeaker 4: And we're also going to add the provision that you can't build a second unit and then post it on Airbnb to use as a short term rental. So again, our approach staff's approach is amend the ordinance amendments is really to to.\nSpeaker 4: Loosen up. Kind of the analogous of the spigot. Loosen up the spigot a little bit so we get a trickle of more, you know, the trickle of more units. But at the same time, not not to change all the parameters that would then.\nSpeaker 4: Affect the single family home character.\nSpeaker 0: Before you move on, can you clarify that last point about not being able to use it as a vacation rental? Is that because the purpose of this is to create more housing, not vacation?\nSpeaker 4: Yes. The intent of the ordinance is really to help Alameda families who may have an elderly that they want to have live independently and in close proximity or an adult child. It's not really to provide opportunities for somebody to make a quick buck.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. That's really the staff.\nSpeaker 0: Member, Odie.\nSpeaker 5: So any second units that are in existence today, they could be used as vacation rentals through Airbnb?\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Okay. Because we that provision is not in the current ordinance.\nSpeaker 2: So Ashcroft and Mr. Taylor, you you said that you would explain to us the basis of your estimate that this proposed change could generate up to 15 units applied for in a year. You're still coming to that?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, I will get to that.\nSpeaker 0: All right. I'll wait. Number.\nSpeaker 6: So for the 707,500 threshold, which we want to change to 4000 square feet with a 7500 square feet threshold, there was roughly if I heard you write it, you say.\nSpeaker 4: 400, 400 eligible.\nSpeaker 6: Eligible lots. So how about for the 4000 square feet?\nSpeaker 4: 4000. There there would be 3900 3900. In addition.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: BRODY So going back to your can you go back a couple of slides to the. That one right there. So is our current ordinance in compliance with the state law?\nSpeaker 4: Yes. So we've met the letter of the law of the state law in providing a second unit ordinance. Is now. Do we deserve a passing grade? I would say no. I mean, essentially using the same analogy, if the state law requires you to have a spigot, we built the spigot, but we didn't necessarily turn it on or\nSpeaker 4: we did enough to have two drops, two units.\nSpeaker 5: So we're still in compliance today. I mean, we're not.\nSpeaker 0: We know we're.\nSpeaker 4: Not. We're. Right.\nSpeaker 5: Any state law. And then on the on this count, does this and count include the units at in Harbor Bay that have cars that prevent second units? No. Our plan is just to continue to exclude those or.\nSpeaker 4: Well, those those properties are in a planned development. And so I think even if we look at the topography of those neighborhoods and how those lots are situated, built, it's it's I would assume it'd be very difficult for those homes to get in the second unit unless they have to really carve out or create internal units.\nSpeaker 5: And are we talking about internal second units or external or both?\nSpeaker 4: Both. The ordinance allows both. And we propose to continue to allow both types of units.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I may have more later, but.\nSpeaker 4: Remember in the Harvard bases in ours, I believe preclude second units.\nSpeaker 6: When you talk about internal second units, are we talking about situations where people raise their homes and then have the bottom home as a completely.\nSpeaker 4: Attached versus detached? Detached units are often in the basement or in an attic.\nSpeaker 6: That they raised they can raise.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Mm hmm. But if somebody raises at home, it would be subject to design, review and all the design guidelines. And if it's an older home, a Victorian.\nSpeaker 6: But that would be considered a second unit within the meaning of of what we're deciding tonight.\nSpeaker 4: That potentially.\nSpeaker 3: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 5: All right.\nSpeaker 0: Another one. And then Brody.\nSpeaker 5: But if we do have an older Victorian home, there's I mean, what you're asking us to do is to allow an internal unit to be added to that home. So basically making that a multi-unit home.\nSpeaker 4: The current ordinance already allows that.\nSpeaker 5: It does? Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 4: Current ordinance. I mean, just to be clear.\nSpeaker 5: Well, under over 1700 feet.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 5: Now we're adding 3500 more possible older units on the main island, zero on Bay Farm that can be eligible to be subdivided. Right.\nSpeaker 4: Well, not subdivide it.\nSpeaker 5: Well, maybe we'll send a single family home into a multi-family home.\nSpeaker 4: Into a multi-unit.\nSpeaker 3: In a mayor.\nSpeaker 0: And vice mayor.\nSpeaker 3: I don't believe it's zero on Bay Farm. It's, it's there's the ones in.\nSpeaker 5: The Bay Farm portion. Yes. Old Harbor Observer.\nSpeaker 4: Suburb. Correct.\nSpeaker 2: That that was my comment to.\nSpeaker 0: You may continue. All right.\nSpeaker 4: Excellent, Andrew. So the previous slide or that summary table or basically all of the checklist requirements that somebody has to satisfy in order to obtain a second unit permit ministerial. But of all of those different standards, parking, as you may know, is really the number one key that we have over over development.\nSpeaker 4: And you've probably seen this with other projects where parking you can if you relax the parking enough, you can get more units. If you tighten the parking controls and make it very stiff, you you would basically eliminate that possibility.\nSpeaker 4: And I think the current ordinance as under scenario A over here on my left requires that a property with a second unit provide three parking spaces. So it's the two plus one, two parking spaces for the main dwelling, and you have to add one independent space for the second unit.\nSpeaker 4: Obviously very few Alameda properties can will have the space to accommodate that. And then if you look at the diagram too, it also is the scenario where it takes up or it adds the most paving to a lot.\nSpeaker 4: And you know, the homeowners would really have to make a choice even if even if they have the space to accommodate all of the spaces and the driveways, they are giving up a lot of yard space. The staff recommendation was really to relax that rule a little bit and just to say, hey, if you have a single\nSpeaker 4: family lot that currently has two parking spaces, you may accommodate a second unit by assigning one of those two spaces to the second unit. But the two parking spaces has to be independently accessible. The Planning Board concurred with staff on relaxing the parking rule, but they recognize that most Alameda properties simply just have a long driveway on\nSpeaker 4: the side. There's not a whole lot of space in the yard to create a whole parking area. And so they actually recommended that the ordinance be revised to allow two spaces, but that they can be in tandem. So.\nSpeaker 4: And the reason for the staff recommendation to not go with Tandem is this concern that, hey, you know what, if if I do rent my second unit out to a tenant, would I then have to knock on their door and move their car?\nSpeaker 4: And and there's this fear that that car might just end up on the street. So but that's kind of the explain the three scenarios. And and this is very key in terms of whether our second unit ordinance would be effective in generating units will literally come down to how we treat the parking.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, large size, you could set the lot size zero. But if, if, if the lot is not configured to meet the parking requirement, the second unit is really out of the equation.\nSpeaker 0: Before you move on. Actually, could you go back to the planning board or do you or is there any way to, you know, enforce that the parking that driveway would be used for the two, two cars, assuming at least two cars.\nSpeaker 0: Right. As opposed to having a car end up on the street.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. That's that's that's not enforceable. Even currently when we review project plans and to verify for compliance with the parking ordinance, I mean, this is a behavior issue. We can only regulate it so far as that. The plans demonstrate they have the space to accommodate the parking, but there's no enforcement over whether somebody uses their garage for\nSpeaker 4: parking versus storage. That's really what it comes down to, a behavioral issue.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So what does this all of these amendments mean? And because Almeida hasn't had a very successful track record and we really have no data. The city of Santa Cruz is really a good case study for us to look at.\nSpeaker 4: And and not only because its population size is very similar to Alameda and they're also dealing with similar housing issues as we are. I mean, I think I've read about only 7% of Santa Cruz residents can actually afford to live in Santa Cruz.\nSpeaker 4: And so they're also running into a huge housing crisis. But the Santa Cruz ordinance is also an award winning ordinance, second unit ordinance, because it's very bold and it really goes out of their way to incentivize second units.\nSpeaker 4: They make 18,000 of their lots eligible for second units. They have a minimum lot size of a requirement of 5000. But again, the large size is really contingent upon the local topography. They allow second units to have two stories.\nSpeaker 4: They allowed second units to be two bedrooms, while the Alameda current audience is one bedroom. They allow ten in parking spaces and they incentivize. Second units by waving permit fees for homeowners who choose to put a cap on their rent.\nSpeaker 4: And so this this is a way to ensure affordability.\nSpeaker 6: So it's a good idea.\nSpeaker 3: And.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, Vice.\nSpeaker 5: Mayor.\nSpeaker 3: I didn't read any anything that even approached that in our ordinance. Yet our driver here, at least in half, when you look at at the findings and the goals was to provide affordable housing and even gap housing. Is there a reason we didn't put any incentive to grant basically a value to the property owner in exchange for\nSpeaker 3: a a deed restricted similar to a developer affordable unit or even a gap housing unit.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. That's certainly something that we can look at. But don't don't forget that with any sort of administration of a cap or a restriction, there has to be monitoring. And the administration of Santa Cruz has a program where they monitor and they have staff that does compliance reporting.\nSpeaker 4: And I think we need to be careful, too, because it also. Requiring a deed restriction. And Andrew reporting on homeowner of single units of a second unit. Maybe that one that they want to create for their grandma. But but with potential in the future as rent, rental or income generating property, it might be seen as a disincentive\nSpeaker 4: that it's adding another stipulation to all of the.\nSpeaker 3: Well, I think we can discuss that, but I wanted to raise that. It's not in here at this moment.\nSpeaker 4: It's not in there.\nSpeaker 3: Santa Cruz has it. And we actually do this with large developments when they're just bigger. Right. So we can.\nSpeaker 4: Discuss the number one center.\nSpeaker 3: I didn't read anything miss anything in here when I read it. Correct.\nSpeaker 0: You and Brody?\nSpeaker 5: I didn't see that. And they were there. But doesn't also doesn't Piedmont also have a similar types of, of, of registration requirements and certification number?\nSpeaker 2: Ashcraft So Mr. Ty, you've made some distinctions between what Santa Cruz does and what Alameda is perhaps currently equipped to do. But you did start out by saying that the Santa Cruz second unit ordinance is a good example for us.\nSpeaker 2: So what in particular should we take is as something to replicate?\nSpeaker 4: Well, I think what we take away from this is to recognize that this is the nationally recognized model ordinance. They're going all out to encourage second units. And at the end of the day, they generate an average of 17 units per year.\nSpeaker 4: So I know.\nSpeaker 3: Where we want to be.\nSpeaker 4: Sort of where we want to be. And you know, again, this is a program that's putting a lot of effort in promoting second units. They even hire architects to draw up prototype plans. And so when homeowners come in, they can point to a menu of second units that they want, point to that one, and they can get\nSpeaker 4: their permit. Staff isn't proposing that we're going that far. But, you know, even a program like Santa Cruz is generating 17 units a year.\nSpeaker 2: And I think you mentioned that there's some sort of an oversight board that oversees or assures compliance. Do you know possibly how that is funded in Santa Cruz?\nSpeaker 4: I think they have some outside funding source. I've read about it, too, but it it is. Staff intensive to have similar programs, a program where you administer. I mean, for us to do that, I think we have to bring in the housing authority to to monitor as part of the affordable health unit.\nSpeaker 2: Bringing them pretty severely now. But outside funding sources maybe.\nSpeaker 0: In.\nSpeaker 4: Piedmont there. I believe they're Rina. The regional housing needs allocation is less than 20 units. So to have them monitors, 22nd units might not be a big deal. But.\nSpeaker 0: Can you clarify the rent cap? Does that interpret to affordable housing?\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Specifically for Santa Cruz, it's tied to the incomes associated with low and very low income.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, and just last question. Is there a period of time that that rent cap is in place?\nSpeaker 4: No.\nSpeaker 2: So it could just be one year to get the permit fee waived and then it could go.\nSpeaker 4: Up right up until the unit is removed.\nSpeaker 0: As long as the unit is there.\nSpeaker 4: Then as long as.\nSpeaker 3: The unit.\nSpeaker 4: Is there, then.\nSpeaker 0: The indefinite.\nSpeaker 4: Rent cap applies.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, so.\nSpeaker 4: It's permanent as long as the unit exists.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So next slide. So SAFF is recommending approval of these amendments as recommended by the planning board. But we also like the council to direct us to pilot really pilot the program for a year. Let's see what how many units we get and be able to identify the issues if there are any issues and then come back in\nSpeaker 4: a year with some results and a recommendation. Again, this is exactly analogous to a spigot. We are proposing to turn it, you know, a few degrees. And if if, you know, suddenly we're getting too many units, we can come back and adjust those requirements as needed.\nSpeaker 4: And staff will be monitoring the number of applications during this time. And the public will also have real time access through a via the city website on the number of second unit applications that come in. That concludes my presentation.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Member remember?\nSpeaker 6: Great. On the matter of piloting, what's the mechanism of that you envision? Do might we ever pass this ordinance with a sunset clause or at which point when it sunsets, then we re re-up it or not? Or do you have other kind of mechanisms in mind when it when it comes to piloting?\nSpeaker 4: Mm hmm. Yeah. I think Andrew mentioned earlier that our plan is to analyze the effects of the second, you know, ordinance as part of the annual housing element update. So that's something that we do every year. The council can direct staff to come back in a year with with a public hearing on an on another zoning text\nSpeaker 4: amendment to and that allows the council to open up the ordinance at that time.\nSpeaker 0: With a member.\nSpeaker 6: On the housing element matter. I saw within the annual report just within one of the boxes. I think it might have been table B, I can't remember one passing reference to second units. It was within the context of above moderate income.\nSpeaker 6: I don't think a table A or table C or any other ones had any references to it. So do we as a city obtain any benefits by having second units in the housing element? I mean, is it specifically prescribed as an and as in matter in and of itself, or is it prescribed if we do second units\nSpeaker 6: within the context of affordability?\nSpeaker 4: Right. So any unit generated in the city of Alameda will count towards the arena allocation. Okay. This the second unit ordinance as it's set up now, does not benefit the affordable criteria because they're not deed restricted. I should be affordable.\nSpeaker 4: Now, if we amend the ordinance to require that we restrict certain units, then we can count those towards the affordable.\nSpeaker 6: Last thing. I did see the reference to the city of Piedmont and I followed that up. Just looking at it the way that Piedmont looks like they do it is they have they incentivize people for a period of ten years.\nSpeaker 6: So it is something to be considered. I'm thinking about the relationship between affordable, narrowly defined and the second unit ordinance.\nSpeaker 0: And we do have six speakers. Nebraska.\nSpeaker 2: It's a very clarification question. So can you tell us what you based your estimate of the number of of applications per year on?\nSpeaker 4: Right. So basically. Right. Basically, we looked at Santa Cruz. I mean, they went all out and they still got six, 17 units. When you look at Alameda, is numbers 400 units, less than half of a percent are or is currently what we're getting now with the two units.\nSpeaker 4: And so if we made the number of eligible lots up to 3900. Half of 1% is about 3050. I mean, that's sort of the ballpark. 1% is about 30 units and half of that would be 15 units. And and that's also supplemented by, you know, we track just the number of customer inquiries at the permit center.\nSpeaker 4: And I would say annually we probably have about ten or 15 customers that come in asking about the second unit ordinance because they probably know a family member in the city who's gotten a second unit. And so they come in and so about on average, we get about 10 to 15 inquiries about second unit.\nSpeaker 4: So I think that's reflective of the actual demand here in the city.\nSpeaker 6: And one last question, at least for me, is this will this mostly occur in our one's own neighborhoods?\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 4: And sort of the explanation for that is in the ATA and other multifamily zoning districts, you don't have the same restrictions that you have on second units. You can have a bigger second unit, you know? Right.\nSpeaker 0: Can you explain what the R-1.\nSpeaker 4: Is or what is the single family residence zoning district? They are two would be the two family residence zoning district.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And we have six. If you do want to speak on this item, please turn in your sleep and I'm going to start calling them. You'll have 3 minutes. Alvin Lough. Steve aced and then Doyle's a sailor.\nSpeaker 0: And. A pause, a few moments.\nSpeaker 4: Hi, everyone. My name is Alvin and good evening, everyone, and happy holiday. I am military support to second unit. The reason is I, you know, I'm a high tech person. I work in sales. And my wife in San Francisco and I took it.\nSpeaker 4: And one is about 11 and one is eight. And right now we are living very small unit and in the land is bigger. And we basically I live with my mom, too. My mom is helping me a lot.\nSpeaker 4: The reason you say we know what keenly you know about it, it's half is a lot. You go to I go to San Jose area to work and my wife's to San Francisco. So the profit actually take us like very long and lucky I got my mom and how me do you take care to keep okay and\nSpeaker 4: and they sample to care from the school back to home and cooking the food for my my to keep. The problem is I my my my wife and my mom always have arguing and I'm a the both of you guys need to know that, you know, it's a man I need to work very hard for support my\nSpeaker 4: my job and then I middle income me to support go to work it to make sure my boss happy okay I mean and work hard and make it longer. And I need to make sure my mom happy too, because you you're not cops.\nSpeaker 4: You are not even I know heavy and my way of you know when you had a nighttime you just say in a your mom say something I supposed to be doing that you know, cooking for the food and your mom saying is such that like, well, I need to cooking like this way and I have a my\nSpeaker 4: way to do it and kind of leave a high for me when I go home. Very tired in the work, you know, waiting for my boss. Give me all the job and go home and my, my, my, my way.\nSpeaker 4: Just arguing about, you know, different things. And I feel that easier for me to handle my case, I think is a better ATC is a better to have a different kitchen.\nSpeaker 2: Are you getting moved to the second unit?\nSpeaker 3: I will never be to the.\nSpeaker 4: Is I feel is like kind of like a hard time you know for for me is I to a thing about it and tonight you're always in the back saying oh well we might say something and then I mean my way I mean kind of the way my my have time meet me and just saying they they\nSpeaker 4: taught me about like that too so I pity support the second you only because to say to lady like to have their own way like take care of kids sometime have our own way to doing something so I kind of privacy for though too so and then like I my mom is only one son I have we\nSpeaker 4: have a very strong culture is as a son take care of the family especially the mom and dad so so I'm much more honest with you and I tried to pay for a lot for senior house for my mom, too, but it's a very difficult I think, you know, that is not enough senior housing for everyone, you\nSpeaker 4: know, in that area. And then like one thing, he's not only my mom take care of my family sometimes I feel is I need to take care of my mom, too, because they are older.\nSpeaker 3: So. Anyway. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Steve aced.\nSpeaker 5: I'm here to speak in favor of the amendment to the ordinance. I'm Doyle Siler. I'm with renewed hope and Madam Mayor and members of the City Council. I'm glad to see the attention given to the secondary units. Granny Flats won't solve our affordable housing crisis.\nSpeaker 5: We can use a variety of approaches, though, to show we want answers. We need to take seriously. First time buyers can't afford market rate cost. This barrier to owning a house. Crowds The rental market and unwillingness to meet Alameda needs has to be shown to our citizens.\nSpeaker 5: The law calls. Calls, secondary units. Granny flats. State law allows for families to live here intact. State law requires we meet affordable housing goals. You hold the keys to creating affordable housing. All in Alameda is watching what you will do to make this housing crisis come to a happy end.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. From renewed hope.\nSpeaker 0: Steve asked. And then Dennis Owens and then Bill Smith. And our last speaker on the issue would be Jim Smallman. Let's you have a slip. Please turn it in. Go ahead, Steve. Hi.\nSpeaker 5: I wanted to point out that some of the slides that were shown tonight are slightly misleading. One of the units in the first picture wouldn't qualify for your ordinance. You've got. I believe the number and the count or number of units that we have in town in the R-1 zone was 3900.\nSpeaker 5: Is that right? And they're going to get 17 units per year out of that. We're set. Santa Cruz is 1800 units and they get 15. So they're going to do. Four times as well as Santa Cruz is the supposition here.\nSpeaker 5: My concern primarily, however, is that the. Presentation that's been given to us doesn't really give the owners in this zone adequate notice of what's going on and that we're. I am. Want to put something on the front of my house?\nSpeaker 5: I have to public notice it and send out all sorts of notices. And it's not happening with this and it's a bigger deal. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor and city council. I'm Dennis Owens. I'm an architect. I'm also the chair of the Alameda Historic Advisory Board, and I'm in favor of this ordinance. I have a son, two stepchildren. I see their friends and they with the various problems they have.\nSpeaker 4: Finding adequate housing in Alameda and in Oakland. And I think this could be a step that would help alleviate some of the housing shortages that are in Alameda. I'm sharing the optimism that staff has that it could produce 15 or so units a year.\nSpeaker 4: I applaud the decision to consider them as accessory structures and also with the use of the tandem parking space by having them considered as accessory structures. And with the tandem parking space, I think you'll get a lot better designs than you would if you actually start to require fully accessible parking.\nSpeaker 3: With the parking.\nSpeaker 4: Apron and all the square footage of additional pavement that you would be placing on the site by having the the driveway, you know, serve as the primary parking area. You have a lot of better choices as an architect where to put the the secondary unit.\nSpeaker 3: To make it fit in well with the.\nSpeaker 4: Neighborhood. If you're forced to put the parking in as fully accessible parking, you're you become quite limited because that really drives where where the remaining location for the secondary units is going to be. I would suggest that a limit for a new structure be 700 square feet or 10% of the lot area, whichever is smaller.\nSpeaker 4: I think a 700.\nSpeaker 3: Square foot unit on a 4000 square foot lot might be a little.\nSpeaker 4: A little bit too large for most most neighborhoods. And, you know, I think that it will would be something that, you know, could be. Very well fitting in with the you know neighboring properties and in the city has good design guidelines and a good design review with staff and with various appeals that are allowed.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Bill Smith. And then Jim Smallman and I don't have any other speaker tips on this.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the council and staff. I'm Bill Smith and I just want to thank the staff and the and the planning board and others for conducting the housing review this year and taking action on it.\nSpeaker 5: It's a small item, as we heard from Goyle, but we also heard from another speaker that this with the with the arguing women in the House, it's it's a way to save a marriage maybe, and lots of lots of other advantages to it as well.\nSpeaker 5: It's not a large number, so I don't think it would be huge problems with parking. It will definitely be an inconvenience for maybe one or two more cars on the streets every now and then. But it's going to be gradually increasing over time.\nSpeaker 5: So it's not not a big not a big issue, too, for people to adopt to. And I think we definitely we will see more and more of the younger people going without cars and looking for places to live without cars.\nSpeaker 5: So I don't see that being an issue. And certainly the Chairman Historical Advisory Board made a very good, strong case for allowing tandem parking in there. So I support that as well. I wanted to make one other unit in terms of I saw a number and in the correspondence people said they wanted to see affordable, affordable restrictions\nSpeaker 5: placed on these units as a long time affordable housing activist. I don't think the number of units we get out of this and we have a secondary units could afford. You can really justify paying for a large regulatory structure to monitor and enforce that.\nSpeaker 5: And I well in time made a good example of that when you talked about with the Santa Cruz and what they've done for that. I think we do it just under the regular housing, in the regular housing and do it under that rather than a separate.\nSpeaker 5: Separate would be fine. So let's focus on getting it done for all of the properties and and not to not take a look at break out this one separately for affordable housing restrictions. Thank you all. And I look forward to this passing.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Jim Smallman. He's our last speaker on this item.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for having me. I'm representing the Alameda Architectural Preservation Society tonight, and surprisingly enough, people seem to be surprised that we were supporting in general this this proposal. We would support a program. We do support a program that would lead to affordable housing.\nSpeaker 5: And some people seem to be surprised by that. But I think it's an appropriate position for us to take on planning. Staff is advised, as you heard earlier, that the second unit ordinance that we have now has not worked well and and clearly it hasn't.\nSpeaker 5: And they supply one reason for it that it was limited to 7500 square foot lots. And that may contribute to it. But but those of us who have been involved in construction think that that another issue is the cost of a second unit.\nSpeaker 5: I mean, you you you put requirements in this ordinance for underground utilities. Obviously, you're building a separate building. So you've got a new foundation. You've got a roof structure that has to be built. You have four walls that have to be built.\nSpeaker 5: The architectural detailing has to match the house. And there's a lot of issues with that. I mean, I just restored a house by taking stucco off the outside of a Victorian built in 1890. Would I have had to put stucco on the auxiliary building to make it match what was not original?\nSpeaker 5: There's details and issues with some of this that I think need to be worked out. I think the real issue is that the second units as separate buildings are just too expensive. It's going to be very difficult to make that affordable housing.\nSpeaker 5: And so what's going to happen is they'll they'll doll them up, they'll make beautiful garden apartments and there'll be rented for $3,000 a month. And that's I don't think what you really want to accomplish with this. Our our approach, at least within the architecture that we represent, there's a ton of new foundations being put in, replacing the\nSpeaker 5: brick foundations. And now, I mean, it's done all over town. I've done two in the last six years. When you do the foundation work, a lot of what you have to have to have a second unit is already done.\nSpeaker 5: You don't have to do the exterior detail here. You're living within an existing envelope of the building. The the interior walls are are are minor costs compared to the to the rest of it. You get less cost for the electrical and so on.\nSpeaker 5: So that's a suggestion that that we make it's not so much that we oppose this ordinance, but the emphasis, even in the pictures, in the presentations made tonight, were separate buildings. And we would like to see dig outs or an adjustment where you have a ground floor unit.\nSpeaker 5: And I think that would solve a lot of the issues and make the resulting units more affordable. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right. He was our last speaker and also comments we'd like to start.\nSpeaker 5: Anywhere.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, I. I'd like to look at this. And in my way of thinking it. I think there's enough adjustment here that. It. It may need to have more detail, put in more planning board review. There is the primary issue that I'd like to do is if we're going to be granting a significant benefit or significant value to\nSpeaker 3: the property. I'd like to be able to get some some return, and that return would be to the goal that was stated to have affordable units. So I'd like to see some incentive, some here way that meets that goal.\nSpeaker 3: What that is. I'm not an expert in this. It's complicated. There's a cost of doing business, but that was mentioned. But I'd like to have some incentive written into this ordinance that says if you do this. Well, if you provide us with an affordable unit will allow you some some additional concession that is described in an ordinance\nSpeaker 3: for a second unit. And I'd also like to have the analysis of what it really costs to administer these, because if we looked at this as the the ten or 12 that we're likely to get as ten or 12 large developments, we still have to monitor them.\nSpeaker 3: We have to monitor Del Monte, we have to monitor Alameda Point, we have to monitor Clement everywhere, every one of these large developments that's building affordable units. We have to monitor at some point is going to become mechanized.\nSpeaker 3: So I dispute that it costs. Something that's horrendous, that's untenable until I see the data. The second question that I would like to see addressed is the distinction between or some description or or outlining of the difference between expanded family and putting something on the market as a rental unit, because those are two different things.\nSpeaker 3: The where you have an in-law unit, where it's a family member or returning child, there's those are different than us providing another rental unit. And I think that needs to be addressed a. I'd also like to see a definition in here of what a second unit is and make the distinction between a second unit within the envelope\nSpeaker 3: of a building and a second unit as an accessory building. Because it's not. It's not it's not clearly written, at least to my to my read on this. And the last there's a there say other terms that are qualified like the term on page three where it says short term rental.\nSpeaker 3: Well, what is a short term rental? Do we have a definition for that? And then lastly, I'd like to see some ordinance language. Or some attention and another vehicle. It doesn't belong here on legalizing accessory buildings, and that includes non-conforming buildings that are currently used for residential use.\nSpeaker 3: So those are my comments on this.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Before we continue, we have one more speaker slip. I'm sorry. Is that all right with council to go ahead and finish this one. Christopher Buckley.\nSpeaker 5: Christopher Buckley with the Alameda Architectural Preservation Society. I wanted to thank you very much for taking me out of order. I was trying to watch this on the webcast, and the webcast didn't show up until about 10 minutes ago.\nSpeaker 5: And I saw Dennis Owens addressing the council. I figured, oh, I better get here. So if you could have somebody, whoever's running the webcast to make sure this doesn't happen in the future would be good. So we sent you a letter.\nSpeaker 5: I believe you all have a copy of that, and I'd like to walk you through some of the points. And I hope this isn't too repetitive, since maybe this has already been talked about. We'd like to commend the city for trying to find creative ways of addressing the current housing issues.\nSpeaker 5: And this proposed amendment has potential to do that. But we think it's being rushed through without adequate analysis and could have unintended consequences and might not be very effective in achieving its purpose, one of its purposes to try to provide more affordable housing, which is mentioned repeatedly in the staff report and also in the ordinance preamble.\nSpeaker 5: So we're asking that the consideration of this ordinance amendment is deferred until adequate analysis is performed. And also we included in our letter three possible amendments that we would like to have considered. Our two main concerns are the reduction of the minimum of the lot size 7500 square feet to 4000.\nSpeaker 5: This would effectively convert the R-1 zone to a kind of mini duplex zone. And by our accounts, which we got from staff, maybe staff updated these counters. They didn't hear the staff report. But it looks like at least 3900 lots could be eligible for second units potentially over time.\nSpeaker 5: That would suggest thousands of additional units in the city with potential impacts on traffic, impervious, surface conversion and and other parameters. And we think that needs to be analyzed in conjunction with the other housing units that are in the pipeline.\nSpeaker 5: The second concern is allowing second units to be within accessory structures within required rear yard areas. And we're concerned that's going to lead to removal of landscaping and also conversion of pervious surfaces and impervious surfaces running low on time here.\nSpeaker 5: So I'm going to skip through some of this. There's two questions that we asked be pose the city attorney. First, item nine on page three of our letter concerning secret status. We question those exempt as statutory and categorical exemptions.\nSpeaker 5: We'd like to hear the city attorney affirm that those are appropriate and ten also affirming that Harbor Bay would be exempt from those because of their sex and ours. There's a there's perhaps another 4500 units in our bay that would be eligible.\nSpeaker 5: Can I recite our three amendments? Requested amendments. I'm running out of time.\nSpeaker 0: Quickly, if you could. Quickly.\nSpeaker 5: Our proposed suggested changes are one, require second units to be affordable in order to be buy. Right. Second, to require a use permit or other discretionary approval for. We're saying 7500 square feet or lots. So it could be a smaller threshold, but that would help address the impervious surface traffic impacts of the things on a case by\nSpeaker 5: case basis. And third, to require that second units be within the existing building envelope to qualify for buy. Right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I remember already.\nSpeaker 5: Thinking about him. Can I just ask two more questions of staff? So again, going back to the Harbor Bay Bay Firm, 94502 group. So how many are one units out or lots out there would be eligible that are not exempt either because because of their cars or their while.\nSpeaker 5: Our two obviously is not about.\nSpeaker 4: 4200.\nSpeaker 5: Or 200 on Bay Farm.\nSpeaker 4: On Harbor Bay.\nSpeaker 5: If we if we adopt the ordinance as you propose it, how many lots on Bay Farm are we talking about? Other 3900. How many would be eligible to be included in this second unit ordinance? Do we know that number?\nSpeaker 4: I don't have that right on top of my head. We can get that number. But I would say roughly around 200. It's it's the old the old Bay Farm Island.\nSpeaker 5: I think would be kind of small. So we're basically talking about, you know, 90, 95%.\nSpeaker 4: And within that area, not all of the lots are zoned. R one There are other lots with other stipulations and some lots already have multiple units on them. So the number of really truly eligible lots are actually a very few number.\nSpeaker 5: I guess my point is this is the bulk of this. Almost all of this is going to be on the main mainline. So that's correct. Impact. Mm hmm. Okay. And I thought I had a second question, but I don't think I did.\nSpeaker 5: I'm sorry. Remember? I don't know. Well, I'm still kind of.\nSpeaker 0: Going over.\nSpeaker 5: Comment, so you don't have to stand up for my comments. Thanks. I kind of echo a lot of what the vice mayor had to say that, well, I think this is a good idea in principle. I think it does need a little bit more work.\nSpeaker 5: I do kind of sympathize with the comments made by Mr. Smallman and Mr. Buckley and about the affordable housing. You know, Piedmont has a program we saw in the stat presentation. Santa Cruz has a program. We say this is something we want to use as a tool to address affordable housing, but we don't really do anything in\nSpeaker 5: the ordinance to actually guarantee that it's going to. So I hope that well, I would have prefer that this comes back to council with a little more meat to it, especially on the on the affordable housing. And, you know, the market is going to be what the market is.\nSpeaker 5: And if you build, you know, a very nice studio cottage in the back of your apartment or in the back of your lot, you are going to have increased value. I mean, not only will you have increased value of your property, you have the potential rental stream.\nSpeaker 5: So when you go out to sell it, you'll make more money. So, you know, we're giving a big benefit to homeowners without asking them to do what we think we're asking them to do, which is make these more affordable.\nSpeaker 5: So I'd like to see some more teeth and actually some more maybe some specific program. I am concerned. I mean, the staff have. We you say you want to have more of these. I mean, what's the number you think you want to have?\nSpeaker 5: I mean, is it 100?\nSpeaker 4: No, no. We think two in five years is not enough. We think you could we can do better. We are you know, we keep emphasizing this idea. We have to monitor this every year anyway. So, you know, if if there is a.\nSpeaker 4: So far, nobody has stepped forward and said that there's a magic number that's too much. But our feeling is we're going to we have to report every year how it's going. So we see a built in opportunity for the council to each year go, okay, you know what?\nSpeaker 4: That's feeling like too much or we've had issues and we can document it. What kinds of units have been approved in whether it was the parking that made a difference or the lot size the it gives you puts you in the opportunity to control this program every single year and adjust it.\nSpeaker 4: And what what Alan was talking about in response to Councilmember De Sykes question is, you could direct us, so to say, basically put this on the agenda in one year as a zoning amendment. We're not telling you to turn it down or up at that point, but we want the opportunity to make that adjustment.\nSpeaker 4: And staff at the staff report, when you come back in a year, tell us give us all the data. What happened in the last 12 months? How many did you prove? What kind, what you get? Do you have any ideas about what could be better?\nSpeaker 4: Check in with plenty more quickly, see what they think, and then put us in the position to make an adjustment.\nSpeaker 5: I guess my concern is if we open the floodgates and we all of a sudden have 100 applications in the first two months, then it may be something, you know, that we really haven't in. There's a lot of impacts to 100 new units being added on the main island.\nSpeaker 4: You can absolutely. I would agree with you. And I think if that's something, that's something you could definitely tell us. You could say, look, you know what? If in the first three months you get 100 applications, we want that hearing immediately.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. So I'd like, you know, see in in a revised ordinance, you know, that we have some some cap that if it reaches that number, you come back to us and say it's this is what's going on, because, you know, we all know the impacts.\nSpeaker 5: And I really don't like the idea of just giving carte blanche, you know, all the way down to 4000 in the proposal in the a piece that the used permanent other discretionary planning permit for second units on lots than 7500.\nSpeaker 5: So is there a way we can that's what we have my I think my colleagues agree that you know this 4 to 7000 7500 window that maybe we add a little more scrutiny to that because what I am concerned about is that we start breaking up these old historic homes and now they all suddenly become multi-unit homes\nSpeaker 5: . And, you know, that happens at a faster pace than anybody. Yeah.\nSpeaker 4: Just just to clarify for the public and for the council, the APS suggestion about discretionary review for anything less than 7500. That's what's on the books today. So that's that's okay. That's that's that's got the spigot closed tight today.\nSpeaker 4: That's why we are suggesting now. But if you're thinking we need we've went too far down, let us know.\nSpeaker 5: Well, especially on the parking, because you know that that picture you showed I kind of agree with I don't members one of our colleagues or somebody on staff you know on the far right, if you have ten in parking and you're the one that's.\nSpeaker 5: In front or in back, you know, you're going to be forced into the street. And I know that that's a big concern everywhere in Alameda. And I don't know if we can afford because we're basically going to say, well, we have a unit that we have two spaces and now we're adding a second unit.\nSpeaker 5: But, you know, we're taking we're basically taking the space away. And if we make a tandem, it seems like we're actually taking two spaces away because we should have three, right? If you put a second unit.\nSpeaker 4: That the three the diagram on the left is the current.\nSpeaker 5: Rules today. Right.\nSpeaker 4: So that's those are the requirements today if you want to build a second unit.\nSpeaker 5: So yeah, you're reducing parking not only to two, but I think in reality it's going to be closer to one because if you block that that front car in, you know, in practice, people are just going to if the driveway is full, you're either going out of courtesy of your neighbor, you know, or your landlord, you know\nSpeaker 5: , not park in the driveway and then. You know, I think some more consideration should be given to the apps there. Their third proposal, which was to require units of less than 7500 to have their additional units inside the main building.\nSpeaker 5: You know, consider that we're losing. What do they call it here? They called it impervious surfaces and vegetation removal. You know, I think if we add more asphalt and and structure to these smaller units, you know, I'm not sure that that's something I think that needs a little bit more analysis and a little bit more community input\nSpeaker 5: on. So I hope that you can go back and take this. If my colleagues agree that go back and, you know, amend this ordinance and and consider those three items or four items.\nSpeaker 4: If staff and make a clarifying comment on the reason why we're proposing to tie the second unit ordinance with this Ussery building regulations. Again, we recognize that a lot of single family lots have an existing accessory building right now.\nSpeaker 4: The ordinance prevents you from using that building as a second unit. And so the goal to tie the two is to encourage the reuse of existing buildings for a second unit so that you don't have to pave over more yard or build new structures.\nSpeaker 4: So I just want to.\nSpeaker 5: Clarify that.\nSpeaker 0: Member.\nSpeaker 2: Clarifying question while we have you, Mr. Ty. There's been some reference to concern with losing impervious surfaces from adding parking, but is there not some percentage of.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. So the current ordinance stipulates that when you add a second unit, all of the entire lot area that's not covered with either building footprint or driveway space cannot be 60% of the lot. So that's going to stay in place.\nSpeaker 4: And so, again, owners who are property owners who want a second unit are going to have to meet that entire checklist if they want the unit buy. Right.\nSpeaker 5: But if it's 100% covered today and it drops down to 60, then we're still losing.\nSpeaker 4: No, no, no. They would have to comply that we're not changing the coverage requirement and we're not proposing to change that. And in fact, somebody who has a single family home and is not even proposing second unit, they can cover more of that lot today.\nSpeaker 4: So if you want to do a second unit, we're actually providing an additional restriction on how much you can pave over because of this whole parking question. So. You know, but once again, yeah, the spigot it analogy it's really we're looking for the council.\nSpeaker 4: Tell us, you know, what information you need to move forward and how much or how little you want to open the spigot. Understanding that can also put you in the position to monitor it very closely and schedule an adjustment at whatever point you think is necessary.\nSpeaker 4: There's one more important fact that I forgot to include in my presentation. Apologize is that the term trend in Alameda is in the last five years we've lost about 23 units, the investors in older Victorians in purchasing them.\nSpeaker 4: And these are Victorians that were previously converted to multi-unit. They're converting them back to single family homes. And so, um, you know, we've generated two single second units in the last five years, but at the same period we've lost 23 units through the restoration of these Victorians.\nSpeaker 4: So and that's been a trend. I mean, we see more customers at the counter asking to remove units and restoring Victorians and we are getting inquiries for second units.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. You can sit down. Thank you, Mayor Spencer. So we heard Andrew Thomas start this presentation and we read it in the staff report that tells us that this proposed ordinance would give us another tool in our tool kit, the tool kit that council can use to address the rental housing shortage.\nSpeaker 2: And I suspect I speak for all of my colleagues when I say we've all been grappling with this for weeks and having lots and lots of meetings to look at all different sides of this issue. So our rental housing shortage certainly is a need for more affordable, but it's a need for more market rate units, too.\nSpeaker 2: And any additional rental units will help alleviate the stress on the system. Right now that we have a 2.7% vacancy rate, which is very low currently, I don't see the need to differentiate in this ordinance between a family member living in that second unit or an unrelated renter, because I think both types of units have value.\nSpeaker 2: Alvin, the speaker that we had, I thought, illustrated very, very sweetly the the benefit of having your mother there. But you need to keep your wife happy, too, I'll hasten to say that. But but I'm a mom, too.\nSpeaker 2: And I want my son to think like you when when I'm older. But so there's that value. And I have friends who have grandma living in a second unit on the property. And it's lovely for the children to go across the yard and spend time with her.\nSpeaker 2: And it's probably lovely for her to go have some peace and quiet too. On the other hand, we have renters who who need places to live. I do think I think the vice mayor mentioned it in it's in the Santa Cruz ordinance that we could incentivize if you wanted to do that cap on rents and make it\nSpeaker 2: affordable, we should be able to come up with an incentive to do that. And again, I would let the market guide this. As Mr. Smallman said, there's a cost to adding second units. So that's one of the reasons I don't see the floodgates opening because I think that, you know, you don't go into this sort of thing\nSpeaker 2: lightly. But on the other hand, you might have a carriage house, a garage or whatever that could be converted. I also don't see the need to limit second units to only dig outs or ground floor units. And we heard some concern expressed on this council with what that might do to our historic Victorians, turning them into apartments\nSpeaker 2: . I think it's an option if somebody wants to do that, have the second unit in their basement, on their premises. But if they have the space and wanted to do it separately, I'm sure there's value for that too.\nSpeaker 2: I was taken with Mr. Owens, Dennis Owen's suggestion that perhaps a 700 square foot minimum allowable unit size is too big for some properties. I would have a hard time saying you couldn't do this on a 4000 square foot lot because that is what what we allow 2000 square feet for a dwelling unit.\nSpeaker 2: But I think there's value to considering that 700 square feet or 10%, which ever is is the lesser amount. And I. As far as the argument that when you sell this property to which you've paid money but added value to your property, you will benefit from a higher selling price.\nSpeaker 2: The city will too, because we get that transfer tax so the city will have have benefit. But I think at the end of the day, this is going to be a valuable asset. Maybe not huge. I suspect we'll we'll start slowly.\nSpeaker 2: But I very much support the idea of doing the pilot for one year and we can have a trigger point if we were to get more than so many applications in a given months, quarter of a year, what have you, that could trigger a review.\nSpeaker 2: But what I would like to see is, if at all possible for this council tonight to work out some amendments we'd like to see to this ordinance so that. Well, let me just check with city attorney before I go too far out on that limb.\nSpeaker 2: If we were to add some modifications to the proposed ordinance, would it still qualify as a second reading or does that start over? No.\nSpeaker 0: No, really. Only some minor modifications can be done between first and second reading. So depending on what exactly you're talking about modifying. My guess is it probably would have to start over with the first reading.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And so I would just say that. Again, we're looking for solutions for ways to address a problem that is significant as far as this rental housing crisis. So whatever we can do to not keep delaying, availing ourselves of those tools.\nSpeaker 2: I think we should do so. Those are my views. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de Days.\nSpeaker 6: Well, thank you very much. What interests me the most is seeing a stronger and clearer connection with affordable housing narrowly understood affordable housing, particularly for low income and moderate income households. A variety of places have mechanisms to incentivize that when it comes to the second units.\nSpeaker 6: You saw that tonight in the case of us, a city of Santa Cruz which waived fees to the extent that people make a commitment to make the housing affordable. I think you also heard it indirectly tonight in the case of the city of Piedmont, which had wave, I believe, parking requirements to some extent in exchange for a\nSpeaker 6: ten year commitment to affordable housing. I think it's important for the city hall to make the clear connection with any kind of housing project or development and and affordability, because I think for far too long we've been kind of assuming that, well, if you build it, you know, they will come.\nSpeaker 6: Meaning if you increase the supply of housing, that somehow, you know, through the wonders of the way that the market works, the demand, especially from the lower income and moderate income households, will be satisfied. You know, the fact of the matter is trickle down didn't work in the 1980s with Reagan and trickle down housing policy isn't working\nSpeaker 6: now. So I do believe that we have to have a clearer connection in this case or in other matters. For example, if we're going to deal with dealing with the housing project contiguous to the El Monte project, we need to make a clear connection between the project and its social obligations.\nSpeaker 6: If nothing else, especially now as we are amidst this crisis going on now for 14 months. I think that's a signal that we need to send with this with this second unit project, let that people know that that we're going to alter our our rules with regard to second units, but also let people know that the benefits\nSpeaker 6: of this will accrue to partly to moderate income and low income households. And that is the intended purpose. I would also say that, you know, if you're going to do that, incentivize senior housing as well, because clearly from the BP report that was provided several meetings ago, you know, senior housing, you know, because of their constrained income\nSpeaker 6: , they're really at risk here. So I do think that we need to send it back to city staff to to look at ways to making the connection with affordable housing clearer and stronger. One other item I, I do need to get a little bit more information on is the having the second unit.\nSpeaker 6: Built below instances where we're raising a house so that we can build some kind of second unit, separate unit underneath. And I need to raise that because in the mid 1990s there was a real big outcry here in the city of Alameda about what was then referred to as infill housing, largely on the grounds of its effects\nSpeaker 6: , as some had thought on the character of neighborhoods. Meaning you have a certain character of a house that's, you know, maybe just one stories tall, but then suddenly, you know, when it's two stories tall, it might have lost that character.\nSpeaker 6: And in the context of the R-1 neighborhood, that's something that we need to think about. So in closing, my thoughts about this subject is I do think we ought to send it back to the planning board or city staff for further consideration on the connection between housing affordability and and the second unit.\nSpeaker 6: I like the idea of piloting this for a while to see how it goes. And and my concern is, you know, I do want to have the concern about the second unit and within the main house evaluated more.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: And member Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I forgot to. I was trying to be succinct, but I did want to comment on parking. I think some good observations were made with both between the staff recommendations of independent spaces, the planning board recommendations of the two tandem spaces.\nSpeaker 2: I. I would come down in favor of staff's recommendation for the two independent spaces, because I feel that that gives there less likelihood of that scenario of someone just being so frustrated that, Oh, you're parked behind me and now I'm going to park in the street.\nSpeaker 2: So from there it's still up there. From the drawing above, you could see that both automobiles could get out independently. So that would be my recommendation. And we also do know that statistically smaller households and seniors and folks with lower incomes don't tend to drive as many vehicles.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm comfortable with the two independent spaces. Thank you, Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: You're welcome. All right. So I agree with many of the comments that we heard this evening from the public as well as council members in regards to. Dennis Owens. I think he made a good comment in regards to 700 square feet for the second unit or 10% of the parcel, whichever is smaller.\nSpeaker 0: The parking that Member Ashcraft just spoke to. I. I. I support the current, which is three spaces. However, I would be agreeable to going to the to independent. And I see. That that would be something I would be willing to compromise on in order to incentivize the units and make them more actually make it easier to do\nSpeaker 0: units for family members or affordable housing as opposed to market rate. And to me, supporting a family member, whether it's an adult child or someone who's older, they probably would not be paying market rent so that you're not having someone make whatever that number that is.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm just going to say 3000 a month or whatever it is, I don't know. But market rate, if someone is actually receiving income of market rate, then I think that they should have to have as little impact as possible on the neighbors, whereas if someone is accommodating their family or doing affordable, offering more affordable units, then\nSpeaker 0: I'm willing to have more impact on the neighborhood, which would then, I think, be this staff's recommendation of the two independent spaces. I'm very concerned about the two tandem spaces because I really think in reality you're going to have one car park there and at least one, if not to or even three cars parked on the street\nSpeaker 0: . And I do receive complaints. Regarding a shortage of parking. And I really think it's throughout the city, not just one area. So and I see that as a real concern for other people in the neighborhood. Another the other issues that were raised by a piece or the legal opinions on the questions, nine and ten, if you could\nSpeaker 0: , that could be addressed when this comes back. I would prefer that this come back to council as opposed to the planning board because I think it would be able to expedite it then. And I think I agree with member Ashcraft of the goal.\nSpeaker 0: Sounds like all of us are agreeable to that, having it come back to council to try to expedite this. I like some of these changes. Now, staff was going from minimum size 7500 to 4000. I see that as a big jump and and I would prefer loosing in that some for market rate but not that much.\nSpeaker 0: I think if you're going to get to the 4000 that again that that's tied to your affordable or your family members and I would think maybe 5000 or even 5500 if it's going to be a market rate unit.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. The one story I support having it be the one story that was in the staff recommendation. The minimum distance to the main house. Changing that from 20 feet to six feet. Could someone explain why that's being suggested?\nSpeaker 0: All right. The minimum distance from main house currently is 20 feet and it's been the stats recommending.\nSpeaker 4: So really the 20 foot setback that's required between the main house and the second unit really is difficult to accommodate because you also have a front setback of 20 feet. You have the main house, another 20 feet in between the two houses and then a rear setback of 20 feet.\nSpeaker 4: Not many properties in Alameda can meet that. So and again, the second the accessory building regulations stipulate six feet and that's in alignment with the fire and safety codes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I would I'm agreeable to that. My question then is or I have a question with surrounding neighbors received notice of this proposal. And I would think that they should if it's if if it is a if if we're loosening the requirements, if they're following under the current requirements, then that's fine.\nSpeaker 0: However, you currently do it, if we're making it easier to do it, then I would want notice to the neighbors to be able to really share how they think it's going to impact them.\nSpeaker 4: So I think the council needs to decide which checklists. So basically under state law, the checklist is what allows you to have something by right. Ministerial process means no neighbor notification. Now, under the current ordinance, the requirements that we have now, if you meet them, you qualify for the ministerial process.\nSpeaker 4: If you don't meet them, you can apply for a use permit and that has a notification. And so I think the Council can decide what parameters qualify for the by rate checklist.\nSpeaker 0: And so for me, if we're going to be reducing the number of spaces required for parking. From the 3 to 2. I would like the neighbors to be able to weigh in on that, because there are some neighborhoods that there is no parking right now.\nSpeaker 0: And I think that someone needs to be able to take that into consideration.\nSpeaker 4: So that would be just that would be no change to the current ordinance.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. In regards to that issue. Regards to that issue. And now Piedmont has four or five different forms where you check different boxes depending upon. And and that makes sense to me because then it tells you clearly where you're falling and what the requirement is.\nSpeaker 0: So I think more work needs to be done to make it easier and clear for the applicant. So I like the way Piedmont does it. I also appreciate the way Santa Cruz does in regards to incentivizing for the low and very low income.\nSpeaker 0: And I do support the proposition of offering more units for low and very low income. But with that then, is greater impact on the neighborhood. So then I think the trade is that the neighbors should have an opportunity to share if they if they have concerns.\nSpeaker 0: And then the deed restriction, if we're if of the city's offering these concessions to allow the affordable or house housing for a family member, then I think that there should be a deed restriction in perpetuity as opposed to just ten years.\nSpeaker 0: If they want to come back and change it to a market rate unit, then I think that then they should have to go back and figure out additional parking or whatever, the nuances that work when we're making concessions to encourage affordable housing.\nSpeaker 0: And that's what it should be affordable or family member, but not market rate. When we if the homeowner then decides they want to switch it to a market rate. And I think that they should have to. Add the additional parking or whatever the concession is that we're offering.\nSpeaker 2: Can I just ask you, Mary Spencer? So did I understand you to say that you were recommending a deed restriction in perpetuity for a family member living? No.\nSpeaker 0: Not for a family member or affordable. Okay. I mean, I actually. So I'm not sure. Well, and if I was lumping those together.\nSpeaker 2: So here's why. As opposed to market rate. Okay. So here's why I would have concern with the into perpetuity for a family member. That means that rents with the land and even if the unit is the house with the second unit is sold, it would require the subsequent buyer to get a family member or.\nSpeaker 0: Affordable housing then or affordable housing as opposed to market.\nSpeaker 2: We should probably hear from the city attorney.\nSpeaker 0: Just for a clarification, you can't limit it to family members. It's not legal or affordable. Affordable. You can limit it, but you can't limit it. So a family member, though, would not be my my guess is that they would not be paying market rate and then it would fall under affordable.\nSpeaker 0: Is that is there a way to do that so that your family member read it and you just can't limit it to a family member? So if we can get member, we.\nSpeaker 5: Incentivize family members and then like eliminate those incentives when the family doesn't live there.\nSpeaker 4: I think you've given us a lot of very good ideas. I am sensing that we, Alan and I know where you want to go with this. We have to do some analysis. We have to look at the monitoring issues, the costs.\nSpeaker 4: We have to figure out a way to create incentives to get affordable guaranteed. But, you know, we also have to.\nSpeaker 2: Stay within the law.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, within. Exactly. And there's just a number of of associated issues. We just need to I think we need to analyze. We have to prepare a report bring back to you. I think we're going to come pretty close.\nSpeaker 4: I guess what I'm curious about is first, how's the counsel? Want to handle the process?\nSpeaker 0: And then I'd like. Well, I.\nSpeaker 1: Would I'd like one clarification. I think I'm hearing the council say that they're okay with potentially having some affordable and some market rate. But just that if you have the market rate, you have to meet some higher threshold.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I just want to make sure everybody's okay.\nSpeaker 2: And did that make.\nSpeaker 0: Sense to you?\nSpeaker 2: That was what I wanted to ask you, too. So on your parking and the neighbors weighing in on parking, is that only if it's for a market rate unit? Because do you really do we really want to subject affordable housing to being turned down by the neighbors?\nSpeaker 2: Maybe that was what you said, that you so have a different standard. Okay. What did you say?\nSpeaker 0: I don't think I said that. Even Mary, I appreciate the. Thank you. But I do want to have that discussion in regards to when do we have notice to the neighbors? Because if we're making but I'm going to say are significant changes to the current regulations and then we would end up with an impact on the neighbors\nSpeaker 0: . That's I think we have to discuss what notice when would the neighbors have notice? Just vice mayor.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm hearing in the aggregate. Enough. Changes to what what is presented tonight to say that we're going to have another ordinance come back for a first reading, right. As and it's going to include the given. It's going to include issues of incentivizing affordability, because that's one of our major goals.\nSpeaker 3: It's going to have examination of the parking and when that's noticed and when it's not. And I sense a preference for the independent spaces versus attendant tandem spaces. And then there were a a number of other suggestions of modeling the Piedmont format that is used for the checklist.\nSpeaker 3: And then the question of what is buy right versus what is buy use permits, right? I think those are the big issues that I've heard.\nSpeaker 2: And I think everybody's comments.\nSpeaker 3: And then there's a number of individual comments that.\nSpeaker 1: We have no consensus on.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. And those, I think are staff report ones where you have to come back and say why you chose not to put it in or and why you chose to incorporate it. And then we're going to have this discussion again.\nSpeaker 3: And I think I heard that come back to council, not back to the planning board.\nSpeaker 0: All of us agreed to that. And that's considered.\nSpeaker 2: Expedited for the reasons you stated.\nSpeaker 0: Yes, we.\nSpeaker 5: Need a motion.\nSpeaker 0: And one area that I don't think any of us discussed was private use of second unit as a vacation rental. And and I support and I support that because of the impact on the neighborhood again. And I don't think it goes to our goal of adding housing, permanent housing, and so did it.\nSpeaker 0: Did anyone have a concern with that?\nSpeaker 2: No, I think we we heard and think maybe it was the vice mayor in the beginning said that or somebody said you might want to define what that vacation rental means, you know, for so many days, short term rent.\nSpeaker 2: However, we are defining a short term rental. Yes.\nSpeaker 5: I mean, my only problem with that is where, you know, these other second units that we've already approved do not have that restriction. And, you know, if we're going to come back with a second I'm sorry, an Airbnb or short term rental regulation, you know?\nSpeaker 5: You know, maybe we can do that. You know, temporarily. You know, and then have it superseded by some mail.\nSpeaker 3: Well.\nSpeaker 2: I remember Ashcroft, what I was going to say to that is when we got the the report on the rentals, the the state of the rental housing market in Alameda, I do remember that there is at this point, a fairly small percentage of units that are being used for Airbnb.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm satisfied with moving forward with that restriction in this ordinance. And if we see it becoming a problem in the rest of Alameda and of course those aren't second units, people often just rent their home out or a room in their house or something.\nSpeaker 2: If we see that becoming a problem, we can deal with that. I don't think it needs to hold us back from moving forward on this one now.\nSpeaker 0: And I think you may want to keep your current or just, you know, maybe we could have different models if you did the current with all that, then you can keep using it because it currently doesn't have that restriction.\nSpeaker 0: If you satisfy everything, it's only if you want to then take advantage of these fewer restrictions that you would fall under. I. I see another category of market rate that then is restricted in regards to not being able to be used as a vacation rental.\nSpeaker 0: And then another category that would be for affordable and family members.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, well, my viewpoint on vacation rentals is that the nature of this ordinance in its preliminary language is to address the partially addressed the lack of permanent housing or families and other in specific categories persons of very low or low income households.\nSpeaker 6: Or even so, it's to provide a new stream of permanent, affordable housing in terms of vacation rentals. Down the path, you know, five years down the road, ten years down the road, I don't know, maybe the baby that might maybe that might that issue might arise for.\nSpeaker 6: Or any new stock of housing that comes out of this. But I think for now, that's an issue that's down the road with regard to people right now who provide vacation rentals within Alameda, who are following the rules and doing that, they're doing that.\nSpeaker 6: And I think the message ought to be that this isn't taking away their right to do what they're doing right now, although we will be discussing that further, more down the future. But nonetheless, this is a needed ordinance because we need a different stream of permanent housing stock that addresses specifically and strongly various needs within our stream\nSpeaker 6: of demand in the city of Alameda.\nSpeaker 0: Ashcroft.\nSpeaker 2: What we're saying is, would you like a motion.\nSpeaker 0: That would you like a motion or do you think you have sufficient direction? You know.\nSpeaker 1: I think we have direction.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, good.\nSpeaker 0: All right. All right. Thank you, sir. We're going to take a short recess now.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Did you. Did you fetch them?\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Are they fetched?\nSpeaker 3: Right.\nSpeaker 0: I think it's. Are you ready? Mm hmm. All right, we're going to resume. Finish up your comments, please. Thank you. All right. So we are now going to resume.

        "source": "Speaker 1: Communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Councilmember Urunga. Councilmember Richardson. Recommendation to request the city attorney to draft a resolution in support of comprehensive immigration reform.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I want to first thank everyone for their patience, Rousey said. Although Supersu Paciencia. I'd first like to hear from the. I know everybody has been waiting a long time, so I'd like to first hear from the public.\nSpeaker 0: Public comment, please. But so you don't wanna make a motion or anything you want and then hears from the public. Did you make them? Okay, so we have a motion on the floor in a second. We'll take public comment on the item.\nSpeaker 0: Please line up. You want to do public comment?\nSpeaker 4: I'm Robert. I'm Robert Lawton. I think you're. You're. You're you're. Today's resolution on immigration reform should be tabled a, b, b before you is a letter from the organization called Flush the TPP dot org. The title of the of the of the letter is stop.\nSpeaker 4: The Trans-Pacific Partnership is I'm sorry, stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership is immigration rights. This week or next week, Congress will be voting on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Congress will not be voting on comprehensive immigration reform until 2006. Today's resolution should be titled It Should Be Tabled A simple and example of us.\nSpeaker 4: A simple resolution from the US, from the City of Long Beach would be the city of Long Beach. City Council is urging Congress to vote no on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And then you could say more information from Citizen Dawg.\nSpeaker 4: In their letter, they point out that the event in 2005, there was a study for the Mexican government by the World Bank that showed rural, rural, rural poverty had risen from 35% between 1992 and 1994. 1994 was when they passed Neurath American Free Trade Agreement, and by 1994, by 1996, it had rid the urban rural poverty had\nSpeaker 4: been risen had risen to 55%. By 2010, 53 million Mexicans were living in poverty, or half the population at 20%, mostly in rural areas, lived in extreme poverty. Now, after the free trade agreement of NAFTA destroyed jobs on both sides of the border, and then the Trans-Pacific Partnership is now the on steroids.\nSpeaker 4: And in the end, it is it it's going to create more poverty in in Mexico and and more of a border surge. And then then, then and then according to this, they have some statistics on the people who die in the desert, a very painful death trying to sneak into the country.\nSpeaker 4: And so so so is so when you consider that they're so so that there should be a statement about stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: All right, good. You. Clarke has the address. Let me before expressing my view on immigration specifically, let me say I was at the Council, the Board of Supervisors meeting last month, which was referenced by earlier speakers today. And I was there when they personally witnessed three of the fifth columnists.\nSpeaker 3: Give the middle finger not only to ices, to not only to ice, but rather to the families whose family members had recently been slaughtered. By the recently released. Illegals in this country. The only action this council should take is one that would support the type of conduct.\nSpeaker 3: The George W Bush unfortunately did not had the guts to do the manifest. So enamored was he by his nanny. And to do what Eisenhower did back in the fifties, which is the use of the United States federal troops.\nSpeaker 3: To round up every single person in this country that is here illegally. Marched them back to the country from which they came. And in addition. Take them to the American consulate or embassy. Take them to the end of the line.\nSpeaker 3: Are those people that have been standing in line. Figuratively and literally. And have those people explain to them why they should be able to cut. Into the line and not wait their turn. The only people that could support that are the cells of fifth columnists that are in fact as dangerous to this republic.\nSpeaker 3: As is ICE's. Period. Who want to change the basic foundation of this country. And that's exactly what the people. The 3/5 columnists. And the Board of Supervisors did. And any person that supports anything other than marching them back.\nSpeaker 3: And having them get in line. It's just like somebody coming here and trying to cut in the head out of the line and saying, No, I want to speak. Follow the law. The law should apply to everybody. The only thing you should applaud again is using federal troops.\nSpeaker 3: Round up all the illegals. Send them back to the country from which they came. Have them get in line like everybody else.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Next speaker. Yes. I wonder, Bashar, again, I think passing this resolution is a grave mistake for one, as I mentioned earlier tonight. Your job is to protect US citizens allowing illegals to come in here and steal our jobs, dilute our quality of life.\nSpeaker 4: It's not protecting us. It is damaging us. Which you should be focused on the homeless, the unemployed, the veterans who are suffering, not people who come into this country as thieves and steal what's not theirs. I'm a veteran.\nSpeaker 4: My dad was better in two wars. I have a I have I have two sons. I've got a vested interest in my country. For you to come out and say that you're going to pass this resolution. When if you look back at the Immigration Act of 1986.\nSpeaker 4: We had all kinds of of guarantees. And what did it do? Nothing. It failed. In 1965, there was an immigration act. Where we were, where we were going to not destroy this culture in this nation. What did it do?\nSpeaker 4: It failed. And now you. City council members of Long Beach. You want to take it upon yourself to do something in this little town which the federal government has failed time after time to to to solve. And you want to make it even worse.\nSpeaker 4: You want to take it upon yourself. To take back door. Some kind of right to somebody that's not not here legally and should not be here legally. They should not be here at all. It should be like the gentleman said before, said home, we are a nation of laws.\nSpeaker 4: You cannot allow illegal people to come in and destroy. Like Ann Colter said last week or this week on Bill Maher's program. Does The Invisible Man, Invisible Man, you believe in Jesus Christ does. What does he think about her book, Adios, America?\nSpeaker 4: She said, Yeah, no, look, Jesus agrees with this totally. If I see a homeless man on the street, I have to take him home and put him in my bed. This is my home. This is our home. This is where children live.\nSpeaker 4: When we grow up, we expect to have a life. A freedom. And we went through a whole Cold War dealing with freedom and trying to make people free. And that's the important. That's what made the United States the greatest nation in the history of mankind.\nSpeaker 4: Frankly, sir, we don't want to destroy that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Excuse me.\nSpeaker 0: Excuse me. Before you get started here.\nSpeaker 3: Is anyone else getting in.\nSpeaker 4: Line up there? Because I'd like to get a consensus. Are we? Okay. Thank you. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. My name is Javelina Ramirez. I'm live at the district number six. I want to talk a little bit about me. I have been in this country for 26 years. I have three kids, 24, 20 and 18 years old.\nSpeaker 1: My kids, the older one, is a medical assistant. The second one is in his third grade at the Long Beach. The other one was a SEP that I, UC Santa Barbara has been volunteer for the last 20 years in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: I has been volunteer with the children's clinic. When I was Barney Lowenthal at the Fourth District, I was helping there and I was helping the part of the Drake Park. I was involved with some other organizations. Many of you know me for a long time, and that has been in this country.\nSpeaker 1: Like I said before, more than 24, 24 years. And I'm an American undocumented in this country. But I can tell you, I has been doing more things in this country. That many others that they call themselves citizens. I has been working in my communities really hard.\nSpeaker 1: I has been volunteer. I don't get it any money for that. My job is being a caregiver. I has been taking care of elderly people. I have to shower them. I have to change Pampers. I have to fit in them.\nSpeaker 1: I have to do all the those kind of chaps. I am by you. Those people who don't like me or who don't like us Latinos here and United States on the comment that I buy them to change number to another people.\nSpeaker 1: I would like to see them doing that kind of job. But I feel really proud to be here to had my three kids, citizen, three of them, and they are ready to vote. My daughter is 18 already. She I know the other two has been worried.\nSpeaker 1: My my daughter's is ready to vote in that I don't go to anywhere. I'm open to helping my community. I want to continue being here. Say. I don't know if you guys are going to like or not, but it is what I want to do, and that's why I am here.\nSpeaker 1: At this moment, I have to run to get my job because I make my job and I turi pm and thank you so much for listen to me.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening, Honorable Council members and staff. My name is Laurel Almonte and I'm the district director for Congresswoman Janice Hahn. Congresswoman commends a Long Beach City Council as you consider adopting a resolution in support of President Barack Obama's executive action and comprehensive immigration reform.\nSpeaker 7: Congresswoman Hahn strongly urges the city council to adopt Councilwoman Lynn Gonzalez's resolution that is before you tonight. Our country was founded by immigrants, and throughout our nation's history, immigrants have made significant contributions in every sense. We in California have the country's largest immigrant population.\nSpeaker 7: We embrace the differences of our residents and with it the wonderful variety of the many cultures that make Long Beach, the second most diverse city in the United States, for way too long. Our current immigration system hasn't been working to the benefit of our country.\nSpeaker 7: There are approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and as you noted, 900,000 make Los Angeles County their home the most in all of California. There have been more than 2 million deportations since 2008 separating families, leaving children behind without one or both parents.\nSpeaker 7: And this is just not right. Our immigration policies should reflect our family values and keep families intact. And that is what the president's executive action daka and DAPA do. Congresswoman is pleased that the city of Long Beach previously adopted a resolution in 2010 in support of the Federal Dream Act.\nSpeaker 7: The City of Long Beach continues to demonstrate the civil rights and human rights are democratic principles in the congresswoman urges this body, the Long Beach City Council, to vote in support of council woman's resolution. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: When I started this. Good afternoon. Honorable, honorable mayor and city council members. Mia. Mr. Bell, my name is goodbye. I live in the sixth district, so partly I'm part of many community groups, equally Zionist and coalition such as?\nSpeaker 1: I go along with Jimmy Barnett's coalition. I have lived for ten years here in Long Beach. I'm with you that I love this multi-colored and multicultural city. LDA There you stood up today on advocating and searching for Una for your Local four part local support in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: Mantilla My area. So the majority of us know that executive actions that extended indirect, such as extended DOCA and upper extent imposed are being held at our ports. Is the situation in this situation is harming and creating an environment filled with frustration and a sense of false credibility for millions of people.\nSpeaker 1: Nor soon segreto can we be living in a non and the non anonymous do you know sexism against people with power and personal skills and support there who seek to rob and exploit us. Also, Antarctica signals the racism by using racist tactics.\nSpeaker 1: But our continuous support in order to continue to separate families in the negation of basic services is one party in mistrust, which are part of creating a sense of security in this country. Nosotros Then in Moscow, S.A. you have this that we must sit down and discuss this topic apparently in the very other sitting not at all\nSpeaker 1: that involves basic human services, independent responsibility that can not be denied by anyone. It is our responsibility that new generations, new voting generations, no san contaminados por la, but are not compelled by those people think without compassion and those filled with ignorance, the names of the heroes whose bodies we must protect the parents, amigos, vecinos, my siblings\nSpeaker 1: , friends and neighbors. But we must inform them that our work, they involve civic communities that involves community and city matters. But is our responsibility for the benefit of our country? Look, we are seeking we are seeking and asking some guarantees.\nSpeaker 1: The apology about will not be the guarantee for equality and peace. E-Passport on Mistral for our children. It still seems that I love where they come. This will grant us the confidence and strength necessary. But in order to systematically advocate in a manner that benefits everyone, yes, continue.\nSpeaker 1: And continuing to strengthen our economy, economy, social, our economy and social health. But I conclude to conclude clearly manana. If tomorrow El Dorado were to become law, I would not qualify Yuka. So I am a mother of two immigrant daughters.\nSpeaker 1: Maya More yet my love for this city immigrant and my sense of civic duty may ask me to stand here today supporting the new generation of voters such as my grandchildren, my vecinos, my neighbors. Give me some eagles and my friends.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much for your time. Good evening.\nSpeaker 5: Vice Mayor and council members. My name is Marisol Barajas. I'm District Director for assembly member Patrick O'Donnell, and I'm accompanied here by my colleague.\nSpeaker 2: Alyson Gallagher as well. We're here to speak on his behalf to thank you all for having our office here today.\nSpeaker 5: And on behalf of the ASM Assembly member, I'd.\nSpeaker 2: Also like to express our appreciation to Councilmember Gonzalez for introducing this important resolution. As a.\nSpeaker 1: Classroom teacher with over 20.\nSpeaker 2: Years of experience, the Assembly member has witnessed.\nSpeaker 5: Firsthand the shortcomings of our country's.\nSpeaker 2: Immigration system, and the toy can take on undocumented students who want nothing more than to pursue a better life through education.\nSpeaker 5: He understands ensuring California's.\nSpeaker 2: Dreamers are empowered with the knowledge and skills they need to achieve their career goals ultimately benefits us all, and that these education opportunities have far reaching positive impacts on every facet of our society, from public.\nSpeaker 1: Safety.\nSpeaker 2: To economic growth. So once again, thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez, for your tremendous advocacy and for giving us this chance to voice our collaborative support for this comprehensive immigration.\nSpeaker 5: Reform, but most importantly, for the families and advocates that are here tonight.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Good evening, council members. Thank you, council member Gonzalez, for introducing this immigration reform resolution. My name is Sulley Sara, and I'm here on behalf of Senator Ricardo Lara to support the resolution, which will benefit not only Latinos, but also Cambodians, Filipinos and Pacific Islander immigrants throughout Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: It's no secret that California is leading the way.\nSpeaker 5: On.\nSpeaker 1: Immigration reform, and Senator Lata is proud to see that the largest city in his district, Long Beach, is eager to lead in this.\nSpeaker 5: Regard as well.\nSpeaker 6: 1/2, please. Hold on 1/2. I'm going to be very clear and I'll say this once. We will be respectful of all speakers. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. We know that undocumented immigrants comprise nearly 10% of the state's workforce, contributing to a $130 billion annually to our state's gross domestic product. That's billion, not millions, and generating 2.2 billion in state and local taxes in 2010 alone.\nSpeaker 1: As most of you are well aware, Senator Lara is a champion for the immigrant community. He is the proud author of SB four The Health for All Act, which ensures that California expand access to health care for our most vulnerable communities.\nSpeaker 1: He is also the author of SB ten. The Office of New Americans, which will serve as a central resource agency within the Governor's Office for Undocumented Communities throughout the state. In closing, Senator Lara congratulates the City of Long Beach on your effort in the fight towards inclusion and equality for every Californians.\nSpeaker 1: And he wholeheartedly supports this resolution. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. My name is Brant, whereas I am a field representative and deputy press secretary for Congressman Alan Lowenthal. And unfortunately, he he couldn't be here today, but he asked me to read a statement on his behalf. I am here to support and thank Council member Linda Gonzalez for taking the lead and introduce her resolution supporting the\nSpeaker 1: president's executive actions on immigration. As many of you might know, I have worked very closely with the Long Beach Immigrants Rights Coalition, Echo and other local organizations advocating for immigration reform. As a matter of fact, one of my first events in the district during my freshman term was an immigration reform roundtable where I discussed with advocacy groups\nSpeaker 1: the importance of Congress taking action on the broken immigration system. I recently held a DAPA informational event in partnership with Long Beach Immigrants Rights Coalition, the Filipino Migrant Center and the Office of Council Member Robert Turanga. During my time in Congress, I have strongly supported comprehensive immigration reform that would provide a pathway to citizenship while securing our\nSpeaker 1: borders and fixing our broken immigration system. While the Senate passed a bipartisan bill by wide margins in 2013, the House leadership failed to even call a vote, though this bill would pass with support from both parties. While Congress has refused to act, millions of families across our country, California and my district, have live under the threat of\nSpeaker 1: deportation. I have repeatedly urged the president to use his authority and protect families until Congress passes immigration reform. In doing so, the president use his power consistent with his authority and in line with many of his predecessors, both Republican and Democrat.\nSpeaker 1: I was pleased that the president was indeed taking executive action to shield as many as 5 million people from deportation. Mothers and fathers and dreamers among them. I applauded the president, acting so that thousands of families in my district will not have to live with the fear of being separated.\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately, on February 16, 2015, a federal judge in Texas issued an opinion opinion ordering a temporary halt to two of the Department of Homeland Security's immigration directives, DAPA and Dacca. The decision was appealed by the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSpeaker 1: The appeal was later denied by the Federal Court of Appeals, dealing a blow to millions of immigrant families across the country that would have benefited from both directives. The White House White House has not yet announced what its next moves on the lawsuit will be.\nSpeaker 1: It is ultimately Congress responsibility to enact comprehensive reform, and rest assured that I will continue to urge my colleagues to take up bipartisan legislation to that effect. This is about parents, about families, and about children. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: When I started this afternoon.\nSpeaker 1: My joker armed robbery. Garcia will represent them. Then Garcia and their representative.\nSpeaker 8: Claudia Rivera.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Claudia Rivera. Just so you know, the day I go, I am a leader of. I think I have lived for 15 years in this country.\nSpeaker 8: It doesn't matter.\nSpeaker 1: These are my three children.\nSpeaker 8: But I mean, sitting with you.\nSpeaker 1: It would be very painful to me. For me separated from them. I go to the deportation.\nSpeaker 8: Is mowing the lawn as a pandemic induced ban.\nSpeaker 1: It is very painful for me. For them to see.\nSpeaker 8: You get your company.\nSpeaker 1: Especially my daughter, who now understands. In an anti-immigrant stance, what anti immigration groups are saying?\nSpeaker 8: Better geography that gives this one by the opportunity that is.\nSpeaker 1: But I firmly believe that this is the country. Either end of Dreamers.\nSpeaker 8: He told us. When was I keep saying, you.\nSpeaker 1: Know, we all come here because of a dream. In me is.\nSpeaker 8: The symbolism in my whole professional Mindi.\nSpeaker 1: My dream is to develop myself professionally.\nSpeaker 8: Yes. That that music autonomy.\nSpeaker 1: So that by this I can provide a better quality of life for my children.\nSpeaker 8: In that case, your senators were not you that I know sinister.\nSpeaker 1: Also prepare them in order for them to be better citizens for this country.\nSpeaker 8: You mean Akin in.\nSpeaker 1: Their first generation in this country?\nSpeaker 8: What if I would? Both importers had a solution.\nSpeaker 1: For this resolution.\nSpeaker 8: Gays and lesbians. Up, down.\nSpeaker 1: Comunidad Latina Latin community organizer, said, I would like to thank the crisis consul Lina Gonzalez. Lina Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 8: For.\nSpeaker 1: All you supported our community. Thank you. Oh, hi. My name. Hello. City Council and Mayor Robert Garcia. My name is Rebecca Ayala. I want my family to be with us. Not just my family. I want to. I think that the politicians are out there and that's why I like to support families all over the country have been\nSpeaker 1: all over the country. I want my country to be happy with the way their lives are now. People here also may agree. I'd like to thank the council members and Mayor Robert Garcia and especially Lena Gonzalez for letting us be here.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. Good evening. My name is Swimming Chair and I'm an immigration attorney with the National Immigration Law Center. So I'm here to support this resolution for economic and public safety reasons. National and local studies have shown that the DOCA program has had a significant effect on young immigrants ability to increase their earnings and expenditures, which results in\nSpeaker 1: greater contributions to the tax base. One national study found that almost 60% of DOCA beneficiaries obtain a new job after receiving DOCA and about 45% increase their earnings. This provides direct evidence of the economic boost provided by DOCA.\nSpeaker 1: The effect of expanded DOCA and DAPA would be even greater. The estimates vary, but experts agree that even modestly successful enrollment in the DAPA and expanded DOCA programs would add more than 2 billion nationally in taxes over the next two years.\nSpeaker 1: This money could be spent to improve infrastructure, education or other important local projects. L.A. County is home to an estimated 500,000 residents eligible for DAPA and expanded programs. This is the largest population of eligible residents in any of the nation's counties.\nSpeaker 1: These programs will help to lift immigrant families out of poverty and also provide them with the relief of knowing that they no longer have to fear deportation. Furthermore, law enforcement leaders say that darkened DAPA would make our communities safer by taking immigration fears out of local interactions with police.\nSpeaker 1: The Major Cities Chief Police Association, which is a professional association of chiefs and sheriffs representing the largest cities in the U.S., the Police Executive Research Forum, and 27 law enforcement leaders in areas ranging from Iowa to Texas signed onto an amicus brief in support of these programs.\nSpeaker 1: In their brief, they state that deferred action promotes public safety by encouraging immigrants to come to court, to cooperate with law enforcement, and by providing a means to obtain secure and verifiable identification. So finally, I just want to say that we should reject the prejudice, intolerance and xenophobia that some speakers tonight are promoting.\nSpeaker 1: That would be moving us backwards at a time when we really need to heal from deep racial wounds. Instead, we should be moving forward towards policies of inclusion, justice and equity. Long Beach communities and economy shouldn't have to wait any longer.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So before before our next speaker just wanted to show so we have about probably another 40 to 45 minutes of public comment. And so I know I know I have one or two councilmembers that have to also have to be leaving.\nSpeaker 0: So I want to make sure that we try to get through. This is a very important issue. I know. So I'm going to cut off the speaker's list at the very end. Who's the last person in line there, Senora?\nSpeaker 0: So we're going to cut the speaker's list there. I'm closing the speaker's list. And I know that we have a lot of people that are that are obviously supporting the item. So if we can, as best as possible, expedite, you have your right to your 3 minutes.\nSpeaker 0: So I understand that. But please, I want to make sure that people are here for for the process. So please continue. And we have the speaker list is now closed. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Good afternoon. My name is Maria Barrientos. I have been living in Long Beach for 23 years and I wish. Thank. Good afternoon. My name is Maria. Laurie and I have lived in Long Beach for 23 years. And since I came to this country, I'll always pay my taxes.\nSpeaker 1: If you would support the immigration reform, it would be beneficial for me along with my daughter, since we've always dreamed of having our own beauty salon. And this would be a business that would also help the economy of Long Beach because we would support other people in growing, along with providing a source of work for others.\nSpeaker 1: And they would also. If it's possible, I would like you all to support the immigration reform. Thank you very much for listening to me.\nSpeaker 0: Gracias. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 8: Well.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening.\nSpeaker 8: And.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much for your attention. My name is Ramon Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 8: And.\nSpeaker 1: I've been here for 20 years.\nSpeaker 8: E e resident.\nSpeaker 1: I reside in District nine.\nSpeaker 8: You're going to need that. And I'm.\nSpeaker 1: Looking for an opportunity in order to achieve a dream.\nSpeaker 8: Career.\nSpeaker 1: To study, to prepare for a career.\nSpeaker 8: In this space.\nSpeaker 1: Why in this country.\nSpeaker 8: Is it based? Because fundamental.\nSpeaker 1: Because this country has. Foundation for freedom.\nSpeaker 8: In principles and.\nSpeaker 1: Principles in education, which along.\nSpeaker 13: The way.\nSpeaker 8: Has.\nSpeaker 1: Taken this country to a.\nSpeaker 13: Development of.\nSpeaker 1: Technology, of technology and and science.\nSpeaker 8: Patel.\nSpeaker 1: Because of this.\nSpeaker 8: Your offer for.\nSpeaker 1: This, I would offer my talents, my abilities.\nSpeaker 8: In this space in.\nSpeaker 1: Order to cooperate with this country.\nSpeaker 8: In this special community.\nSpeaker 1: Especially with this city developing new technology. Eat and.\nSpeaker 8: Participate or just is.\nSpeaker 1: Participating in groups.\nSpeaker 8: Your organization or.\nSpeaker 1: Community organizations.\nSpeaker 8: Benefit for.\nSpeaker 1: The benefit of all?\nSpeaker 8: And conclusion.\nSpeaker 1: In conclusion, I would I would ask for your support.\nSpeaker 8: But not for.\nSpeaker 1: A comprehensive immigration.\nSpeaker 8: Reform awareness and support that.\nSpeaker 1: Could give us that opportunity for me as well as for others who need it. And in this way, we can show.\nSpeaker 8: A great potential to.\nSpeaker 1: Great potential that we can give to this country. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. That's just like to say that there will be no immigration reform coming up. Also, our system is not broke and our immigration laws are just simply not enforced. Secondly, America started as British colonies. We allowed immigration. But that's not what made America great.\nSpeaker 11: What made America great was our Constitution or rule of law. Every illegal alien that comes here is in violation of America's sovereignty and our rule of law. They have brought their criminality across the border. The reason they come here is because their nations are full of crime, because they have no rule of law.\nSpeaker 11: They brought that rule. They did not leave their corruption at the border. They brought their corruption along across that border. I as a legal resident, I as a citizen, a descendant of immigrants, I have the constitutional and civil right to live in a sovereign nation with secure borders.\nSpeaker 11: Every illegal alien that came has violated my civil rights, and they are the enemy of America. And they do not love America. They're just here for the money. It's just greed. If the money wasn't here, they wouldn't be here.\nSpeaker 11: This is the list of crimes that they want illegal alien criminals not to be deported, but brought back into America. In 1970, we were the eighth largest economy in the world. Half the population, a huge portion of our population.\nSpeaker 11: Stay at home, mom. We didn't have the crime that we have. We didn't have the water shortage that we had. We didn't have the deficit we had. It was a better California than all these illegal aliens have at it.\nSpeaker 11: Nothing. All they've done is turn our freeways into parking lots. The all they done is put gang bangers on the streets. We had safe streets until they came. This is the crime and the corruption they brought across the border and laid it here.\nSpeaker 11: Why in the world would you want to take felons? Car theft. All. Every. Every minor money laundering. And put these criminals back on the street. It is absolutely insane. This is not a nation of immigrants. This is a nation of legal residents.\nSpeaker 11: This is people who love the Constitution. I don't know what you hope to gain here other than put yourselves on our political radar screen. This, this. I'm telling you, this will be the confrontation point of all immigration in the future.\nSpeaker 11: This mean if you want this stuff downtown, when people come here on their holidays, go ahead and pass this ball thing and we'll have it. But I don't think people want to come to downtown Long Beach as the legal immigration rallies.\nSpeaker 11: Endlessly and endlessly. And that's what's going to happen. What that what? I have no idea what you're doing. You have brought crime and corruption right in here, and now it's seeping into you. Illegal aliens, they only bring crime.\nSpeaker 11: They add nothing to this society. And if illegal aliens don't have to obey the laws, why should anybody? And we see that. And why do their children grow up to be gangbangers? We didn't have graffiti. We did not have gang banging in 1970.\nSpeaker 11: We were a society of legal residents and we respected the rule of law. You are going to destroy this society. This will not last.\nSpeaker 0: The times have sought to strike you. And we don't need to yell when we're actually making public comment one. And just to correct one fact. California now is actually the seventh largest economy in the world. So it has actually moved up a point.\nSpeaker 0: So go ahead.\nSpeaker 11: My name is Elliot. Information on file. I'll be brief. I just want to tell a quick story about a friend of mine who is is an immigrant. When he first came into the country, his status was, I think, in question.\nSpeaker 11: But eventually he he was a legal immigrant. And I someone who really inspires me because I know we're talking a lot about the effect on the system and the government. And, you know what? Immigrants contribute or don't contribute.\nSpeaker 11: And my friend, actually. Got his doctorate, went to college because of the immigration reform, because people gave him the opportunity. And he's actually now the current mayor of the city of Long Beach. And this December, he actually sent out an email to a lot of people who are supportive of him and followers of him.\nSpeaker 11: He's quite a patriot, something that we kind of have some disagreement on. I personally.\nSpeaker 3: Am a little bitter at.\nSpeaker 11: Some of the issues that has happened in this country. But he's somebody who loves this country.\nSpeaker 3: He loves this country so much.\nSpeaker 11: That he said this Christmas, he sent everybody all and everybody who's been following him an email saying that this Christmas, he's going to ensure working with our president, that all of our veterans that are homeless on our streets in Long Beach will have a place to stay.\nSpeaker 11: So when we talk about immigrants and their contributions, I want us to recognize that they're not that far from us, that they're an important part of our economy, that they're important part of our community. I also want to talk about a lot of the flag waving that's going on.\nSpeaker 11: There's currently a debate nationally about a flag that stood as a symbol of racism, that stood as a symbol of the ugliness. Again, I have my disagreement with the mayor over over the patriotism, because I'm a little bitter at the ugliness that we've seen in this country, because they're this country is based on a long history of\nSpeaker 11: telling people, no, you don't have the right to have the same resources I have. You don't have the right to be recognized as a valid human being. You don't have the right to do anything besides work and not have the opportunity to education, not have the opportunity to have a diverse city council member.\nSpeaker 11: You don't have the right to create your own policy. And and I want I know that some councilmembers might have constituents who might be on the fence about this issue. And I just want us all to recognize that many of you have come from a place of struggle.\nSpeaker 11: Many of you have glass ceilings that you are some of the first in your generation to to represent people, to be elected officials. You weren't the right gender or the right color or the right whatever. And and I'm so glad that that we're moving forward on this.\nSpeaker 11: And I want to thank everybody who's been in support of this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you all. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name is Richard. As far as my information is on file, the American labor movement has always supported human rights. I speak for the AMA, International Executive Council and our members in support of Councilwoman Juliana Gonzalez's comprehensive immigration reform.\nSpeaker 3: Since October, some 57,000 unaccompanied minors, the vast majority from Central America, have crossed the illegal into the United States. Many conservatives are blaming the crisis on President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, also known as DOCA, which allows people brought here illegally as children.\nSpeaker 3: Work, authorization or relief from their deportation. Conservatives say policy that the policy which newly arrived of newly arrived undocumented undocumented immigrants don't qualify for has acted as a magnet, pulling young migrants from violence plagued, poverty stricken countries like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.\nSpeaker 3: But there's virtually no evidence to support this increasingly popular conservative talking point. Unidos Respeto mucho Podemos. Your God, I own a well, that Umana. Si, se puede. Si, Podemos grass. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 16: Good evening, Honorable Major and Council. My name is Jonathan Solorzano. I am a community organizer with the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition, as well as a lifelong resident of the city of Long Beach and a current resident of the ninth District.\nSpeaker 16: So I'm here today to show support for the DOC programs and also the need for comprehensive immigration reform. As you've already heard from our community residents, this is something the city really needs to get behind, because the truth is, our communities are disillusioned.\nSpeaker 16: They are disillusioned because undocumented immigrants deal with a variety of problems from housing, work prospects, wage theft, family separation and discrimination. We know our nation's immigration system is broken. And while we know it's difficult for local government to influence federal legislation, you have the power tonight to vote and show the nation what a city who embraces its\nSpeaker 16: immigrants looks like. Our community needs you to take a stand. Just as the mayors of two of the largest immigrant communities in the nation, Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles and Mayor de Blasio of New York, as well as countless other other public figures have done so recently.\nSpeaker 16: And just to show you the support that is behind this resolution, I would actually like to ask those in the audience tonight to please stand. If you are in support of this. I would also like to take the fall to thank the following organizations for supporting this resolution, which are the Lumbee Human Rights Coalition, Greater Long Beach\nSpeaker 16: Interfaith Community Organization, Building Healthy Communities, Long Beach, CPC Lane. The Filipino Migrant Center, Central Maine. The Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in a Healthy Community Housing Long Beach Latinos in Action Clay then as well as 120 signatures collected from residents throughout this whole process.\nSpeaker 16: And we would also like to thank council members Lina Gonzalez, Suja Lowenthal, Roberta Ranga and Rex Richardson for sponsoring this resolution. And while we are thankful for those who are here, let's not forget the millions affected across the country and the thousands in our city and those deported in this current administration, including my own father.\nSpeaker 16: Thank you for your time, and we hope you'll vote in support of our community.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just learned something.\nSpeaker 13: New that Mayor Garcia was a recipient.\nSpeaker 1: Of the 1986 immigration amnesty. I remember the 1986 law, and I remember three things about it. We were promised it would be the last amnesty. We were told there would be 2 million recipients and it turned out to be almost 6 million.\nSpeaker 1: And we were told that the border would be secured. So there I'm sure people have heard the definition of insanity.\nSpeaker 13: Is doing.\nSpeaker 1: The same thing.\nSpeaker 13: Expecting a different.\nSpeaker 1: Result. Why would we do the same thing again? We'll get the same result. A lot of people say. That families are separated.\nSpeaker 2: Because of this.\nSpeaker 1: But in reality, any person who breaks the law. Is in jeopardy of having their families separated. Someone who goes to prison because they broke a law is going to separate their their family. The Social Security trustee. Report and this has been reported on by all the major news organizations, says that Social Security disability is going to run\nSpeaker 1: out in 2016. I'm not making that up. It's been reported. They're recommending a 21% cut in all beneficiary's benefits. Why would we want? To add more people. To be getting more of those benefits, are you? Going to go around and apologize to the people, the American citizens, when they have their benefits cut because you supported putting more\nSpeaker 1: people into the system. The Long Beach City Council should keep their focus on our veterans. Our foster children are unemployed. Our students are homeless and other citizens in need. And I saw a bunch of homeless right outside of this council chamber.\nSpeaker 1: You should not be voting to support something that the.\nSpeaker 13: Majority of Americans disagree with.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 13: It's been a long night. Thank you so much for allowing the public to speak tonight. I would just like to echo what Janet said. We have a problem in Long Beach in our communities with homelessness. It's burgeoning. In my opinion, that should be the focus of a city council.\nSpeaker 13: We have veterans that can't get proper health care. Veterans that are homeless. Living in poverty. These are our citizens. These are people that live on this soil. Americans. Unemployment's very high. It's a jungle out there for the American citizens.\nSpeaker 13: And in my opinion, that should be the focus of a city council, your own citizens that are suffering and it's getting worse. The homelessness on the the civic property, I mean, it's jaw dropping. It's getting worse. That should be the focus of a resolution, in my opinion.\nSpeaker 13: And I would just like to add, our nation has over 400,000 foster kids, U.S. kids. The stats show they live in poverty. They're emotionally abused. They should be the focus of our society, our own suffering population. So I would just like to also add, we are a great nation because we are a nation of laws.\nSpeaker 13: And in my opinion, as a city council, a body politic should make resolutions that, say, uphold respect and obey laws. The citizens of the world, this sends the wrong message to our to the world smugglers that that Long Beach well will welcome your activities.\nSpeaker 13: So in closing, please, I would consider a no vote and think of our own suffering citizens. Look on the lawn of the civic center and and and help our own Americans. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Well, you guys looked like you were a lot more interested in chicken coops and your ideas. But I like to say that I don't have any problem with with immigrants, legal people that come to this country legally. I had the problem with.\nSpeaker 3: Illegal immigrants, people that sneak across the border and they think that they can come here and violate federal law. And everybody's supposed to just turn their head and go.\nSpeaker 4: You guys are wonderful people, and I like all you.\nSpeaker 3: Illegals out there. Stand up if you're in this country illegally, stand up.\nSpeaker 4: There you go. There's open borders for you guys. I strongly oppose it. I hope you guys do the right thing. Thanks.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. My name is Raul Rodriguez Jr and I was here earlier and this is why.\nSpeaker 9: I brought my constitution.\nSpeaker 4: And I appeal to your conscience.\nSpeaker 9: This is why I would like to have your attention. Because by you passing this resolution, you are in violation of federal laws, because this is.\nSpeaker 3: Under Article one, Section eight.\nSpeaker 9: Of the federal government. You do not have the right to pass in resolutions that are going to protect illegal aliens who are here illegally. They are lawbreakers. They cross the border illegally. They broke a federal law by doing that.\nSpeaker 9: And when they commit a crime in the state of California, that's another violation. So I'm asking you to vote no. On this resolution because you don't have the right to vote on it to begin with. Now, Ricardo Lara is a disgrace to the American people and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 9: He promotes illegal immigration. You can smile all you want. Mr. Garcia. I know that you're here.\nSpeaker 0: It's Doctor Garcia.\nSpeaker 9: Doctor? Yes. Dr. Garcia. You can smile all you want. But you know what? I'm putting you on notice. If you vote yes on this, we will do our best to get you out of office. Because you don't deserve.\nSpeaker 3: To serve the illegal. You deserve to deserve the American people.\nSpeaker 9: That's who you should be serving. That's your number one responsibility. Everyone to use. That's your number one responsibility is to serve the American people and not lawbreakers like the illegals behind me who are probably still standing. Maybe not.\nSpeaker 9: Anyway, the point I'm making is you should vote no on this resolution. I oppose it 100%. Now, they keep saying that the borders. Our broken. Well, the only reason it's broken is because we have a president who doesn't he doesn't know how to be a president.\nSpeaker 9: He knows how to be an emperor. And that's what he's doing. He is neglecting the laws of this country.\nSpeaker 3: He is violating our Constitution.\nSpeaker 9: By what he's doing. The courts eventually are going to put him in this place. The Supreme Court is going to put him in his place and tell him, you can violate our Constitution because it's wrong. So I'm asking you, please vote no on this resolution because you are not holding upholding your law.\nSpeaker 9: Your oath of office. And that's all I have to say. Thank you and God bless the United States of America.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 11: Today. My name is Jonathan Escobedo.\nSpeaker 4: And I'm here to talk about.\nSpeaker 11: The same thing we're all talking about here, immigration. I would like to say that I have a lot of friends that are.\nSpeaker 12: Illegal as well and that I've.\nSpeaker 11: Seen so far. They actually put more work into school than all of these people that have that are illegal here. I have friends then in heart transplants, but they can't have them because they're illegal. I have too many friends.\nSpeaker 11: I see them suffer. It makes me suffer. I just want you guys to vote yes. Have family members suffering like they brought up that we take their jobs when we actually take jobs that they are not willing to take.\nSpeaker 11: As illegal immigrants start from the bottom. They go all the way to the top by themselves. These guys don't know what they're talking about. They're being lazy. Some people be lazy. They have all the advantage of being legal.\nSpeaker 11: When we immigrants do not know no advantage, we take advantage of them, leaving us open spots at work. So that's I have more to say, but I'll leave it as that.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. And our last speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Mayor Garcia and all council members. My name is Dora and I'm from Acle. At this time, I don't want to talking about all of our Constitution because all of you are still there, no more than me.\nSpeaker 1: I want to talking about Paul in Spanish first. I call these two areas LA Solution Killer. Lay them in cambiare. Get Reformative in DA Gil Congress. Honorable your local Obama. Good to know what they give you will not see on your attention.\nSpeaker 1: They look good about the interior. Get not them. Was there any other communes that want to sue that I do can't organize that would make you lazy on yelp political competition the ideal reception unit are would not coalition parent pianist cable dad.\nSpeaker 1: But I guess the point of contact. Let's see. We can have it for tomorrow. See to get is yet. But I if those anti-immigrant things cannot get in the porter.\nSpeaker 13: This will be much more eloquent in Spanish, but.\nSpeaker 1: I'll do my best. You are the.\nSpeaker 13: Solution. The law should be changed. There must.\nSpeaker 1: Be reform. Congress didn't support what Obama ordered.\nSpeaker 13: Don't complain. Take action. And you will call the attention of the interest groups.\nSpeaker 1: That today refuse to turn around to even look. Start with your own city and with your people.\nSpeaker 13: Begin to organize, use the legislation, and put pressure on the politician. Leave behind the deception. Get together with the coalition. But you have to vote so that you can count. There should be a civic network formed if you want to stop these anti-immigration.\nSpeaker 1: Laws that want to deport us.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. Now I'm going to go back to back to the council, Councilmember Andrews.\nSpeaker 1: Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, because you didn't make comments. Yeah, that's right. Yes. Councilwoman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 1: That's okay. I first want to thank everyone who spoke. I think everyone, for the most part was very eloquent. I think I also want to thank my council colleagues, Suranga Lowenthal and Richardson, for bringing this forward with me.\nSpeaker 1: I first have to spend like maybe 2 seconds to give this energy. It really doesn't deserve more energy than that. But I find that some of the comments, it literally makes my skin crawl to hear the the level of hatred, the level of racism in some in some cases that is being portrayed by some individuals.\nSpeaker 1: And I just it just really literally makes me very sick to my stomach. These are not aliens. What's alien to me is that we call people. Aliens were alien. What's alien to me is that we still refer to people as less.\nSpeaker 0: Than we cannot be, actually. The public comment is over. So, sir, no more public comment. Now it's time for the Council to make their comment, please.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And so, as I was saying, it really is alien to me that we're still referring to people that way. With that said, an aside, there are real people, real faces. We've seen every single one of them in line.\nSpeaker 1: Their students, their mothers, their fathers, their workers. They contribute to society. They pay taxes there. You know, my mother is an immigrant. There are so many different people that contribute to not only the city of Long Beach, but to the the nation as a whole.\nSpeaker 1: And I think it's important that we're supporting this. We are the international city. So if somebody isn't interested in supporting this or they they feel that it's not a good idea to be hateful towards this. And what I would say is, you know, Long Beach is, like I said, an international city.\nSpeaker 1: There are different languages spoke here. We have the largest population of Cambodians outside of the the country. We have almost 40%, over 40% Latino in this population. And what's important is that there are people that raise families here, like myself.\nSpeaker 1: We raise families. We have jobs, there are educated people. There are a lot of good things that are coming from our immigrant immigrant communities. Comprehensive immigration reform is is needed so that families can stay together. Immigrant families contribute to the U.S. economy in a variety of ways.\nSpeaker 1: So it's time for them to be a part of our greater American society and for us to support them here in the city of Long Beach. Well, this is a federal issue. It is also truly a neighborhood block by block issue that is about families.\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, individuals, employees, they contribute to our society. The Council has taken supportive stances on specific immigration reform issues in the past, like DOCA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. We've all supported also supported the DREAM Act in the past.\nSpeaker 1: In February, the Federal Legislative Committee made the Directive support comprehensive immigration reform. And today, I want to strengthen that by passing this resolution. I know we've all heard it before, but we really needed to take a stance as a city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: While we cannot make these federal policy decisions at the council level, we can work to support our immigrant communities who are vibrant and active part of our city in so many ways. As a resolution states, immigrant communities contribute so much to our local economy.\nSpeaker 1: They are our fathers, our mothers, our students. They pay taxes. They are here to stay. They're not going away. Their families, they raise our families. All of the positive things that we can we can mention in a dignified, well-planned path that includes taking the steps necessary to become a full fledged citizen is a must.\nSpeaker 1: Many others took these steps, and we must honor that process. I hope that my council colleagues can support me at this time and I thank them.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Andrews, want to put your second? Okay. I'm actually a councilmember, your rank who seconded the motion and then I'll go down the speakers less councilmember Orengo.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mayor. I want to start by saying a few words in my native language. Spanish. You know, that is as good as. Yes, but I better go down to Tampa, keep an eye on us. So it is that is important to yourself, I must say.\nSpeaker 9: It's important that they never unite reform of the immigration game. I tried hard, but I told those barrelhouse Americanos. That was what the Multi-Course commandos played on was one of the Mohicans. Goebel told us that those places Gibson was extremely lucky in Long Beach, Samuelsen When I see that bicultural, bilingual eat mostly lost me as moderators there\nSpeaker 9: . So what if you read it and there in Westeros that it was common was a mass. You're so equal with the immigrants. I am the son of immigrants and I had just as much right to be in this country as you do.\nSpeaker 9: And I'm insulted when people say. We have to look after our Americans. I am an American. I live here. And I'm going to die. I'm not going to die. So I'm going to support this issue because it's very important that we protect our rights, our rights to live in this country, our rights to work here, our rights\nSpeaker 9: to raise our families and educate our schools. And in case you haven't heard, because you live in a cave.\nSpeaker 0: All right, guys.\nSpeaker 3: Mark Mark Kirk.\nSpeaker 9: Mark Zuckerberg on June 5th, 17th contributed $5 million towards a scholarship for undocumented students to continue their college education. If you haven't heard. Presidential candidate Jeb Bush has stated flatly he supports immigration reform and he will do something about it when he gets elected.\nSpeaker 9: Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said the same thing. Presidential candidate Hillary Smith. Hillary Smith. You'll hear Hillary Clinton. Well, we'll do the same in terms of immigration reform. It's coming, folks. It's coming. So you might as well be prepared for it, because all these citizens that not citizenry here are going to become citizens.\nSpeaker 9: You know what they can do? They're going to vote.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next up next up is Councilor Richardson. And please for everyone in the audience, I know we've done public comment. I'm trying to keep our decorum and for everyone, please. So let's please be respectful of both. Those are speaking as we did during the public comment.\nSpeaker 0: So next, I have Councilmember Andrews. Do I actually have Andrew and then I'll go Richardson.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. You know, it's amazing to sit here and listen to the comments from the various people because the fact that being a minority myself as a black man and I'm hearing these comments about immigrants. You know, I don't think any of the individuals asked to come here.\nSpeaker 4: If they say America Home, the great land of the.\nSpeaker 3: Free, why wouldn't you want to be here?\nSpeaker 4: You know, I think of so many things when I talk about, you know, I work at a school, Coco Brazil. I've watched those students. Who work harder than anyone I've seen there to let you know that a lot of their parents are immigrants and a lot of those immigrants a lot of those individuals are immigrants.\nSpeaker 4: I don't do this because of a political platform. I do it because I know it's right. We all have a right to live in America. Everyone has a right to be in America. And you should not have to live under the embassy of, you know, being an illegal.\nSpeaker 4: You please. Illegal. What is that? You know, like I said, I'm a believer in reform and, you know, immigration in the past in the United States. But the Hispanics and the Cambodian community, I've seen many families in my district separate and destroyed by current deportation policies.\nSpeaker 4: And there's nothing that I can do to help them. The Families United is the strongest that I know of, and we must protect the rights of all families to stay together. A family stays together, prays together. That is the only way you can live in a country like this.\nSpeaker 4: You have to give them a right to be together. You don't separate anyone from their family. I would totally support this issue. And the thing he brought to the diocese. Thank you very much, Lena, for doing this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next up next up is council member Richardson Jones. And I know I know everyone is supportive or not supportive, but if we could just try to get through the comments and please no side comments, I'd really appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: I know it's difficult, but please. Councilor Richardson.\nSpeaker 12: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez, for bringing this resolution forward and to all the cosigners for for signing on to this item. So I know that so the city council is well documented on this. We've already sort of in our federal legislative agenda process, we've already demonstrated support and expressed that support to the federal\nSpeaker 12: government for comprehensive immigration reform. And in terms of the president's executive action, it's been said that we should focus on our residents or our jobs. But I understand where the president is coming from. I represent 56,000 people in the ninth District, and I represent all of them, whether they're documented or not.\nSpeaker 12: We all are one community. We're all when one portion of the community is hurting, the whole community hurts. We're all part of the same social fabric. And I get what the president is trying to do. You know, Congress has let this fester for far too long.\nSpeaker 12: And he took what action was in what was within his power to prioritize certain actions, to place a priority on families and communities. And that's smart. It's economically smart here in Long Beach, here in California. If we just move forward with with adopting DOCA, we would see almost $1,000,000,000 annually in in revenue to our own budget.\nSpeaker 12: Is that something that we should not support as a local person who analyzes and manages the budget every year? It makes economic sense in terms of sort of the the culture in this country right now. I'm just sort of taken aback at at the comments because, you know, just less than two weeks ago, we had folks sounding\nSpeaker 12: very using very similar erratic rhetoric that we've heard tonight go into a church and do something very violent and very, very based on hate, based on hate and ignorance. And very easily, you can take out the word you can use those statements tonight and swap out the word illegal for the N-word very easily.\nSpeaker 12: And this will sound very similar to that. And it's and it's just not okay here in here and here in Long Beach. So what I would say is I'm I'm an unequivocally unequivocal support to this. I think that Long Beach is is we have a responsibility just like so many states.\nSpeaker 12: Spoke up opposed to executive action. We have a responsibility to speak up in support of executive action. A part of the democratic process. When we go to DC, we tell them what our priorities are. As chair of Fed Ledge, we're going to express our priorities and express our support for this.\nSpeaker 12: So that's it. Thank you again for bringing this forward. And I'm going to vote yes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. Next up is Vice Mayor Lowenthal.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I concur with my colleagues. I'm very thankful for the passion of Councilmember Gonzalez, as well as your anger and others who've spoken tonight. And I want to thank all of you that have come forward, actually, those who are in favor and those who are not in favor.\nSpeaker 6: I actually thank you as well. It's a constant reminder that we have so much farther to go. You know, this morning, many of us read in the paper that Governor Nikki Haley requested that the Confederate flag be removed from the state capital.\nSpeaker 6: And I was reminded that it's never too late to do the right thing. In 150 years, we may have only moved incrementally. But we've moved in leaps and bounds in so many different ways. And I'm reminded even tonight from the Rich conversation that we've had sometimes boisterous, a lot of times very disrespectful, which is unfortunate that life\nSpeaker 6: is rich and it's textured and it's complex. Just as complex, rich and textured as the people living them. But we have a shared tapestry in our history. Whether you believe that we are a nation of immigrants or you don't.\nSpeaker 6: The truth remains that we actually are rewriting that history. Is one way of living the rest of your life. But I'm comforted knowing that a great majority of us don't choose to rewrite that history. We understand our shared tapestry, and we understand that it's unfinished.\nSpeaker 6: When you see people that whether they toil in their own countries or they toil in this country, certainly when I see them, I am reminded of my own parents who immigrated here. And whether they did legally or not is of no consequence.\nSpeaker 6: But I'm reminded of why people leave their. Nation of origin and why they leave their nation of birth. It's a very simple thing to understand, and it's because we want to protect our children and we want to give our children.\nSpeaker 6: What we can and possibly what we're able to give. And that's not different from when our nation was founded. People left Europe to give the same thing to their children. And so. I'm thankful for the discourse and the acrimony that I heard today because I'm always reminded that our job is never done.\nSpeaker 6: This morning's single act of removing a relic from a time in our history that shouldn't either be celebrated or forgotten for the worst of its four bearings reminds us, just as this conversation does tonight, that our tapestry is unfinished, whether we move by two degrees or 180 degrees.\nSpeaker 6: The fact that we have moved in the right direction is our common cause and our common celebration. And I want to thank Councilmember Lina Gonzalez and the co-sponsors, as well as my entire council for raising awareness and support for the plight of our immigrant families.\nSpeaker 6: You make up our tapestry. I'm proud to be a part, a very small part of that tapestry. I will never forget that. Many of us at this diocese actually are our children, sons and daughters of immigrants. No matter how many generations removed.\nSpeaker 6: And sometimes it's that single act of bravery. And it's not ordinary courage. It's tremendous courage when people leave their countries of origin to come here for their children. But a single act like that changes the trajectory of an entire family.\nSpeaker 6: And I remind my son of that, that a decision my mother made when she was 16 changed the trajectory of my life and has. And so that's something to be celebrated, not not reviled in the way that we hear today.\nSpeaker 6: And, again, the discourse that we heard in the language that we heard is unfortunate. But I'm thankful for it because it reminds me never to get comfortable and never to look away from the ugliness that exists. Because the moment we look away is the moment we think our work is done and our work is not done.\nSpeaker 6: So thank you, counsel, colleagues. And like Councilmember Richardson said, the political jockeying between parties and between presidential hopefuls has undermined serious conversations on comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level and perhaps even stoked the fire of resentment. Some of that which we heard tonight in our communities rather than an honest conversation about those issues.\nSpeaker 6: I don't think it's a surprise for you to hear. I support our urging of comprehensive reform that reflects our nation's values, not just the values of a few, but our collective conscience. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I, too, want to thank my colleagues for bringing this item forward. I am the daughter of an immigrant, and I don't believe that this is a Latino issue or any specific race. We are a nation of immigrants, and immigrants in this country comprise some of the most hardworking and honest and dedicated people among our society\nSpeaker 5: . And I take a little bit of issue with any sort of allegation or assumption that there is a specific group of people that are committing the crimes in this nation. The reality is people are committing crimes every day.\nSpeaker 5: White people, black people, Latino people, people of all different colors. We've seen it in recent times. Some of the most horrendous crimes that we see are committed by our very own members of our community. So, too, to try to blame crime on a particular race or status is just wrong and it's factually inaccurate.\nSpeaker 5: So I do I do take offense to that because I don't think it's fair to label an entire community of people. Some of the people we heard from tonight represent some of the most hardworking people that you'll ever see, people who have 2 to 3 jobs to provide for their children so that their children can grow up\nSpeaker 5: in a land of opportunity. Those those parents should be commended for giving their children an opportunity at a better life. I had that opportunity. Many of my colleagues have that opportunity. And the parents that are working hard and doing their best to survive in this community and make their way through the community should be commended.\nSpeaker 5: And I do. I appreciate that. Tuesday nights are an exercise in democracy, and I take no issue with the comments that that some have made. Are opposed to this item. That's okay. We have that every week. People feel very passionately about the items that are before us.\nSpeaker 5: That's okay. But at the end of the day, we live among among one another in a community. And we're all trying to do our best. And that is the bottom line. Every single person is just trying to do their best for their families and give their their children the best opportunities in life.\nSpeaker 5: And that is something to be respected and celebrated. I think that the reality of our country is that we do need comprehensive immigration reform. What the specifics of that reform look like and what the compromises and the provisions and the final agreements will be, is something that still has to be discussed at a national level.\nSpeaker 5: But the idea that we have to look at this as a nation and figure out where the uncertainties are and what needs to be refined is important. And so I support this item and I support the resolution being brought by Councilwoman Gonzalez and my colleagues to this body.\nSpeaker 5: And usually most of my council colleagues know that any time issues like this come up, my first reaction is always, what does this have to do with Long Beach and why are we getting involved? I generally like us to focus on things that impact our city alone and really have our focus be on that.\nSpeaker 5: But this issue does impact our city. It does and impacts a large number of residents in this city and a large number of children who go to school in our schools, in this city. And it's important that we're advocates for those children as well.\nSpeaker 5: And that's where my standpoint is when I'm coming from this is, you know, what about those children and their future and the fact that they're here and we as a nation have a duty to look out for them as well.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next up, we have Councilmember Ringo.\nSpeaker 9: First of all, I am. I. I'm not unapologetic for my outburst. It was because I did have prepared remarks. But I just get too caught up in the moment that I had to say what I had to say.\nSpeaker 9: And I meant it all. Every bit of it. But I do want to give some thank you's to Congresswoman Janice Hahn, assembly member Patrick O'Donnell, state senator representing the representatives here to express their support of this issue. I think they recognize that it's an important issue, that one that needs to be supported and we need to support\nSpeaker 9: our president and working towards and our Congress towards comprehensive immigration reform. And I also want to say that to my mom and dad, who were immigrants here, who after 50 years became citizens and had the opportunity to vote for a rang up for their first vote.\nSpeaker 9: And before my mother passed two years ago in 2012, she died in November right around Thanksgiving. But she was very proud that she voted for President Obama and that she voted for him twice. So. When we look at immigration reform and we look at the opportunity for a path to citizenship, I think that the conversation is going\nSpeaker 9: to take a shift because there's going to be a lot of people out there wanting to change that conversation that we presently have now and the vitriol that we hear tonight. I hopefully will go away. I hope we'll go away.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Next up, we have council member Austin.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you. And I do want to thank our Councilmember Gonzales for bringing this forward. I will be voting in support of this myself. We as a country, we've kind of kick the can down the road for far too long.\nSpeaker 11: The time for comprehensive immigration reform is now. The problem has been exacerbated because we have failed to address it as a country. Our president has tried to move, move, move forward and advance the issue. And it's become a obviously a very political football that has divided a lot of us.\nSpeaker 11: I appreciate the passionate responses and comments from my colleagues. I appreciate the passion from many of you who bravely came up here and testified today on this important issue. Long Beach is, as someone said, is the international city.\nSpeaker 11: It's a city of great diversity that we celebrate. And I don't think we would. I don't think we can honestly support breaking up families. People are. Here undocumented. Not because they chose to be here. A lot of them children are born here, too, to undocumented parents.\nSpeaker 11: They're in our schools. They are are part of our society. They are they're a shadow economy, oftentimes in our kitchens of our restaurants. We need to rectify that. And in doing so, we need to support a path to citizenship.\nSpeaker 11: And so thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez, and everyone else. And we I'm serving on this dais with children of immigrants and with immigrants themselves. That's the beauty of America. That's that's why we come to this country. That's why we're proud to be Americans.\nSpeaker 11: And so with that, I'm happy to support this and thank you for bringing it forward. I got sick to my stomach earlier as well, so I'm going to be excusing myself after this vote. But I wanted to stay around to make sure that I.\nSpeaker 11: I voted yes on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Just I'll make a couple of brief comments and then we'll go and go to the vote. I'm maybe I'm I'm not sure this is part of the motion or not, Councilwoman, but I think it's probably appropriate that this, as being passed by the council tonight, would become officially also part of the federal agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. And so I know is asking our government affairs director and some of the assumption is, Mr. City attorney, that this would then become part of that agenda, if that's part of the motion?\nSpeaker 9: That's correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. And then the second thing I'll say is I just want to echo something that was mentioned earlier, and I think it's really important. You know, one of the things that I love about this country and I think I think this is the greatest country on the planet.\nSpeaker 0: It's the greatest country on earth. And one of the things that I love about this country is that we live in a democracy where people are able to have different opinions. And we can respectfully disagree. We can respectfully agree, but we have different opinions.\nSpeaker 0: And what what we should love about this great place that we live in is that whether we agree or disagree, we can do it in a way that's respectful and we can do it in a way that really lives up to the ideals of what this country was founded on.\nSpeaker 0: I there was a comment earlier about the Council focusing on on issues, on a variety of issues. And I just want to address those. I think they're important veterans. Veteran veterans were brought up in homelessness and unemployment, all incredibly important issues that the city works on continuously.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm proud of the fact that homeless homelessness is down in Long Beach by 18%. I'm proud of the fact that unemployment is at its lowest it's been in 15 years, that we have a great foster program in large part a lot of interest brought on to it because of Council Brough, Austin and others that and within\nSpeaker 0: the system that we have here. I'm proud that we have a goal to house every veteran in Long Beach that is experiencing homelessness by the end of this year. So these are all really, really great goals. I think these are goals are probably a lot of everyone in this audience can agree that it's the right thing to\nSpeaker 0: do. But I also think that supporting our our immigrants for supporting the men and women, but especially the children that are undocumented in our country in ways that I think we're very reasonable there. These are ways that these are regulations that I think our president has proposed that are reasonable, they're humane, they're thoughtful.\nSpeaker 0: They're not radical in any sort of way. I think they're very American regulations are very American policies. And so I want to thank everyone for for the conversation tonight. It's certainly been very, very vivid and very lively. But I want to thank Councilwoman Gonzales for for bringing this forward tonight.\nSpeaker 0: And so with that, we'll call the vote.\nSpeaker 1: Motion passes nine zero.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Now we'll go on to the next item. So we're going to go back. Okay. So 1112, we're going to go on to item 13, I believe.\nSpeaker 1: Item 23.\nSpeaker 0: Item 23, if we can get the clerk to read in 23. Thank you.\n",
        "summary": "Recommendation to request City Attorney to draft a resolution with the language below in support of comprehensive immigration reform: \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the current immigration system in the United States is broken and not meeting the needs of a 21st century economy. The current system breaks apart families, is not conducive to family reunification and ignores the economic contribution of the immigrant worker; and \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, since 2008 more than 2 million immigrants have been deported and one in ten children face the deportation of a parent; and \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, it is not practical or humane to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living within our borders; and \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, California has the largest population of immigrants, both documented and undocumented where one in ten workers is an undocumented immigrant, and immigrants are a vibrant, productive, and vital part of the state's growing economy, holding jobs in key industries such as agriculture, science, technology, service, health care and manufacturing; and \r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the City of Long Beach recognizes that immigra",

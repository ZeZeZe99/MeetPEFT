        "source": "Speaker 0: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next item is 18, please.\nSpeaker 0: 18 is communications from City Attorney Recommendation to Adobe resolution expressing intent to prioritize spending of t u t revenue for specific purposes relating to the ballot measure placed on the March 30, 2020 ballot city.\nSpeaker 1: Great. Thank you. This you know, I'll just I'll just add before the city attorney weighs in this is the resolution that follows Missouri that's essentially very similar resolution to the one that we did the last time, except we added community hospital.\nSpeaker 1: And so it meets the commitments that we have laid out to the community. And you have it in front of you. There's one member of the public signed up to speak, and that is Christine Pettit.\nSpeaker 4: My name is Christine Pettit. I'm the executive director for Long Beach Forward. And I sent you all a letter on behalf of the budget advocacy work group today, just really articulating that we'd like to see commitments to prevention equity included in this resolution.\nSpeaker 4: I also thought it was important to speak because as the support organization for Building Healthy Communities Long Beach, we pulled together community partners who are working on youth development and violence prevention. In 2016, when the mayor was talking to community members about Measure eight at the time, and in that meeting, our partners really emphasized the importance of\nSpeaker 4: an emphasis on equitable infrastructure and also a broad definition of public safety that focuses on prevention and is much more comprehensive than is outlined in the current resolution. It's really important that we recognize how land use, including infrastructure investments, are linked to the safety of a community and that we continue to invest in infrastructure.\nSpeaker 4: The historic disinvestment in central, west and north Long Beach, as well as other discriminatory policies have created areas of concentrated disadvantage. Sorry, I'm tired. Where residents have not benefited from the same public or private investments, infrastructure, maintenance and other quality of life improvements as people living in other parts of the city.\nSpeaker 4: These are the same neighborhoods where people experience fewer opportunities. Have your police seen a lower life expectancy overall? So we encourage you to add language into the resolution that prioritizes and includes a commitment to equitable infrastructure investments, as well as a definition of public safety that emphasizes prevention strategies connected to youth development and other community and public\nSpeaker 4: health interventions. Right now, the resolution very narrowly defines what public safety is, and we think it's really important that it is broader. I know that this is a non-binding resolution, and we know that, but it's an important statement of priorities for a forever tax.\nSpeaker 4: So let's make our intentions for a healthy, safe and equitable community clear tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. That you remember the public purse. Marie Andrews, any comments? No, Councilman. Also, any comments? Councilman Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, I know it's late. I just. This item is important, and I couldn't have said it better. I think our community member, Christine Perrett, hit it on the head. And I think really as we have these conversations, as we spend our measuring resources for an a forever tax, that we're consistently coming back to the conversation around how\nSpeaker 4: we prioritize based on needs first and really making sure that when we talk about public health that it's broad and when we talk about public safety, that it's also broad. And so I, I know that this is a conversation that we can continue to come back to.\nSpeaker 4: I look forward to hearing what my other council colleagues have to say on the issue. I know that my my district supports this item, and I know that they also support prioritizing on needs first. So thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Governor Richardson.\nSpeaker 9: Thanks, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, Ms.. Pettifor, for raising these issues. And so here's what I would say. Last time we passed a resolution, we came back with a plan, and the resolution was the what are we investing in?\nSpeaker 9: And the plan was the how. And I would say the issues raised are appropriate. I think I hope that we can address it when we get to what the plan from Israel is. I think it's valid to say the nature of it is different this time.\nSpeaker 9: You know, we were talking a finite period of ten years. What can we really realistically accomplish within that period of time? I think now that we're continuing it, I think we can sort of think about things like, you know, how often does the non-binding resolution get updates every five years as parties to allow us to update and\nSpeaker 9: think about that? And and we can we can have that conversation. Also, you know, I think it's not a zero sum game and it's okay to talk about what the needs are. And they might be different in different areas of town, but I think they're all valid.\nSpeaker 9: So to be able to say, I think council is doing a good job in these last couple of weeks, talking about this conversation about the streets, the worst streets and, you know, prioritizing them. I think it's done a good job.\nSpeaker 9: And I think, you know, we've done a good job in a lot of ways, as many council members have done a good job talking about closing the open space space gap or the playground gap. And so when we get to that, how we implement this, I think I think we're going to have to have like a full\nSpeaker 9: conversation on what are four or five like performance metrics as we move forward that we know that we're going to be closing. Right as we what's our plan? Are we going to say over the next five years or the next ten years, we're going to try to close the gap in open space in our city.\nSpeaker 9: Are we going to try to address some of the worst streets in our city? Are we going to. So sort of what's our plan, our approach? And I think I think it is appropriate for the plan. So so my direction, you know, my my staff, I think we should when we get to the plans, we go out\nSpeaker 9: and talk about if that's a part of this. I think we should we should be intentional and be okay with saying yes. The needs are different areas of town, other areas of town. It's okay to say we can address both or all three or all four because we can think a little bit long, more long term with\nSpeaker 9: this measure. And so I think that's okay. I'm going to support the resolution that's in front of us tonight. And my hope is that we can talk about what prevention means and what what these different topics are as we get to the plan.\nSpeaker 9: Thanks a lot.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And there's a motion in second to approve the resolution. Please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 0: Wishing. Karis.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 3: Manager to negotiate and execute a Third Amendment to the agreement with the County of Alameda, extending the term of the community, paramedics and pilot program by ten months and adoption of related resolution.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. Chief Rodriguez, do you want to present?\nSpeaker 4: Sure. Mayor. Councilman, at this hour, did you have particular questions or.\nSpeaker 5: Is mainly a concern?\nSpeaker 0: Actually, I'm going to stop you just for the benefit of the public. Can you give us a brief overview of what item five is about?\nSpeaker 4: Sure. Item five is the third extension of our community paramedic pilot program that was approved by council some number of years ago. And what this does is extends the staffing for that program through this fiscal year and into February of next fiscal year, and also authorizes the city manager to enter into an agreement for 104,000 additional grant\nSpeaker 4: dollars towards the program for the county of Alameda as EMS agency.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. And with that, Mr. De said, do you have a question?\nSpeaker 7: Well, thank you.\nSpeaker 5: It's mainly a concern because what I recall when I was on my last go around on city council and I believe we dealt with this in the year 2014 and at that time it was mainly funded fully by the county and.\nSpeaker 5: While I wasn't completely convinced that this was at the core of what the fire service does, largely because the nature of the program and I understand, you know, staff has might have will have some differences from this characterization.\nSpeaker 5: But to me, the nature of the program seemed almost research in nature and that the point was to gather information in an effort to improve health systems delivery. And I'm just not sure that that's a core mission of of of this part of the fire fire department.\nSpeaker 5: So so that's why I was willing to go with it in 2014, because it was funded by the county. But now we're at a point where the council will have, as be requested, to provide some stopgap general fund dollars to the tune of roughly $280,000 or so.\nSpeaker 5: Somewhere south of that, actually. So that's why that that's my concern.\nSpeaker 4: Sure. If I may answer some of your concerns. Thank you. Sure. So, Barry and Counsel, it is correct that the first two years of the program were fully funded from a state grant that was passed on through the county of Alameda.\nSpeaker 4: And after that, the park became a partnership funding arrangement, kind of a triad of funding. One third was from the city's general fund. One third was from the county EMS agency, which has committed funding moving forward. And an additional third came through the county's hospital system, which included our Alameda Hospital.\nSpeaker 4: Tonight, we are asking for the same general fund commitment that we've expended for the last three years moving forward. So there's no change there. It's exact funding that we've been allocating for three years. The county has come back with an additional third of 104,000, which we're asking for your approval to have the city manager negotiate that this\nSpeaker 4: evening. The additional third would have came from the Alameda Hospital system. Unfortunately, during all this time, the leadership of the Alameda Hospital locally has changed dramatically, where almost every key person there is brand new. So we're back into an educational mode with that new staff.\nSpeaker 4: But I'm confident we'll be coming back to you shortly with an agreement from the hospital system, because ultimately the county, as you know, has one large fund just divvied up among many departments. So it's just getting that education piece done.\nSpeaker 4: Secondly, this is really a core mission of what the fire department does. When you call 911, the term paramedic means hands of a physician. And it was really when the pandemic program started here in the 1970s, early seventies.\nSpeaker 4: And our interim city manager is one of the first paramedics in Orange County can attest to this, that it was really bringing physician care to someone's home, whether it was a cardiac defibrillator or bringing medications. And we do that every day for our community.\nSpeaker 4: This is taking a highly trained paramedic and putting him and going out to prevent people with chronic health problems from accessing the number one system and causing multiple animals, transports, etc., etc.. We're also focusing on our homeless population because they have no care system.\nSpeaker 4: But we're going to go out and start providing direct care to the homeless and make sure that we can get them to the services that they need. So those are directly at the core mission of what the fire department does.\nSpeaker 4: You are correct on the funding. When you were initially on council, it was 100% funded at the state. We're kind of special in Alameda because this is one of only 11 programs that have existed that were authorized statewide.\nSpeaker 4: And we're confident that we're going to come back to you in probably October with not a request for funding, but a request for us to contract with our hospitals such as Kaiser Alameda, because there's going to be health care funding available for community paramedics.\nSpeaker 4: And by having this pilot program in place, we're able to provide that level of service to our community that a whole host of communities would love to do, but weren't chosen to be part of the initial pilot program.\nSpeaker 4: So I wish it was funded already. Unfortunately, last year Governor Brown did not sign that legislation, but the same legislation is moving forward and we have all the confidence in the world and the assurance from newly elected Governor Newsom that he will sign such a bill as it moves forward.\nSpeaker 4: But again, that such time, you know, this is we'll be back to you with a lot of things on this. We'll be back to you with another contract. We'll be back with you with some permanent funding sources outside the general fund.\nSpeaker 4: But we're just asking for that continuance until next February, which we've been doing for the last three years.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And as long as Chief Rodriguez is up here, I will disclose that we actually talked on the phone a couple of times today because I had some questions about the reimbursement, not the nature of this problem project program.\nSpeaker 0: But I was on the council when it first came into being, and I'm also a former member of the alma mater, hospital board of directors. And so I understand that this is a great savings for the hospital because there are individuals who, for lack of other medical providers, use the E.R. as their primary care facility and and\nSpeaker 0: also lack the kind of follow up for chronic conditions that can get worse by being neglected. But for that reason, I feel strongly that the hospital we're saving, helping save them money and and physician in nursing time they should be contributing to this.\nSpeaker 0: But Chief Rodriguez is quite confident that there will be reimbursement from the hospital, as they've done in the past, and that money would go to backfill our general fund. Because my other concern. Heroin is is more of a process when we're going into our budget, into our two year budget process soon in the spring.\nSpeaker 0: And so I really like departments to bring all their asks to us at one time because we're just better able to to look and decide, you know, where what we can find and how much. But on the other hand, this is one that actually expired in November of 2018.\nSpeaker 0: And this program has been kept active just by the fire department finding some additional funds. I did ask that sometime in the not too distant future, we receive a summary, not just, you know, this is the sort of thing they do, but actual some stats.\nSpeaker 0: I mean, this is this program is collecting data for the county and for the state to see if these programs make sense statewide. So I would like to see and be able to share with the public what kinds of calls have you going on, how many and what period of time.\nSpeaker 0: And then the chief assured me that he's able to do to provide that his department. So any other questions or comments or do we have a motion? Just a.\nSpeaker 8: Quick comment.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 8: I want to thank the chief for this, bringing this forward in this program. You know, I remember when it was like two chiefs ago. I think we decided to be part of this. And I think we were the only ones doing one of the things, the things we're doing with this.\nSpeaker 8: And I think it's really benefited our community, especially our unsheltered residents, that this is their first point of contact. And I'm sad to see that, you know, we're cutting it from 3 to 2. But as you said, you know, the system as a whole benefits not just the hospital.\nSpeaker 8: I mean, the hospital benefits. And it was an ACA type of savings. And that was kind of the impetus around it. And I think we were all disappointed that the governor vetoed the bill last year because, you know, everyone in Sacramento worked really hard to get it through and get it passed.\nSpeaker 8: I was up there that day and it was like the highlight of my day. That day was when that bill passed. So I appreciate everything you're doing. And, you know, this is just a temporary stopgap until we have, you know, what I hope will be a statewide permanent program, because you guys are really doing a great job\nSpeaker 8: with everything you're doing. And I know that you update the liaison committee for the hospital every almost every meeting on the stats and the calls and the successes of this program. So kudos to you and your team that are working on this.\nSpeaker 8: I think it's an amazing service and I'm going to move approval of the.\nSpeaker 0: Item on a motion to have a second.\nSpeaker 7: Second.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So all in favor. This is an authorization to the interim city manager to negotiate and execute a Third Amendment to the agreement with the county of Alameda, extending the term of the community medicine premise and pilot program with the additional funding, as noted.\nSpeaker 0: All in favor.\nSpeaker 5: I opposed of the one opposed.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So the motion passes four in favor and one opposed.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor. Legal Counsel.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Rodriguez. All right. And now we're moving on to our regular agenda, and we have only one item, but it's a big one. So this is the the review of the 172 room hotel development located at 2900 Harbor Bay Parkway within the Harbor Bay Business Park.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Consider drafting staff to identify all accounts with Wells Fargo and investments in Wells Fargo Securities dropped a request for proposals for banking services for the city of Alameda and exclude Wells Fargo from the RFP process.\nSpeaker 0: And we have ten speakers on this one. There's this too that brought it. Did you want to speak to or other speakers?\nSpeaker 2: Want me to talk to Brody?\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Well, the vice mayor and I, after hearing from members of the community, brought this referral. And I will say that all of the hard work of drafting the language was the vice mayor. Thank you for doing the heavy lifting.\nSpeaker 6: But, you know, we have a situation where. The referral speaks for itself. So I'm not going to go through the, you know, read all of the details. But, you know, we have a situation where. We need to. The old saying is, let's think globally, act locally.\nSpeaker 6: And I when I was when the vice mayor was bringing this to me. I recalled back when I was in college back in the eighties and it was the mid eighties. And the cool thing to do back then was to protests or protests.\nSpeaker 6: South Africa and apartheid. And campaign for divestiture and. We didn't think that divesting the funds of Indiana University in South Africa was going to change. You know, international policy. But if we could do it and other universities can do it and other cities can do it and other states can do it, and pension funds can do it\nSpeaker 6: , then we could change behavior, and lo and behold, it worked. So that's kind of the theory behind this is that, you know, we have. A series of bad behaviors on the behalf of large banks, including Wells Fargo, including the fraudulent accounts.\nSpeaker 6: What I think is a bad behavior, investing in the Dakota pipeline. The foreclosure shenanigans that went on that really impacted our neighboring cities. So it could be that. All the banks are bad and we may not find one that meets our needs or could be.\nSpeaker 6: We have one right in our backyard that doesn't meet our needs. But, you know, we want to stand with the citizens of Davis and Seattle and and our voice to that that list and change corporate behavior. And just for full disclosure, I did meet with someone from Wells Fargo today and they announced that, you know, this morning\nSpeaker 6: three top executives were let go because of of things that, you know, violated our ethics and our values. So I think they're listening. But this referral, I think, will even hammer the point home even further.\nSpeaker 9: And I just want to add that, you know, before submitting the referral, we did consult with city staff and the city manager and also heard from our other elected financial officers through the city manager in terms of evaluating what sorts of investments we currently have with them, whether they be addressed, direct investments in Wells Fargo bonds or\nSpeaker 9: the use of operational products such as the banking services, which we do have. And, you know, and that's evident from our quarterly financial reports. But, you know, more importantly, speaks specifically to what the process would actually involve, which is why we we wanted to keep it open as a request for proposals to really meet the needs of\nSpeaker 9: the city. And the hope is, is that, you know, we do have a number of constituents who are adversely affected by the banking practices that came down, which is why we included a number of exhibits with the with the referral.\nSpeaker 9: And those exhibits include the many sanctions, some of the many sanctions against Wells Fargo for things like the fraudulent accounts. They were sanctioned also for student loan issues as well as for veterans mortgages. And I think is a for me, a formal Navy community.\nSpeaker 9: We have a lot of veterans here, some of whom I've met. Well, while I was going door to door this fall, who were adversely impacted by that, and I think, again, this is we're talking about taxpayer money. And, you know, if we're going to be using banking services or having direct investments in a in a banking institution\nSpeaker 9: , in a lot of ways, if there's bad behavior and we do nothing, then we're passively condoning it and we're not really speaking up on behalf of our constituents and those that are being impacted. And so for that reason, Councilmember Odie and I felt it was important to bring this forward.\nSpeaker 9: You know, their their investment in a number of different projects are not something that I personally support. And I know that many members of our community feel the same way, and it's our hope that we can find. And there are unlike some other cities, we do have local banking institutions here that can offer some of the needs\nSpeaker 9: that we have. And I think if we can do that without a financial detriment, which was my concern and my understanding is that there might be some operational issues involved in terms of switching over our accounts and that that would involve some staff time.\nSpeaker 9: But but really to look into this and to hear back from staff about what what would really be involved in it.\nSpeaker 0: I have a clarifying question. I asked that at this point through the chair because the first asked direct staff to identify all accounts with Wells Fargo and Investments. Okay. And then they would come back with that information. Then we would decide if we wanted to actually divest at that point.\nSpeaker 2: And we're.\nSpeaker 0: Just asking them to identify.\nSpeaker 9: Well, asking them to identify and actually walk us through. I did I did receive an email from our city manager that was actually from our city treasurer, who and I do think that it's important that the public know this.\nSpeaker 9: Our staff has been looking at this for some time and our City Treasurer has been looking at this for some time. So, you know, in terms of understanding our involvement with Wells Fargo and what our options are and again, not wanting to jump into this, but my hope would be that that they identify what's current because it\nSpeaker 9: could change quarter to quarter and then report back about what would be involved to give us the option to move forward with an RFP, if that's what we desire.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then the second part, the second ask is direct staff to draft a request for proposal for banking services for the city of Alameda. And then it has legs or parts of three or four parts under that.\nSpeaker 0: And then the third ask is to direct staff to exclude Wells Fargo from the ah from the earlier RFP process and then to refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo Securities for a period of three years. So my question goes to the second part of that, because actually the first part first part number three, I think\nSpeaker 0: goes with number two. And then the second part, I think goes with number one when they report back. And then at that point, we could make a decision as to. I think that would be when we make our decision.\nSpeaker 0: Are you asking us to make our decision now before you hear from them? It's the way it's written. It sounds like maybe you're asking us to make the decision now.\nSpeaker 9: Well, I think the the request is to not make any investments with Wells Fargo after we vote on it tonight and to refrain from doing that. And we can we can look we can get the information. But for the time being, my hope would be that we're not making any new investment.\nSpeaker 0: Between now and when staff comes back to us. And then when staff comes back to us, then we'll look at the whole picture and make our decisions about what to do moving forward.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I mean, that would be my, my suggestion to that. I know the Treasurer's done a lot of work on this already, but you know, he may come back with a report. You know, that that says it may not be feasible for, you know, account X, Y or Z, but on those that it might be feasible for\nSpeaker 6: . And, you know, we as a council would decide if we want to. And, you know, it could find out that, you know, the devil we know is is better than the devil we don't know. But I'd like to know that there would be, you know, other banks that are worse.\nSpeaker 6: I think we should we should be socially responsible with, you know, what I think as millions of dollars of of our citizens.\nSpeaker 0: So my question, though, is on number three, it says direct staff to exclude, which I appreciate that in the second part of this, we would be directing staff to refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo Securities for a period of three years or until they come back.\nSpeaker 0: And then we'll have that discussion. That's the way this is written.\nSpeaker 9: My hope is that we're not making any.\nSpeaker 0: Decisions tonight on that. Right.\nSpeaker 9: I my hope is that we're not making any investments with Wells Fargo starting tonight and that we can reevaluate.\nSpeaker 0: It in three years. Or is it when they come back once?\nSpeaker 10: That's how I'm interpreting it, is that this is a referral. The question is whether to bring all the data and information back to the council. And in the meantime, between now and when we bring that referral back for the larger discussion, we won't make any additional direct investments into Wells Fargo out.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, I think that's so.\nSpeaker 0: Then I would think that on number three that that part would be modified to reflect what she just said.\nSpeaker 7: And that that's fine. Whatever emotion comes up.\nSpeaker 2: That's what.\nSpeaker 10: You're asking. And then the other question, since we had this work goal setting workshop on Friday, is where in this priority do you want it to come back? And so just keep that in mind as we listen to public comment.\nSpeaker 3: Thank.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So, Gabby Dolphin Maxwell. Burn Shaft.\nSpeaker 2: Bruce Miler. And so it looks like the Treasurer would like to make some comments.\nSpeaker 0: The. Your turn is going to come at the end. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Well, it's late. And this is a big one for me. Standing Rock was never just about the North Dakota pipeline. And Wells Fargo is not just about the North Dakota pipeline either. What we what we see and what we as a minor example of what's happening nationally and internationally is we're watching these massive financial institutions.\nSpeaker 2: Before, we never really had to watch what they were doing. We kind of invested our money and thought, they're going to take care of it. They'll take care of it. Well, over time, what's happened is that we're discovering, we're finding out through the information that's coming our way in the past year in particular, that many of these\nSpeaker 2: investments are going to things that are totally socially irresponsible, like the Dakota Access pipeline. Now, why do I say that? Because this has to do with massive corporate interests who would sacrifice people and land call it the planet on the altar of very short term profit and gain.\nSpeaker 2: This is critical. Now, Wells Fargo is not the only bank, as you know. I think there are 38 banks that are funneling money into the Dakota Access pipeline right now. Some more, some less. But Bank of America, for example, is investing heavily in fossil fuel.\nSpeaker 2: And what they tried to do is try to paint themselves green by making plans for all the branches to be carbon neutral by 2020, which is a great idea. Nice solar panels on these panels of drive up teller windows.\nSpeaker 2: But this is basically meaningless when you stack it up against Bank of America's leading lending portfolio, which is chock full of loans to develop extreme fossil fuels, which are simply incompatible with climate. Stick with a climate stable world, and that's where we need to be headed.\nSpeaker 2: There is no question about that. If there is a fiduciary responsibility with these massive institutions that has now expanded to a responsibility to maintain the health of this planet the weather, the air, the water we drink. So if we define ourselves not by what we say, but what we do, let's take these historic, unprecedented times to define\nSpeaker 2: ourselves as a community by choosing to place our money in the hands of financial institutions and their there who have a portfolio already demonstrating a philosophy and an economy of caring through socially responsible actions. Thank you once again.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Maxwell and then Ruth.\nSpeaker 3: Evening. Mayor Spencer. Council. My name is Maxwell Bunch. I'm a resident and homeowner on this beautiful island. I applauded fully back Vice Mayor Veloso and council members on proposal to discontinue banking with Wells Fargo. Any banking institution that we as a community do business with should be absolutely moral, ethical and financially sound.\nSpeaker 3: That's basic criteria. Unfortunately, none of the major banks fit this criteria. Within the past few years. All major banks have exhibited criminal behavior similar and in some cases worse than Wells Fargo. For example, Barclays, ARBs, Citigroup, Chase and JPMorgan have pled guilty to felony price fixing chargers rigging the LIBOR.\nSpeaker 3: The LIBOR is the London Interbank Rate Exchange. Variable rate mortgages here and in the in in England are based on that and based on that rate. So essentially by rigging that, they're stealing from everyone. I have a May 2015 article from the New York Times dealing with this specific incident and criminal behavior and a press release from\nSpeaker 3: the Department of Justice. I'd like to give these to you when I'm done. I also have a printout from the SCC detailing recent criminal activity of major banking institutions. All the major banks are listed in this report, for one thing or another.\nSpeaker 3: From a fiscal perspective, all the major banks have massive derivative exposure well into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. The GDP of the United States I think, is around $60 trillion. This is worldwide money in this casino of derivatives.\nSpeaker 3: Exotic derivatives are what brought down the world economy in 2008. But Wall Street gambling is not stopped, and the Dodd-Frank hasn't done much to curtail this activity. And we're going to start to see a stripping of Dodd-Frank over the next few years.\nSpeaker 3: There was a bill in Congress in the House in 2015 to eliminate Dodd-Frank. So this this should worsen as things are deregulated. Derivative exposure is important. The 2005 Federal Bankruptcy Act gave derivatives super priority over depositor funds. So if and when a major bank files for bankruptcy, depositor funds will be taken to cover the banks derivative debts\nSpeaker 3: . It used to be that depositor debts were paid off first, and then any other debts of the banks were paid off in the in the event of a bankruptcy. Here's an article from Stanford Law, Law Review and Harvard Law School talking about derivative exposure.\nSpeaker 3: I also have a joint paper by the FDIC and the Bank of England. This paper details the FDIC position in the event of failure of a major bank. The plan is for a bail in, similar to what was done in Cyprus in 2013.\nSpeaker 3: Depositor funds were used to settle bank debts. That's this paper. It's geeky, but it's interesting reading. The major banks are simply too risky to have as a business partner. I urge the city to use. Can I have a couple more minutes?\nSpeaker 3: I urge the city to use. I urge the city not to use any of the large commercial banks and to use a local credit union. We have First United Services Credit Union here on the island founded in 1932.\nSpeaker 3: The union is large, stable and is run as a nonprofit. Nonprofit status removes the need for quarter after quarter growth at no cost, which is gambling with our money. The cost is as is investing in fossil fuels. A local credit union keeps deposit money local in the sense that loans are made locally.\nSpeaker 3: Using local dollars. Depositing Alameda money in a local credit union keeps our community wealth local and helps build our economy. If not for us, United Credit Services and another nonprofit credit union, I believe is the best choice for a banking business.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you and thanks for extra time this evening working.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for smiling.\nSpeaker 0: And could you send us.\nSpeaker 2: Like.\nSpeaker 0: Electronic links to all those articles? That possible?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Or.\nSpeaker 0: Maxwell, could you send us electronic links to all of those articles?\nSpeaker 1: I'll just scan.\nSpeaker 0: That. But yeah, that'd be wonderful. And separate from the scanning, you can do that, but I'd prefer the electronic links. It can do. Ruth. Smiler. Ruth. All right. Sorry to hear that. Benjamin Davis. And then Sherry. And then you'll.\nSpeaker 13: Good evening. My name is Ben Davis.\nSpeaker 14: I work for In the Public Interest. We are a nationally focused policy center. But I lived in Berkeley, so I wanted to come to show my support to divest from Wells Fargo.\nSpeaker 3: In addition to Wells Fargo.\nSpeaker 14: Creating fraudulent accounts and financing the Dakota Access pipeline. Another reason the city should divest from the bank is that it finances for profit prisons. So some quick background on for profit prisons. But the story. In Idaho, there was a prisoner named Honey, a lobbied, who was incarcerated for robbing a drug store for oxycodone.\nSpeaker 14: In prison, he ironically helped expose a drug ring between the correctional officers and the prisoners for his own safety. He was then put in solitary confinement. But as soon as he returned to his cell block, Haney was beaten nearly to death, suffering immediate brain damage.\nSpeaker 14: And two years later, he died. And Honey died because core civic. The company that controlled the Idaho Correctional Center valued profit above human life. And as revealed by court documents, core civics business model in Idaho was to save money by understaffing the prison and instead giving control of the facility to prisoner gangs, causing violence to skyrocket.\nSpeaker 14: And what happened to Hani is not a one off incident. Instead, it's woven into the fabric of how private prisons operate. Across the country, for profit prisons are plagued with violence. The the they neglect the medical needs of prisoners and their rife with other human rights abuses.\nSpeaker 14: And I think most alarmingly, because they profit off his incarceration, private prison companies make business decisions that lead to more people behind bars. So that brings us to today. And for much of the last year, I research the report titled The Banks that Finance Private Prison Companies that I emailed to all of you guys.\nSpeaker 14: It reviewed SEC filings from the past ten years from the two largest prison companies or Civic and GEO Group. And it found that private prison companies operate.\nSpeaker 3: As they do, largely because Wells Fargo.\nSpeaker 14: Finances their debts. As of last June, Wells Fargo was part of a syndicate of banks that had loaned C, C Corps Civic and Geo Group A combined $1.3 billion. Wells Fargo also underwrote $144 million of Angel Group's bonds and was the trustee for all four of Geo Group's bond offerings.\nSpeaker 14: By financing private prisons. Wells Fargo is not only promoting the abusive practices of private prisons, such as what happened in Ohio, but they're also promoting and profiting from mass incarceration. I believe that no corporation should profit from the incarceration of human beings.\nSpeaker 14: And Wells Fargo should cease its support of this abominable practice. And for this reason, my organization in the public interest is calling on all clients and shareholders of Wells Fargo to end their relationships with the bank. I look forward to what happens here.\nSpeaker 14: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Terry Jones housing.\nSpeaker 2: Mayor Council. I have a statement to give from the Alameda progressives. But I'd like to go off.\nSpeaker 0: This.\nSpeaker 2: Stage for a minute. And what Councilman Otis said about a part that I think really speaks to some of the issues, I think all of us of conscience feel very frustrated at the kinds of things that are happening to our planet and to our people and to our water and to a lot of things.\nSpeaker 2: And we feel powerless, much like we did with apartheid. And I think this kind of activity with basically taking our money and putting it into the the places where they do not condone this kind of behavior, I think is really important.\nSpeaker 2: So this is my state, the statement, the Alameda Progressive Command Council member Jim Cody and Vice Mayor Lily Avila available for proposing the divestment of city funds from Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is one of the 38 banks offering financial support to the Dakota Access Pipeline and its parent companies, according to research by Food and Water Watch.\nSpeaker 2: It is one. It's one of the 17 banks that have direct lead financed the pipeline construction by Dakota Access LLC, and one of only seven banks financed all of them with significant lines of credit offered to the parent companies.\nSpeaker 2: Energy Transfer Partners, Energy Transfer Equity and Sunoco Logistics. The animated Progressive's urged the council to approve this proposition and to investigate other measures which would ensure that the city of Alameda does business with socially responsible businesses. The City Council of Alameda can make a strong commitment to the environment and to economic and racial justice by moving its\nSpeaker 2: business to institutions with a reliable social justice record. Thank you. Thank you. As you all hail.\nSpeaker 0: And then Marcus Holder and then Silvia Gibson.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, everybody. Sorry to keep you all so late. So, my name is Earl Haley. I'm the political director of the African Black Coalition, where a statewide black youth organization who led the campaign to get the University of California to divest from private prisons last year.\nSpeaker 3: And from Wells Fargo this year. So our issue that we have is that when in 2015, when all of our our member campuses, eight of the University of California campuses, the black student unions, demanded that the University of California divest all of its nearly $30 million of investments in private prisons.\nSpeaker 3: Corecivic formerly Corrections Corporation of America and the GEO Group. We're all, for the reasons that Ben just mentioned, that I will not repeat all the violations, human rights violations that occur in these private prisons. But more fundamentally, we are opposed to the very business model of private prisons in order for a private prison to exist.\nSpeaker 3: There needs to be a constant supply of human beings being sent to it by the state. At a time when the crisis of mass incarceration is plaguing this country. We have over 2.3 million people in this country who are currently in prisons and jails throughout the country where the state of California is spending over $10 billion a\nSpeaker 3: year. And the incarceration regime, it just doesn't make sense to keep wasting all this money and wasting the potential of millions of human beings by caging them and condemning them to prisons and jails indefinitely. The other piece with that part of that campaign, when we launched it in 2015, was that we also demanded the University of California\nSpeaker 3: to terminate all of its relationships with Wells Fargo at that time, for a multitude of reasons. You know, they had refused to do that. And, you know, as time passed and the summer came and we came to find out about the 2 million fraudulent accounts that the bank engaged in, we reengaged with the chief financial officer of\nSpeaker 3: the university. I had multiple conversations with them that led the university to terminate for 175 million worth of contracts with Wells Fargo. So, you know, you've heard all the reasons that all the bad practices that Wells Fargo has been engaged in, it's very important that, you know, the values that we we we we we aspire to espouse\nSpeaker 3: . Right. The values that we say that we care about, that we live them out through our actions, that, you know, this is a bank. And in 20 and 28, when the financial meltdown happened was, you know, found to have targeted black and brown communities for predatory lending.\nSpeaker 3: And they got you know, they got sued for it and they got fined and they settled out of court in many cases, such as Baltimore. They're currently getting sued by the city of L.A. and Oakland for their predatory lending.\nSpeaker 3: And this is in 2008. And then we have all their investments in private prisons. We have their involvement in the Dakota Access pipeline, which is, you know, one of the defining civil rights moments of our history. So we're very grateful for the leadership of the vice mayor and Councilman Odie four for putting this on the agenda.\nSpeaker 3: And we urge you all to do the right thing and terminate all the relationships and invest in the credit unions and the local credit unions in order to, you know, make sure that our financial investments are aligned with the values we aspire to hold.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you all very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Marcus Holder and then Sylvia Gibson and then Jessica Reed.\nSpeaker 3: I'm Marcus Holder.\nSpeaker 7: I'm a 20 year resident of Alameda.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm also.\nSpeaker 7: Speaking here is a member of the ILWU International Longshore Warehouse Workers Union Local ten and a representative on of that union on the San Francisco Labor Council. And both my union has taken a position against the Dakota Access pipeline and the illegal use contribute contributed $17,000 in support of their legal fight against the Dakota Access pipeline of\nSpeaker 7: the Standing Rock tribe. And and in fact, like our our local president here and the Los Angeles Long Beach president went to the the water protector camps. And we with 20 other members, we built structures there. And this is my primary.\nSpeaker 3: Reason for support of this.\nSpeaker 7: Reconsideration is the Wells Fargo was involved in Dakota Access pipeline problems with the Dakota Access pipeline are that there was, there was a, um, there was no consultation with the with the tribes. It's, it's, it's, it's been built on burial grounds.\nSpeaker 7: It has the there's been no, not, not a decent environmental impact statement and the whole review process of the thing of the access pipeline it's basically been.\nSpeaker 3: Been built on a on one acre plots is how they've how they.\nSpeaker 7: Got their own um you know environmental impact etc. on the basis of one acre plot plots.\nSpeaker 3: And there's also the potential ruptures of the pipeline.\nSpeaker 7: Where, especially where it goes under the Missouri River, right above.\nSpeaker 3: The the sole.\nSpeaker 7: Water supply for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. And there's 15 million people that get water out of that on the Missouri downstream that and there's there's been worldwide opposition to through this pipeline. The camps there have had like upwards of over 15,000 people at them.\nSpeaker 7: They representing 250 tribes and nations representatives.\nSpeaker 3: Have been have been there.\nSpeaker 7: And. And the tribe and the camps have identified the disinvestment from the banks that are invested in the pipeline as one of the primary ways to now continue the opposition to this pipeline. So I urge you to disinvest, to do this to vote for this reconsideration and then go for on credit.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Sylvia Gibson.\nSpeaker 2: Jessica Reed. It's it's still evening. So good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. I did send all of you some comments as well. And I just support your efforts to make Alameda a responsive, responsible and humanitarian city.\nSpeaker 2: To that end, I appreciate your thoughtful consideration regarding the city's business partners. I hope you will vote to work towards ending any relationships the city of Alameda has with Wells Fargo for several reasons that have come to light as set forth in the referral form and in the Seattle ordinance that I did provide to you by link\nSpeaker 2: , including the unfair consumer practices and the bank's multimillion dollar commitment to the companies that are building the Dakota Access pipeline. Despite the opposition by those who hold drinking and fishing rights to the water that will not may will be polluted.\nSpeaker 2: And again, when not if there is a spill every time it happens and I hope you will work to adopt an ordinance like those adopted by Seattle Davis and the U.S. further, if we do not have one, which is my understanding.\nSpeaker 2: I also request that the Council consider adoption of social policies as part of the city's investment policies. We can send a message with where we put our money. Do we, as a city want to support businesses that disregard humanity and the environment in their quest for more money?\nSpeaker 2: Do we as a city want to support businesses that assist others in breaking promises and trusts of all for the sake of more money? Do we as a city want to support businesses that value the greed of a few over everything else?\nSpeaker 2: I believe the answer is a resounding no. I know we cannot stop such greed, but we can choose not to be a part of it. There are other banking options such as those mentioned previously, and also new resource bank and state beneficial bank.\nSpeaker 2: Our choice in business partners is a reflection of who we are as a city. Thank you very much for your.\nSpeaker 5: Consideration and your.\nSpeaker 2: Service. And I I'd like to close with a quote from Rachel Carson from the sense of wonder, those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.\nSpeaker 0: Laura kind's father. And then Becca Locke's. And our last. Austin. And then Sasha. And there are loudspeakers. And then the caverns. Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. Good evening. I'm a resident of Ballymena. My name is Laura Cairns Spotter. I am also the mother of a five year old and.\nSpeaker 4: I hold a Ph.D. in.\nSpeaker 9: Environmental.\nSpeaker 2: Science. I would like to express my strong support for this proposal. For divesting from the cities.\nSpeaker 9: Funds from Wells Fargo Bank.\nSpeaker 2: Wells Fargo Bank is one of.\nSpeaker 9: 33 banks that is funding the.\nSpeaker 2: Construction of the Dakota Access pipeline and the Bakken pipeline, which connects to the Dakota Access pipeline. So there are 17 banks that are directly involved in the Dakota Access pipeline, and then there are an additional number that add up to 33 that are involved in the connecting pipeline.\nSpeaker 2: Those pipelines would bring massive amounts of oil and gas.\nSpeaker 4: From Canada to the United.\nSpeaker 2: States. Meanwhile, 97% of climate change scientists agree that the climate is warming. And that this climate change is being caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Most or all of the 3% of scientists who don't agree that the climate is warming and that it's being caused by burning oil and gas are being paid by oil and gas companies\nSpeaker 2: . Global warming is the most crucial environmental issue of our time. We don't slow down how much fossil fuel we're burning and how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we're putting into the atmosphere. We will risk sea level rising.\nSpeaker 9: Increasing floods, hurricanes and other.\nSpeaker 2: Natural disasters across the globe, and the loss of plants and animals to extinction, among other things.\nSpeaker 9: Sometimes scientists have even said that our planet could become uninhabitable within our children's lifetimes.\nSpeaker 2: So it's of utmost importance that we act now and act quickly. The faster we can slow down our fossil fuel consumption and the more we can leave oil and gas in the ground rather than extracting it, the better.\nSpeaker 2: So I would urge you to divest from Wells Fargo Bank. According to Bill McKibben, founder of 350 dot Org.\nSpeaker 4: Which is a nonprofit leading the effort to reduce carbon emissions.\nSpeaker 2: Banks are more susceptible to pressure than the.\nSpeaker 4: Oil and gas giants, which depend on.\nSpeaker 2: Bank loans and lines of credit to build their pipelines. It's probably sustained public pressure that will do the most good, he recently wrote. Here are some other financial institutions that would be much better choices. New Resource Bank. The Resource Bank invests in environmental causes and is social and in social good projects.\nSpeaker 2: And it's located in San Francisco. Provident Credit Union.\nSpeaker 4: Which has a branch in Alameda and has.\nSpeaker 2: Excellent customer service and low fees.\nSpeaker 9: And I've been an account holder there for more than ten years, so I can.\nSpeaker 0: Attest it's a.\nSpeaker 2: Great institution and I also would recommend Patel KO.\nSpeaker 10: Credit Union for consideration.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for the opportunity to submit public comment on this important issue.\nSpeaker 0: If Becca, then Austin and then Sasha. And then let's measure an auditor.\nSpeaker 2: As the Treasurer. Hi. Sorry, I lost my voice a little bit. Singing karaoke, actually. My name is Becca Lux. I just moved to Oakland, although I was born there. And I work in Alameda now as a nanny for a three year old and a six year old.\nSpeaker 2: Awesome. Kids live in your guys's neighborhood. We talk a lot about water with the kids. And I've done a lot of work with kids where also we talk a lot about water. And when the sue when the Lakota people say many whites only water is life, that's not a slogan.\nSpeaker 2: It's not a hashtag. You know, that's actually an ancient tenet of native peoples all over the world that's understood by those peoples much more, I think, than our society, as the fact that we as a species cannot sustain life, we cannot sustain ourselves, we can't support each other.\nSpeaker 2: We can't continue to progress into the future. As a modern society, if we're poisoning our water, if we're being irresponsible with our water, and if we're not protecting our water resources for the future, water brings everything, you know, food.\nSpeaker 2: We drink it and then we need it to power our lives in every other way as well. And I think that what the Sioux themselves are asking for right now the most is actually divestment from these financial institutions.\nSpeaker 2: And like everyone here has been saying, we can't do that just on a national level. We're going to have to start locally. And these are the kinds of communities where we need to start. Alameda is a beautiful place where people truly do believe in the values of, for example, standing up for our water rights and for native\nSpeaker 2: peoples indigenous people's rights, you see. And so I actually grew up in Davis, so I appreciate the shout out. I've worked on the movement to support the Standing Rock Sioux in Davis and in Santa Cruz. And now I'm newly here to the Bay Area, and I want to help out here, too.\nSpeaker 2: I think that it's really, really important, especially for our smaller communities like Davis, like Alameda, where we're progressive and where we believe in these values to lead the way and show the rest of the nation that this is possible and that step by step, we can actually create a political system from the grassroots, from the ground up\nSpeaker 2: that works for the people in this town and in this nation. So I encourage you I thank you guys very much for starting this process and hopefully you'll be able to review divesting from Wells and then we can move on from there to other financial institutions and other steps.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Oscar. Austin looks like. Why a Nikki Wang?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Well, good morning, everyone. We've officially moved into the wee hours of the morning. I just would like to say thank you so much for listening to all of us and staying this long. It's been a marathon. This is my first city council meeting and I have lived in Alameda for three years and I really appreciate that my\nSpeaker 1: voice will be heard and being a part of this civic process. As you know, the Dakota Access Pipeline project is near completion and the Keystone XL Pipeline Project has been revived and will likely be completed with devastating environmental and human health impacts.\nSpeaker 1: Unfortunately, the Trump administration is not particularly receptive to direct nonviolent action opposing such reckless projects. No amount of calling, writing or protesting are likely to stop the Trump administration administration from pushing forward harmful, unnecessary and ill conceived projects such as these pipelines.\nSpeaker 1: Our last defense and a crucial bargaining chip is our money. As a city, we have the opportunity to be on the right side of history by moving our city's money out of DAPL funding banks. It is more important than ever for us as a city with a strong moral character, and I really believe that.\nSpeaker 1: Love Alameda to join other cities in diversity and from DAPL funding entities. I suggest the city of Alameda locate a credit union into which it move its funds as those entities serve stakeholders, not shareholders. And I'll just close with this.\nSpeaker 1: The citizens of Alameda stand with Standing Rock, and we are one earth. We are one people. And we need to stand together. So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Fashion has taught us.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 10: I wasn't going to say anything, but after 5 hours, I decided.\nSpeaker 1: Maybe I shouldn't.\nSpeaker 2: And I had my pajama shirt on. So it's putting my children to bed before I got here anyway. Hello.\nSpeaker 10: My name is Sasha Moustakas.\nSpeaker 1: I live two blocks away on Santa.\nSpeaker 5: Clara and this is also my first city.\nSpeaker 2: Council meeting here in Alameda. I've lived here for two years and I'll make this short.\nSpeaker 9: Why should the city of Alameda divest from Wells Fargo? Because Wells Fargo.\nSpeaker 2: Has done lots of horrible things to lots of not horrible people because it's the right thing to do.\nSpeaker 1: Because we don't want to be implicated with inhumane acts of the Dakota Access pipeline and.\nSpeaker 5: For profit.\nSpeaker 2: Prisons. Because our money does talk.\nSpeaker 1: Because it violates Almeida's investment policy.\nSpeaker 2: Because we must stand up, because we have to.\nSpeaker 9: Support the sacred lands of Native.\nSpeaker 5: People, because water is life, because we are a city with high values and.\nSpeaker 9: We need to put.\nSpeaker 2: Our money where our mouth are. Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: As a candidate, you want to come up? And he's our last speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Hmm.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening, Madam Mayor.\nSpeaker 7: City Council staff. I'm Kevin Kennedy, the city treasurer. As was mentioned, the finance director, Elaina Adair, who's here also. God bless you for staying here this late. And I have been talking about this issue for a couple of months.\nSpeaker 7: We've been doing some initial reconnaissance on where we stand as a city. Also talking to our money managers about this. We have a pretty good grasp on the situation as far as our exposure, if you want to call it that.\nSpeaker 7: Should you pass this resolution tonight or this referral? Clearly, I'm very happy to work with all of you to craft something that reflects these needs. When it comes to the operating accounts, it's really more of an internal matter.\nSpeaker 7: I think Olena, our finance director, will be working with you on that one question or point of clarification, I just wanted to get from the referral tonight, you had some discussion and I was a little confused. Our plan is to do the annual investment policy review in about six weeks in April.\nSpeaker 7: And I think in that timeframe we can certainly incorporate whatever we come to, whatever conclusions we might come to as far as how we want to reflect this formally on our investment policy. But it sounds like maybe we need to be notifying.\nSpeaker 3: Our money managers.\nSpeaker 7: Tomorrow morning about some decisions. I just want to be clear as to whether we're going to handle this through a revision of the investment policy, which I think is probably the more formal way to do this or that.\nSpeaker 7: We want to kind of have an interim ad-hoc thing. I want to make sure that that we that I and our finance director have clarity on that so that we can share that with our managers. So I would just look for your feedback on that issue and how we should move forward with it.\nSpeaker 0: I swear to God.\nSpeaker 2: Well, my question.\nSpeaker 9: Would be, what what does that entail in terms of you said you could call the ad.\nSpeaker 2: Hoc.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, I. Having operated in the financial world my whole career, I would say that we're best served as an organization, giving them formal direction, and I think that's through our investment policy. I do recognize that this is an issue that we're discussing and a lot of people have taken time out and state are very late to express\nSpeaker 7: their concerns about it tonight. I'm not sure if six weeks and drafting this and implementing it through our investment policy is acceptable. But I would say that if it is, that's the best way to do it, because what we need to do is, is to make sure that the people that are that are handling these investments for\nSpeaker 7: us are very clear as to what our intention is. And I think the best way to do that is through our investment policy. So my suggestion would be if it's acceptable that maybe the referral is that we talk through all of this, figure out how we want to reflect it, and we plan on approving a new investment\nSpeaker 7: policy in the month of April that will incorporate this. And we can give formal notice not only on additional purchases, but also how to address the three securities that we own today altogether so that they're very clear as to how they're supposed to be executing our instructions.\nSpeaker 9: I'm amenable to that. I think that as long as we're, you know, six weeks, if if we can actually use that time to craft something that's going to be quality and reflect what we're trying to achieve, I would rather do that than give some some.\nSpeaker 9: Misinformation or be unclear.\nSpeaker 0: About the matter.\nSpeaker 7: I think the Treasurer has put out a very good point. I certainly don't want to have the city own. If part owner of a company that defrauded people runs private prisons and. The more I find out, the worse it gets.\nSpeaker 7: So I think that I think that's the point. But the second point is. Where does the money go, if not there? And that's where a policy that is not directed at specifics of Wells Fargo. But what our standard is, is we can't move the money someplace else without understanding how we measure the new location or the new\nSpeaker 7: institution that's going to handle the money. So I think in the interim, we say no more investments in Wells Fargo and we await for that policy update so that we can. Make it. Take the the the money and place it someplace that's acceptable.\nSpeaker 7: Okay. So that it's very late. I could just be. I is way past my bedtime. It sounds the two different things. So the question is, between now and when we approve a policy that reflects whatever conclusions that we come to as far as how we want to address this issue.\nSpeaker 7: Should we instruct staff and the people handling the money on a daily basis that we want no more money going that direction? I think on the operational basis that would be very difficult, clearly. But investment wise, my again, my recommendation would be that we have a thoughtful, formal approach to how we want to deal with this.\nSpeaker 7: And my side is the investment said the operational said, I think, you know, staff and our finance director will know that. But but in terms of the investment side, that we address that comprehensively. And not temporarily, if that makes sense.\nSpeaker 7: If. Is that. Is that. I think I'm agreeing with you. Is that okay? We're not going to put any more money there.\nSpeaker 4: Meaning we're not going to buy any more Wells Fargo Securities. That's right. As opposed to putting any more money.\nSpeaker 7: So that's no, the difference between being an owner is one thing. Being a customer is another thing and how you how you we don't have anything to base on how we're how what it would mean to change as a customer.\nSpeaker 7: And I think we need that information to understand. How to have that, how to set those parameters. But it's to me, it's fairly simple. On the investment side is we're not going to buy any more securities. Until we have criteria, we can't move the securities that we have someplace else until we know how to measure the someplace\nSpeaker 7: else. Is that me? Is that clear? It is, but it sounds a little bit different than what the vice mayor was maybe saying. And again saying what I'm saying. Yeah. So so I guess in a yes or no way tomorrow morning, should we be calling the money managers saying don't buy any more Wells Fargo Securities?\nSpeaker 2: That's, I would say, more structured.\nSpeaker 7: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, I think that's okay.\nSpeaker 0: So that we would not be purchasing any new securities and that you come back with a plan in regards to divesting the current investments in the six weeks when you come back.\nSpeaker 2: I'm just curious if that's what I'm hearing. That wasn't really agenda, right?\nSpeaker 11: I mean, the way the referral.\nSpeaker 3: This is a.\nSpeaker 7: Detailed question to be handled on the quarter after 12, but it's relatively important because I don't want.\nSpeaker 4: To look at look at the wording of the referral.\nSpeaker 0: Well, this actually said that for a period of three years or a.\nSpeaker 9: Period of three years.\nSpeaker 4: Well, you know, it's.\nSpeaker 7: And that seems somewhat arbitrary.\nSpeaker 0: But it does. So we should be okay. But I'm going to ask.\nSpeaker 9: A strong staff to exclude Wells Fargo from the RFP process described and to refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo securities period of.\nSpeaker 0: Three years. And I think we could actually modify that until further counsel direction.\nSpeaker 2: Could.\nSpeaker 3: Hmm.\nSpeaker 0: Until further direction. So that's where I think.\nSpeaker 7: Does that.\nSpeaker 0: Well, because we do that. We take action sometimes on something like this. We just did earlier sending a letter. It didn't have to come back.\nSpeaker 7: To the attorney.\nSpeaker 2: I think you can. You can because it does say refrain for the next three years. I guess I don't mean to be argumentative and it is past midnight, but if I would just to help, I don't know. I'm helping her or making it worse.\nSpeaker 2: But if I understood the city treasurer, he was hoping to give direction to the investment folks with the investment policy and not make a phone call tomorrow morning. Is that correct?\nSpeaker 7: I just think I understand completely what we're aiming for. I think the the way to do it is through the investment policy, which addresses not only what we do going forward, but also what we have currently. And this is just the investments, not the operating stuff.\nSpeaker 2: Right.\nSpeaker 7: And I just I I'm not sure verbal instruction is going to be quite honestly, is going to be.\nSpeaker 3: Enough.\nSpeaker 7: To ensure that this is executed. I think we will need some sort of written instruction. So really what we're doing, I guess, in essence, is it quarter after 1224 told us we're modifying our investment policy formally through this referral if we if we do it effective.\nSpeaker 7: Right now, which, again, I don't have a problem with that. I'm not sure if that was the intention. I just wanted to be clear.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So personally, I would think that we could at least give the verbal direction and then we can hammer out. That doesn't if it isn't sufficient, then we'll get the update in six weeks and do more. But at this point, I've heard a majority and I'm going to say, which is what I came back to originally, that\nSpeaker 0: is not to to refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo securities until further counseled direction. So do we have a motion?\nSpeaker 6: I'll make that motion.\nSpeaker 0: So the motion is.\nSpeaker 6: Well to move the entire referral. But then with that amendment that you just mentioned.\nSpeaker 0: To counsel until further direction from counsel.\nSpeaker 4: We say it again so we know.\nSpeaker 0: So the referral is here. Consider directing staff to one identify all accounts with Wells Fargo and investments in Wells Fargo Securities to draft a request for proposal RFP for banking services for the city of Alameda. Three Exclude Wells Fargo from the RFP process and refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo securities until further counsel direction.\nSpeaker 0: Period. Right. That's your motion. I'm going to second of all those in favor.\nSpeaker 6: I, I.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 0: I passed this unanimously. Thank you. Council member Communications. And Brody.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Councilman CdeBaca has called out Bill 678 for comment and 818 for a vote under Bill's for final consideration. No items have been called out and under pending. No items have been called up today. Miss anything? All right, Madam Secretary, will you please for the first item on our screens?\nSpeaker 0: This is 825. Councilman Herndon, would you please put resolution 825 on the floor.\nSpeaker 1: And move the council resolution 19 to 0 8 to 5 be adopted?\nSpeaker 0: It has been moved and seconded. Comments by Members of Council Councilwoman CdeBaca.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. I called this out because this is a lease change for a downtown establishment called Onyx. Currently it was previously known as Ebony. Do are the owners or the parties of this lease in the audience?\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So I'm calling it out because the a little bit of background, there were some issues that arose in 2016 and 2017 regarding some something that happened on the patio of this establishment. This establishment was bought out or the lease was transferred in 2018.\nSpeaker 4: And then there was an incident in July of 2019 that raised some safety concerns. The new owners were not given substantial time to remedy the issues that were raised. The owners are people of color. This is an establishment owned by the city, leased out to the club.\nSpeaker 4: And so I just wanted to make it clear that I don't feel that the way we went about this process with these tenants was fair. I think that for a transfer of ownership that happened in 2018 where parties were engaging in good faith and paying extra money for security of a parking lot that they were not leasing\nSpeaker 4: . And then to have incidents that were never exclusively tied to the establishment is incredibly problematic. And so I recognize that both parties have signed this agreement, but I did want it to go on record that I do not support the way that these tenants were essentially strong armed into a lease amendment without a place for them to\nSpeaker 4: go. Otherwise, in a time when it's very difficult for tenants of businesses to find affordable rent in other areas near this establishment. And so I want the city to make sure that we prioritize getting a minority or woman owned business into this space when we open it up for future uses and not make the same mistake in\nSpeaker 4: the future. So thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Herndon.\nSpeaker 1: Is president. I saw Lisa Lumley come up, and I'm not sure if someone else this came to committee. We had a pretty thorough conversation in committee, so I didn't I wanted to give the city the opportunity if they wanted to do a quick summary about why we are here.\nSpeaker 1: If and if not, you know, I just want to for you all that opportunity.\nSpeaker 6: I think.\nSpeaker 9: There's actually. Is there somebody.\nSpeaker 6: Else from the city attorney's office.\nSpeaker 1: Or we to have gender if you want to come up. Thank you. Just wanted to allow the city to share what they had shared with the floor, with the Biz Committee about this and why we're here.\nSpeaker 5: Hi. Good evening. I'm Ginger White, executive director of Arts and Venues. And I appreciate the comment and the question. So this release was actually a lease that the city entered into. It's a long story around the master lease with Mickey Fouts and then it transferred in 2016.\nSpeaker 5: Actually, it's been the same same partners and business partners throughout. As far as we're concerned. The lease the lease in the ownership didn't change. That being said, we had four incidents involving firearms. The first one on June 30th.\nSpeaker 5: The second one on July 5th. Also on July 5th, there was an incident that someone was beaten to the point of unconsciousness. We also had another incident with a firearm on July 8th and then the fourth one on July 21st.\nSpeaker 5: So the amount of activity was what at with firearms on the in the neighborhood at this leased premises, an adjacent arts complex parking garage, large garage is what prompted us beginning July 10th to issue a notice of concern after that notice.\nSpeaker 5: Concern of concern is when we had that fourth incident and that by that point, as a city agency, we believe that we have a higher standard for public safety and what it means to be a good neighbor and felt we needed to go into at least negotiation with the tenant.\nSpeaker 1: And dangerous to point out, this was a mutual agreement. Both the city and the tenant have correct.\nSpeaker 5: They have signed the agreement.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: You, Councilman Herndon, Councilman Seelbach you back up more questions.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. So can you clarify these incidents? Did they happen on the premises that we leased to this this tenant or did it happen, I think you said, in the adjacent public parking lot?\nSpeaker 5: So they're a little bit different per for the four incidents. Some of them were actually outside of the leased premises. There was a firearm that was shot into the leased premises. Some of them actually happened in the garage itself.\nSpeaker 5: So it depends on which incident we're referring to. But they all happened after 2:00 in the morning when this particular business establishment lets clients out for the evening.\nSpeaker 4: Were the police able to directly connect any of these incidents to the tenants of this establishment?\nSpeaker 5: So I don't know. Commander Sanchez is here. If he wouldn't I don't know if he would like to address that on on behalf. But we have created a nexus between, again, when the clients in the leave to when we are having these incidents happen shortly after 2:00 in the morning.\nSpeaker 4: Do they pay for extra security? Were they required under any previous agreements to pay for extra security for a public parking space that is not part of their lease?\nSpeaker 5: So in the previous arrangement, so prior to the one that's in front of you, they were required to have off duty officers both in the premise as well as they were doing wanding and bag checks. But we were finding what's happening is that after the club let out that people were going to their vehicles and perhaps getting\nSpeaker 5: their firearms from their vehicles. And that's when we were having those issues.\nSpeaker 4: You say perhaps is that a theory or was that proven?\nSpeaker 5: I believe that was the case that was proven. But again, we have four different incidents. So I can't speak to the each that each individual one.\nSpeaker 4: Who could confirm whether that's an idea or a theory or was it proven.\nSpeaker 5: I would invite Commander Sanchez.\nSpeaker 6: If he can come up.\nSpeaker 4: While we wait for him. Are there any other minority owned businesses in that area under the DCP?\nSpeaker 5: This is the Denver Performing Arts Complex. And there are not.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Thank you, Commander Sanchez.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Good evening, everybody.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm sorry. Could you just introduce yourself for the folks watching on TV?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, sir. My name is Aaron Sanchez.\nSpeaker 10: Denver Police Department commander.\nSpeaker 0: Of District Six. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Yes, ma'am. So. Most of those cases are still in the adjudication process. So I guess.\nSpeaker 10: Technically they they are.\nSpeaker 3: An unproven theory at this point. However, since January, we've had 71 incidents, 173 calls for service. Of those, 125 of those have been 911 or non-emergency calls. So it's it hasn't been that the police are there, proactive policing.\nSpeaker 3: They're responding to 911 calls. 50 of those calls have occurred after 10 p.m.. So I guess in regards to the theory to the west of Onyx is Hotel Teatro and then to the to the west and to the north is the Four Seasons and then to the east is the DCP complex.\nSpeaker 3: So after about 10/30, maybe 11:00, the DCP crowd is gone for the evening. Just by the nature of hotel, theater and the Four Seasons is probably not a lot of calls in regards to disturbances, fights and things of that nature.\nSpeaker 3: Since January 1st, we've had 12 assaults, eight of those simple assaults, three of those the aggravated assaults, those that George was just talking about, and also one sex assault, forcible.\nSpeaker 4: And so we heard all of these reports and we asked which ones were directly connected to this establishment. We were told that only let's see, I think it was two or four were directly complaining about that establishment and then the rest were in the general vicinity of the area, which is a downtown area, really close to a\nSpeaker 4: lot of different things, near a parking lot that's used for a lot of the nightclubs and different things around in that area. And so thank you for your testimony. No further questions. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. All right. So no other questions or comments, Madam Secretary.\nSpeaker 5: Raquel CdeBaca.\nSpeaker 4: No Black Eye.\nSpeaker 0: Flynn I.\nSpeaker 9: Gillmor, I.\nSpeaker 5: Herndon Hines.\nSpeaker 7: High.\nSpeaker 5: Cashman.\nSpeaker 10: I.\nSpeaker 4: Can EJ.\nSpeaker 5: Ortega Sandoval.

        "source": "Speaker 0: I'm going to wait for one more member to approve those minutes. Well, turn to item eight. Is that our best action item? Okay. We'll go to item eight. Item eight is an ordinance which will improve the grant funding allocations for our Water Works program.\nSpeaker 0: This is round three of this very popular and successful program. These are sewer rate funded projects to address water quality improvements. The rate includes. What is it like about $3.6 million per biennium as at 1.8 per.\nSpeaker 3: It's about two 2 million for this portion of the program. Now that there is a council portion of the program in the separately executive portion. So this is the executive portion.\nSpeaker 0: Right. So in this this this half of it goes through the recommendation committee.\nSpeaker 3: The grants rank and committee.\nSpeaker 0: That's correct. And those are the recommendations that are before us.\nSpeaker 3: That's correct.\nSpeaker 0: All right. And we're going to be joined by a representative to present the recommendations.\nSpeaker 2: Right.\nSpeaker 3: You've largely captured what I was going to present. So I think I'm I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Working out of my class there.\nSpeaker 3: I think I'll just just introduce Elizabeth Louden, who's the Water Works program manager for the water program. She will give you a briefing, as you indicated here, this is based on water, on water and wastewater treatment division funding.\nSpeaker 3: And from there, I turn to Elizabeth.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Mike. Thanks for your work. Welcome, Elizabeth.\nSpeaker 1: Good morning. Good morning. And thank you for inviting me. I'll be just offering a some brief comments on the water grant program and the current round before you. The overall goal of water works is to fund projects that improve water quality in the Wastewater Treatment Division's service area.\nSpeaker 1: The program also has additional benefits, including community involvement, building stewardship and leveraging funding. To date, 82 projects have been funded totaling $5.8 million, and that's for both the competitive and the council allocated projects. Project types include green stormwater infrastructure.\nSpeaker 1: Rain gardens and cisterns. Education and community engagement. Research and monitoring. And stream and riverbank restoration. Most projects include more than one type of activity, and as mentioned, there are two different tracks for funding. The competitive and council allocated.\nSpeaker 0: Are very competitive to.\nSpeaker 1: Ensure they are for the competitive track. The Grant Ranking Committee reviews applications and makes recommendations. And this year for the competitive track, we have a biennial cycle which will award all the funding for 2017 and 2018. And also this year, we had a two step process.\nSpeaker 1: Letter of intent, short pre application and then a full application. We started with 80 proposals and then the 23 before you were considered by the committee to be the the best ones.\nSpeaker 0: And are these before us as the committee recommended, or were there any changes between committee recommendation and submission to the council?\nSpeaker 1: There were a couple of changes. There was one project that was proposed initially proposed by a wastewater treatment division that the committee recommended, and then subsequently the management decided that their preference was to have the funding go to outside entities.\nSpeaker 1: So the committee reconvened for another session to decide what to do with that $113,000 and decided to awarded to two other projects which are on the list. The last two projects on the list. Yeah, great. So that was the one change that was made.\nSpeaker 1: So the round three recommended projects list starts on page 50 of your packet, and there are 23 projects totaling $1.86 million. There's a wide variety in project types, in size of projects that also location and I, things that are different this round.\nSpeaker 1: The recommended projects include 11 organizations that have not been previously funded by Water Works and two led by Native American organizations. So overall, this $1.86 million in water works funding is leveraging another $6.8 million in match, both cash and volunteer time.\nSpeaker 1: So this represents a significant community investment in water quality improvements.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent. Do members have questions or comments on this item? Councilmember Building.\nSpeaker 1: I'm still kind of going through the analysis here, but there's a series of grant programs that we do repeatedly where I'm very concerned. Turn that my district gets very shortchanged. And this is one of them. And I'm just going through the math here, and I haven't been able to work all the way through because there's not a\nSpeaker 1: summary by district. There's kind of a general. And and I just want to point that out. It's it's concerning to me because the first year when I had this comment, our chairman pointed out, and I thought quite correctly and wisely, that these things come and go in cycles, and some years you're going to get less, some years\nSpeaker 1: you're going to get more. But I'm on year three now and I'm just not seeing that there's a fair distribution to my district, so I'm concerned about that.\nSpeaker 3: I might briefly note, Mr. Chair, that that on page one, page 71 of your packet, there is a listing of projects, and you will see on that fourth column from the left that there that it's defined by district.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I'm busy sorting through that right now and trying to do it because it's not totaled up my district. And so I'm doing math and spreadsheets over here, which is probably not a good activity on my part, but it just I'd like to know what what's being done to make sure that there's a fair distribution of this\nSpeaker 1: money. So I can respond that that the committee does look at the geography of where the projects are. And so what we do is we look at the we ask the applicants what districts their project takes, takes, takes place.\nSpeaker 1: And that's where we have this information from the table here. And many of the projects take place in more than one district. So we do put we put together a map, kind of a preliminary map showing where the different projects were.\nSpeaker 1: We are also limited by where the applicants are coming from. So. But I did look at all of them because I know that there was a question about this earlier. I did look at all of the projects in the final list, the final 23, and just to see how many were only in Seattle versus outside of Seattle\nSpeaker 1: . And the numbers on that were 21% of the projects recommended for funding were in Seattle. And then.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: Almost have about 45 were in multiple districts. And then another chunk, 30 something percent, were entirely outside of Seattle. So. That's helpful. But is there outreach to make sure people are applying? Is there is there a way of making sure, maybe by mapping out where these are, that things are being spread fairly?\nSpeaker 1: Do we look back over five or ten years and see where there are gaps and try to fill those gaps? I mean, I'm asking more of a process question. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. And we're I'm happy to do outreach.\nSpeaker 1: We have workshops that we've done in different locations around the county, and I'm happy to do presentations if people have suggestions on where I might present on what works opportunities.\nSpeaker 3: So Mr. Chair, if I might suggest I'd be happy to work with the agency if it's possible to take a look over the last several years and do a basically a spreadsheet analysis of where money has gone in terms of districts and how it has been balanced over over time as a resource for your information.\nSpeaker 1: I think that would be really helpful. And then maybe we can think about doing it because before you. So I appreciate offers, but before I personally or asked my colleagues to ask for specific work, it would be nice to do a little bit of an analysis to see if my perception is correct, first of all.\nSpeaker 1: Second of all, if so, why? And then what is what would be the best way to address whatever the issue is? Okay. So I wouldn't ask you to run right out and do that right away. And I do appreciate the offer.\nSpeaker 1: But let's see if we can do a little analysis about what's really going on and why. Thank you, Mike. I appreciate that. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember LDC and Councilmember Coleman Wells might remember better than than me as former chair of the Regional Water Quality Committee, but I had some similar concerns the first time this came out, and we prepared some legislation to kind of help shape the technical or the recommendations committee.\nSpeaker 0: Right. In terms of having council members suggest representatives. Yeah. And do either of you recall if you type of how we structured that and whether each district get a representative and how are we doing on filling those? I think I know I've got my person.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. So very briefly, there is a grand ranking committee, as you're referring to, that Grant's ranking committee does. I believe there are nominations from each of your offices to the council district offices, which go to the executives executive appoints them to the to that committee.\nSpeaker 3: And I am not in fact, I was going to ask what the what. She's got.\nSpeaker 0: The list.\nSpeaker 1: I've got the list. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: So why don't we before we let's not call out any vacancies in case there there. But if there are council members who have not got their representative to you, why don't you let those officers know offline?\nSpeaker 1: Do you have to do that? Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: That was one solution because, well, gee, I'm not sure it's the most effective. You know, it's just one way to have a voice at the table, which is part of the process. Obviously, I think it would be interesting to see on the denominator, if you will, where all the applications came from in terms of determining that that\nSpeaker 0: equity. And I think that could be rather readily transmitted. And the other piece of this was to ensure that equity we got these funds in half. So there is the council side. What is the will of the body on this today?\nSpeaker 0: Are folks ready to move forward either with or without recommendation? Is there any timing issues? I mean, I know what, by not approving it, we're holding up the funds.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, ahead. So for timing issues, let's see. So the initial letters of intent were submitted in June of last year and then went through the review process. So we did tell people, I think people are hoping to be able to get started this summer and some of the projects to have a seasonal aspect to them this year\nSpeaker 0: . Window.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Mm hmm. What do you think, customer value. Will you be able to get the information you want between now and two weeks? Or would you like this to remain here?\nSpeaker 1: I, I don't know. Let me look to Missouri. Do you think we can do some work on this between now and two weeks from now?\nSpeaker 3: I would certainly start today to work with the agency, and I'll look to see whether whether you can produce information that would be needed for that sort of an array over the next, let's say, week. Yes, sure. We can do that.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All right. Customer McDermott, it's your legislation.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would move that we give you a do pass recommendations and a full council, he said, looking at the ordinance number ordinance 2018, 149.\nSpeaker 0: All right, that's before us. Further questions or comments this customer about.\nSpeaker 1: To say, I'm going to vote no on do pass, but I might get there by final count. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, very good. The clerical cultural on.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

It'll go in the ordinary course, which will allow a couple of weeks, and even if necessary, a courtesy delay for a third week. It sounds like that's reasonable information that could be gotten quite probably, and I'd appreciate a copy of it to our office as well\nSpeaker 0: . Maybe all offices, I'm hearing, to take a look and appreciate Councilmember Bowdich duties, diligence in making sure there's a balance in these grants. Thank you for your work and for being here.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We are going to turn now to item nine, which is. Oh, the minutes. We like to put those before us.

Councilmember O'Brien, you have the floor.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Colleagues are going to take a few minutes to walk through some of the background of here of the work on this resolution and also highlight what comes next. I want to start by thanking Councilmember Herbold for her leadership in working on this through the Civil Rights, Utilities, Economic Development and Arts Committee.\nSpeaker 7: Back in September, we heard a report from the Seattle Women's Commission entitled Losing Home. You probably folks and you're probably familiar with that has been reported on in numerous times. The report included a review of all 1218 evictions, residential evictions, actions filed in Seattle in the year 2017.\nSpeaker 7: In addition, it did some studies. I also surveyed and interviewed tenants and interviewed homeless prevention providers cross rents, cross-referenced evictions with medical examiner records, and also cross-referenced with housing code violations. There are a number of findings in this report, and I want to touch on just a few of these findings.\nSpeaker 7: One of them was that single tenant households that faced eviction for $100 or less in back rent. Of those, 81% of those single households were women. If you're black, there was a 4.5% sorry, 4.5 times likelihood that you would face eviction than if you were white.\nSpeaker 7: People of color were more likely to be evicted for smaller amounts of money than white households. Of the over 1000 evictions, 86% were for nonpayment of rent. 52% of those were for less than one month's worth of rent.\nSpeaker 7: Attorney's fees were charged attendance in 90% of the cases and court costs were charged and over 92% of the cases. Those charges averaged just over $400 for attorney's fees and just under $400 for court costs. A Federal Reserve report found that 40% of Americans could not come up with $400 in the event of an emergency.\nSpeaker 7: When you listen to just these facts and there's a number of other findings, it should come as no surprise that the burden of evictions, often for very small amounts. And we didn't even go into some details of the reasons of these forward and the reality, financial reality that so many folks face, that it's clear that the eviction\nSpeaker 7: process in our city is broken. And it leads to a significant number of folks who go through eviction, facing homelessness, post eviction. Only 12.5% of evicted respondents found another rental. Over 37% were completely unsheltered. 25% were living in a shelter or transitional housing, and 25% ended up staying with family or friends.\nSpeaker 7: If we want to address our homeless crisis, there's really no way we can do that without also addressing the eviction crisis we're facing. This is not the first time that this council has taken up issues around eviction. Want to touch on a few of those?\nSpeaker 7: There was a number of statement of legislative attempts and green sheets that we passed in the past few years. Example Preventing evictions for substandard properties and creating a legal path for tenants to enforce their rights in court. We've passed green sheets, increasing coordinated funds for legal defense and tenant outreach funds.\nSpeaker 7: Recommended process for centralizing for obtaining assistance in one place, but without fundamental reform to the eviction process, will continue to see some of the challenges we facing. This resolution alone is not going to solve this crisis, but it lays out a path and a framework following on recommendations from the Women's Commission report that the city can take\nSpeaker 7: if we want to reduce this crisis. I'm going to touch on a couple of the next steps that are that we believe we can accomplish in the relatively near term, and that this resolution lays out the groundwork for us to move forward on some of those.\nSpeaker 7: One is to address financial hardship for tenancies piercing domestic violence, who often are held liable for damages caused by the perpetrator. We can address the lack of flexibility to avoid eviction when faced with emergencies. Hope to address high default rates for evictions arising from not understanding the eviction process or mutual termination agreements, which are often entered into\nSpeaker 7: in a one sided nature where the tenant doesn't understand their rights and responsibilities and what resources may be available to avoid eviction hardship for paying rent from an additional burden on top of late payments for rent, that late fees, court costs and attorney's fees compound and make it almost impossible for many folks to recover from late payment\nSpeaker 7: . Also, the courts generally have not have the flexibility to exercise judicial discretion to prevent evictions. We heard in public testimony today of a woman in South Carolina who was in the hospital and so was unable to make payment in our state.\nSpeaker 7: She would have three days to pay or vacate. And the reality that someone who was in a hospital would be able to respond to that in any meaningful way is almost nil resulting likely resulting in our system in an eviction.\nSpeaker 7: Whereas in other jurisdictions there's at least a path where family members or advocates can show up in court, explain the circumstances to a judge in a judge could say, under these circumstances, I'm not going to proceed with this.\nSpeaker 7: Rarely do we see that flexibility in our system. Colleagues, I ask for your support on this resolution. I want to thank the Seattle Women's Commission for their work on making this happen, bringing forward and highlighting this, and recognize that there's a lot of work in front of us.\nSpeaker 7: And I want to thank folks in Olympia who are also taking this seriously, in large part because of the work that our Women's Commission did, to highlight some of the the circumstances that we face. This is not just, of course, in Seattle, but it's happening throughout the region.\nSpeaker 7: I believe Piers King in Sandwich County account for about half of the evictions in Washington State. And so we were able to address this just in the central Puget Sound region. It would go a long way to helping the people of the entire state.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Catherine and Brian Catherine back show.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilmember Brian, I certainly support your work here. Thank you for you and Councilmember Herbold and Swann for the work you've done in your committee. Can you tell me when you said that you're working with Olympia, what actions are are being taken?\nSpeaker 3: Is there legislation that's introduced now? And who are the key sponsors?\nSpeaker 7: The there are multiple pieces of legislation that are in play in Olympia right now, and I am not going to be able to speak at length to the details of them. The current state law has a three day paid vacation and is there bills that would both allow 14 or 21 days?\nSpeaker 7: I believe Representative Macri is supporting legislation that would extend it to 21 days, but there's a Republican sponsored bill that would be 14 days. But I would suggest that that at our next briefing, when we have our offer.\nSpeaker 7: Office of Immigrant Relations for them to speak to the variety of bills that are down there. Senator Krueger is also working on a series of bills about eviction. I think what I will say at the high level, Councilmember Bagshaw, is what's really apparent in Olympia this year is there's bipartisan support to address this crisis around evictions.\nSpeaker 7: And and so regardless of what community you're coming from, people are seeing this as a real problem. And, well, I know advocates have been working on this for years. It appears that there is a higher likelihood this session that we might see some traction on it.\nSpeaker 7: That doesn't relieve the city from doing some work, too, because there's a role for us to play. And the legislation that Councilmember Herbold has led on this resolution, I think helps lay out those next steps, too.\nSpeaker 0: Very good. Any further comments? Councilmember Mosquito.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, Mr. President. I just wanted to take a quick second to thank Councilmember Herbold and Swan O'Brien. Everybody who's had a hand in this legislation in Washington can so choose, right. We here in Seattle are embarrassingly behind where other cities and states are in terms of the eviction policy.\nSpeaker 1: I also wanted to take a quick second to thank the Seattle Women's Commission, the Housing Justice Project, for all of the work that they put into the losing home report. The eviction process and the landlord tenant law here is at best complex.\nSpeaker 1: And I think, as we've heard today, as truly unjust in terms of clarity, we lack clarity for landlords. We also lack clarity for tenants. And having the opportunity to clarify this, to create a more just system to work with tenants and advocates in the courts to find the path forward, not only as the process that will result\nSpeaker 1: for better clarification for all parties, but will help us continue the work of what we heard just two weeks ago on the Select Committee, that we need to do a much better job to provide easier and quicker assistance to prevent individuals from being evicted.\nSpeaker 1: If an individual calls and they said they need $200 and they need $400 just to get through the next few months, don't make them go through a rigorous process. Just allow them to be the best managers of their situation and help them get through that tough period so that they don't get evicted.\nSpeaker 1: This is what the experts are telling us from across the country, and it's what the experts on the ground level have been saying for so long. I'm really excited to work on this. We also know that this, in conjunction with additional tenant protections and building housing, is really the solution that goes hand in hand.\nSpeaker 1: We know that housing discrimination and risk of eviction increases when there is not enough affordable housing, when there is low vacancies, and when we don't have enough affordable units for those in need. So as we work to build additional housing, I'm really excited that we are going to be able to begin the process of legislating this intentional\nSpeaker 1: work around protecting our tenants.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Casper Mosquito Council members who want.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, President Harrell. I would urge those of us who haven't been able to look at it yet to watch the really important testimony that was given during the public comment section of the committee last week when government was horrible, the brain injury.\nSpeaker 6: When we voted this resolution out of the committee and I really hope everybody will be voting yes on this resolution in preparation for the ordinances that need to come following this. Some of you may have also read the study conducted by a commission by the Seattle Women's Commission with the support of trans rights activists from the Washington\nSpeaker 6: Community Action Network. And of course, most importantly, the Housing Justice Project. This is you know, I don't often recommend, you know, that people read greetings, but this is actually very, very useful because it has statistical information on how bad the crisis is.\nSpeaker 6: And it is not a small thing. It is and it is something that is happening citywide. And we know that most people who are affected in Seattle do not even have a lawyer present. And in fact, these numbers are based on people who went to court.\nSpeaker 6: We know that statistically speaking, there are a lot more who didn't go to court because they don't have the resources or the time or the support social support structure to go and challenges in court. So clearly, this is a very important issue.\nSpeaker 6: I'm really happy that to the people's budget movement last year we were able to win city funding for the first, first ever city funding for of eviction, you know, for for for attorneys to help with renters who are facing eviction.\nSpeaker 6: But that is far from enough. We need much more than that. And we know also the terrible impacts of eviction, the renters. And that's where this report is also very useful. Not only do evictions affect people's health stress, I mean, people have, you know, really compelling stories of how it affects their life long held because of the\nSpeaker 6: stress that they go through, how it affects their children and their future housing prospects, because it follows you everywhere you go. And we also know that deadly connection now that has been established between evictions and homelessness and even death in some cases, and not all.\nSpeaker 6: And, you know, last but not least, a connection between race and other issues that people face, other oppression that people face, and the likelihood of being evicted, likelihood of facing homelessness. And just to look at the numbers on average, and this study shows us this in 2017, there were almost three evictions every day in Seattle and in\nSpeaker 6: District three, which has Capitol Hill, the Central District, many working people living in the district. Evictions happen more than once every two days. So these are just stark numbers we are looking at for a city like Seattle. And as was stated by other, you know, renters in other states actually have many rights and eviction court and Washington\nSpeaker 6: state is lagging like far, far behind. So obviously, I will be supporting this resolution. But most importantly, I think renters need to continue to get organized to make sure the ordinances that are developed following the resolution also get passed.\nSpeaker 6: And as part of organizing, I would really urge everybody who is watching this to join my office by Seattle and Tenants Union of Washington State in the number of boot camps, renters rights bootcamps that we're having. Just this past Saturday, we had a boot camp at Vermillion and on Capitol Hill, and we had a number of renters\nSpeaker 6: come there not only to learn about their rights and the specific questions they had. And there's some horror stories with corporate landlords, but also how to get organized. In fact, there was a point where one of the people who was attending there said, hey, when are we going to talk about organizing?\nSpeaker 6: Which is, you know, very, very it's really it's really gratifying to see that renters are realizing that this is something that they need to get organized around. So just very quickly, I wanted to say that in the Central District will be having another renters rights bootcamp on Thursday, February 7th, at 630 at the Garfield Community Center.\nSpeaker 6: We're having two renters rights boot camps in the University District one on February 9th, which is a Saturday at 10 a.m., and on February 13th on at 6 p.m., which is a weekday. And you can find all this information by contacting my office.\nSpeaker 6: And we are also hosting a special renters rights boot camp that will focus on LGBTQ questions and how LGBTQ renters can get organized. That will be on Capitol Hill on March 6th. I think I might be getting the date wrong, but it will be at the Wildrose Bar on Capitol Hill.\nSpeaker 6: So please join us and let's get organized.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Swann. Okay. Any further comments or questions? Okay, let's take it to a vote. Those in favor of adopting the resolution. Please vote i i those opposed vote no. The motion carries the resolutions adopted. Cheryl, sign it.\nSpeaker 0: That's all. If you're watching that closes for you two, particularly for you, please read the next agenda item into the record.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 2: Thank you very much. And I know our public works director made a note as well. I saw him actively writing. Great. So thank you for that. I'm going to go back to the hearing, Mr. Modica.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. The staff report will be given by Linda Tatum and her group.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening, Mayor, and members of the city council. This is a public hearing for a project. It located at 2610 North Lakewood Boulevard. It is a project for a new hotel. And the the subject hotel is at 2016, North Lakewood.\nSpeaker 1: And it also includes properties at 41, 41 through 4217 Willow Street. The actions that we're asking the city council to take on this new hotel proposal include a conditional use permit, a site plan review, and to accept a mitigated negative declaration.\nSpeaker 1: Like to give a brief presentation on the project. This is a vicinity map that shows the current zoning of the property and the location. What you're seeing there is the four or five freeway at the Lakewood Street Interchange and shown in green there with the arrow is the proposed project site at the site.\nSpeaker 1: There is a a an existing gas station that is adjacent to the hotel which surrounds the gas station at that northeast corner of Lakewood and Willow Street. I'd also bring to your attention on the other side, on the west side of Lakewood Boulevard, there is an existing commercial car wash and retail establishment.\nSpeaker 1: Next. As I said on this project site, the proposal is a new 13 storey in an existing Holiday Inn 13 storey, but also is a vacant two storey hotel that was constructed back in 1978. The proposal before you tonight is the approval of the requested discretionary actions that will allow the existing two storey hotel to be demolished\nSpeaker 1: . And they would construct a new six storey hotel and a new two level parking structure on the site where the existing two storey hotel is to be demolished. So again, the entitlements are requested that are being requested are a zone change, a site plan review and a conditional use permit.\nSpeaker 1: Just a little bit of background. The zone change is to request an expansion of the existing PD 27 zoning on the adjacent property. That existing PD covers the site that shown to the left there in black. And that's essentially a plan development project that allows hotel and limited commercial retail in that project area.\nSpeaker 1: The proposal is to expand that PD 27 to include the subject property on the right that's shown in the red, which would be the subject of the new hotel site. And again, the the existing property owners have for not only the hotel site, but the gas station as well as the property adjacent on the other side, on\nSpeaker 1: the west side of Lakewood have approved consented to the requested zone change. A little bit of detail about the proposed project. It is a new six story hotel project with 125 GUESTROOMS. It also has some amenities. Those amenities include additional conference room space.\nSpeaker 1: There is also a new fitness facility in the in the hotel room there also including a new a new parking structure that will be atop the existing at grade parking. So it will essentially be a two level parking structure for a total with a total of 385 parking spaces.\nSpeaker 1: They will also add a new outdoor pool area and enhance the existing landscaping on the site and around the entire property. This next slide shows the configuration of the site. You can see the existing the round building is the existing Holiday Inn that will remain and you can see the configuration of the parking just to the east\nSpeaker 1: of that. You can also see the enhanced the green areas of the enhanced landscaping areas. You also see that they are requesting the closure of one of the driveways on Willow. And you can again see the two level parking structure and of course, the location of the outdoor pool, which is just north of the existing Holiday Inn\nSpeaker 1: . And again, just briefly, you can see the building elevations, the six stories. They've you can see the modern architectural style with the two tones of the color and the accent banding and the spaniel class that surrounds the property.\nSpeaker 1: It's been designed to complement the existing Holiday Inn structure or to complemented. Also like to just summarize the environmental action that was done on this project in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act. We staff completed, along with a consultant, we completed a mitigated negative declaration for the project.\nSpeaker 1: The public review period was from November 16th through December 16th, and staff did receive a couple of comments from public agencies during that review period. And there were two mitigation measures incorporated in the project. Those two mitigation measures dealt with cultural resources, requiring monitoring of any of any disturbance of the soil on the project site and observance\nSpeaker 1: or having monitoring done by Indian tribes. The other mitigation that was required was related to any disturbance of the soil during the excavation and that no construction or other soil disturbance would be carried out during breeding season to make sure that there are no nesting birds on the site at the time construction occurs.\nSpeaker 1: Those were the two mitigation measures, and with those mitigation, the Planning Commission considered this project on December or I'm sorry, January 19th of 2017, and they unanimously recommended approval of this project. And staff is recommending that the City Council uphold the Planning Commission's recommendation for approval of this project.\nSpeaker 1: I would note that we had there were no public comments during the the period since this project has been posted online. And I would like to acknowledge that closes staff's presentation. But we do have our environmental consultant available as well as the case planner, Gina Cassius, who did the work on this project.\nSpeaker 1: That concludes staff's presentation.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, I think, for that presentation. We're going to go ahead and go first to any public comment on this case. No public comment on this issue and the council comments. Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. We are very excited about this project. I know that it has been in the works for several years and it has taken a few different. Changes along the way, but we're very excited to have this new opportunity and additional places for people to stay.\nSpeaker 1: It is very difficult to find a room on the east side near the airport now with the amount of business that's going on. And we're very proud to have our new corporate partners and our corporate partners do trainings from individuals all across America and sometimes international, and they come to Long Beach to be trained.\nSpeaker 1: And so these are great facilities for them to stay at, especially for those longer term stays, especially for their trainer. So we're excited about this project. Thank you for the work that's been done both by the team at Holiday Inn and the support that they've received from the Convention and Visitors Bureau and the support that they've received\nSpeaker 1: from the city staff to make this a fair and balanced project that takes all needs into consideration. I think we have come up with a solution that meets everyone's needs. So if you haven't made it there to see the first revision, we did a ribbon cutting for the Holiday Inn tower several months ago, and I look forward\nSpeaker 1: to a groundbreaking and ribbon cutting for this facility.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Council member Supernormal.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. This area of the fifth District borders the fourth and has kind of a quirky sense because our border is is the four or five freeway. But in this one section, the border changes to Willow Street for a couple of hundred yards.\nSpeaker 0: So the property is in the fifth District. But a lot of my constituents ask me about this all the time. I just wanted to ask staff. I know during a construction period, especially something of this magnitude, you would meet with the police department and work out the September requirements.\nSpeaker 0: And September is an acronym that stands for Crime Prevention through Environmental Design. And prior to construction starting this, these meetings will take place and you work out all the details. And our police department or in particular has its Espinosa officer in East Division, would work with the construction firm to make sure all security measures are in place\nSpeaker 1: . Yes. Council member of the the police department during the course of the site plan review for this project and every other development project, the plans are related to the police department. So PD has had the chance to review the plans prior to their being finalized and they had did provide comments to staff.\nSpeaker 1: Those comments have been reflected in the project design. However, it is generally my understanding that police may also be involved during the construction process just for general monitoring of the site as necessary.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. There's a motion in a second. Just want to make sure. For the planning staff. Just a note that the. The tower. The current tower has obviously a a lighting scheme that's pretty bright, which I know they've changed and upgraded recently.\nSpeaker 2: Which is which is fine. I just want to make sure that the new building that we're paying attention to, what the lighting is going to be for the new building, and so that the two are not in conflict, but that the lighting the lighting scheme is looks great both at night and during the day.\nSpeaker 1: Certainly they are. We can make sure that that gets addressed so that they are compatible.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Mayor. We need four separate votes on this item.\nSpeaker 2: Great. So we'll go in. We have we're going to take four separate votes. We've done public comment for the whole item. And so we have the first of those votes as a motion. In a second, please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 3: Motion passes.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. You can just please plug in for the second motion to this. You want to read this?

So we will move on now to item number 27.\nSpeaker 1: Item 27, communication from Vice Mayor Richardson, Councilwoman Allen, Councilwoman Sara Recommendation to direct City Manager to invest in community policy by working with Long Beach Police Department to provide options in the FY 23 budget for structural funding of the Neighborhood Works Program and an expansion of LAPD's Bicycle Beats program.\nSpeaker 0: Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to excited to bring this proposal forward this evening. It's summertime. We're off to a great summer. It looks like. You know, I was you know, we kicked off the wee bit. I tried out the wee bit myself.\nSpeaker 8: It is definitely a challenging obstacle course, but the parks are full. You know, the the events are happening and the concerts are happening and we're off to a great summer. But we need to do all that we can to just remember what the first six months of this year looked like and how we need to continue to\nSpeaker 8: invest in public safety. We are still in a recovery from the pandemic, and as we recover from the pandemic, we know that there's a recovery around public safety that we're continuing to invest in and we need to remain laser focused on.\nSpeaker 8: We have a lot of progress, a lot of lessons learned over the past two years. You know, the Long Beach advancing piece was a great example. This was community building and community outreach that started down in the AOC seven and West, the Washington neighborhood area.\nSpeaker 8: And last January, February, the city council asked them to bring it forward, to expand it to north and other parts of town. And that work was rewarded with a $3.9 million grant to expand a number of programs from safe passages to a whole host of things.\nSpeaker 8: That's all good. We support all those things. We also saw last year after a successful pilot of the the Neighborhood Walks program in the Washington neighborhood, some significant results. We saw and we saw upwards of 40% drop in shootings in the Washington neighborhood.\nSpeaker 8: Now, we can't say it was directly a result of the neighborhood walks, but there's a correlation there. The city council has to expand that program to North. So we did a pilot last summer and that program and that pilot in the summer, we also saw emergency calls reduced by 7.6%.\nSpeaker 8: And we saw that shootings dropped over 80% over the first two months of the summer. Now, again, we can't say that that was the direct result of that program, but we can't point to programs that the residents enjoyed, the residents thought were good steps.\nSpeaker 8: And look at that data and look at those best practices and say now is the time for us to go in and expand it. Now, we've also heard loud and clear from businesses in the community, from people who use our parks and park adjacent neighborhoods, that people want to see folks on bikes and walk in the beat\nSpeaker 8: rather than, you know, a cruiser pull up on Highland Park or cruiser pull up on a park. It just seems less threatening. It seems safer. And you build relationships with the people who are serving our community with law enforcement.\nSpeaker 8: So we know that bikes are less expensive and in fact, they're better on our environment. So you get a multiplier effect, less threatening, more engagement with the public, more public trust, better on our environment and more cost effective.\nSpeaker 8: Last year as a part of the safety recovery, we invested in four, I believe it was four additional. I think we did one per policing district. That's not enough. We're asking as a part of this proposal that one, we take the best practices we learned through the Neighborhood Walks program and the investment we did during the safety\nSpeaker 8: recovery into the into the Bike Beats initiative and expand that. I think it was called the Neighborhood Safe Streets Initiative in the Safety Recovery Plan, and we expand that citywide. Now, this request puts the number at 25. I'm flexible.\nSpeaker 8: It doesn't have to be the number 25. It could be more. It can be less. I think the idea here is if it was for last year, we want to see something across the whole city in a in a way that people actually feel the presence and see an investment program.\nSpeaker 8: And so as this proposal moves through the budget process, we want to see a more substantial commitment to community policing, these specific community policing programs. I believe that it's time for us to go all in. We've seen again, we've seen the evidence.\nSpeaker 8: We've seen with the data set about investing in these programs. We like it. We want to do more. If we expand the Neighborhood Walks program, the bicycle program, Neighborhood Safe Streets, as well as complement this recent investment, we have 3.9 million.\nSpeaker 8: That's doing a lot in some of the areas of needs in the hardest hit areas. We can see potentially see some really good things begin to happen. I think we should continue to look at data, but continue to make investments here.\nSpeaker 8: Residents have asked us to do more on violence prevention. This is one way that we can take a program that we've already done. It has proven that it works and rebuild public trust, rebuild you know, build trust and congruence with the community and the police department, particularly in underserved communities, and make a real impact on our communities\nSpeaker 8: . I want to just thank Councilmember Allen and chair public safety Councilwoman Sorrow for both partnering with me on this proposal. I hope the Council will continue to advocate for this and additional ways to contribute to the well-being of our entire city.\nSpeaker 8: I think Long Beach residents expect us to look at data and make smart investments into creating a truly safe and healthy city. And so that's my proposal. If the second year doesn't mind, I want to go to public comment or maybe we'll hear from the second.\nSpeaker 1: I'm following it's public comment and that's okay.\nSpeaker 8: All right. Is there any public comment on this item? I don't have.\nSpeaker 5: Anything for any members of the public that would like to speak on item 27 in person. Please enable the podium if there are any members of the public that would like to speak in the zoom, please use the raise hand feature in Zoom.\nSpeaker 5: We do have one speaker as Cruz. Your time begins now.\nSpeaker 7: And then.\nSpeaker 5: Please begin.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. I have been trying to get some help from the council over the past few years for this ongoing and I don't know what it feels like. Kind of like. Hitting direct attack in the community and be maybe in the gender of the city council member due to the damages that I've gone through extensively and directly had\nSpeaker 7: my own vehicle that was in my life literally, and I feel like I'm subjectively being broadcast for some reason on blue is throughout the city usually be institute or some type of ongoing. Um. I guess use that as an email to many of you and going to ask you why am I not getting help from this financial\nSpeaker 7: burden here? Long Beach. But in Riverside County as well as. We have so much to do that the police and the police each here have. Meaning within the implement. And so I know what to do.\nSpeaker 5: That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 8: All right. Thank you. We'll take it back behind the real councilwoman, Ciro.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Vice Mayor. I appreciate your leadership in bringing this item forward and Councilwoman Allen for sponsoring as well and as chair of the Public Safety Committee. You know, we've been having conversation about what does it mean to build trust, to increase transparency and accountability.\nSpeaker 1: And this is one of the program that was piloted in the aftermath of the framework for reconciliation being approved, and also ways that we can basically improve our relationships with our police department as well as our community. And I thought and we've been getting regular updates on it and it's been received really warmly in the community.\nSpeaker 1: And that's why I also agree that it's a great idea to expand it. I think that one of the last conversation we had at Public Safety Committee meeting was about more than just preventing violence. It's been advancing peace.\nSpeaker 1: And in order to do that, it's about connection. It's about building relationship. It's about engagement. And that's what exactly this Neighborhood Walks program does and just really appreciate the collaboration, collaborative effort our departments are taking with police and our fire department and our Health and Human Services and many others in how we're addressing ways to advance peace\nSpeaker 1: . And so I want to just think some of the neighborhood groups that have submitted a letter of support, such as the North Long Beach Neighborhood Alliance, that includes, it looks like two, four, six, eight, all ten of the neighborhood associations, as well as the Wrigley Neighborhood Association, president of the Belmont Shore Resident Association, the Fourth Street Business\nSpeaker 1: Improvement District, the Bluff Park Neighborhood Association, AOC Seven Neighborhood Association, as well as the Long Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau. So they appreciate them sending in letter support and their demonstration that they'd like to see more of this program being expanded and supported.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Next, we have Councilmember Cindy Allen.\nSpeaker 4: I. Yes. Thank you. Vice Mayor or just, you know, leads on this very important item. And I appreciate you allowing myself and Councilman Ciro to our to sign on to this. As a former police officer, I have worked around many my unit officers, and I know that they thoroughly enjoy the far deeper community engagement that they are\nSpeaker 4: able to have in that assignment. I saw that they had a different mission set than regular patrol officers and that they truly embraced the opportunity to build relationships and trust with the communities that they were assigned. And as a former business owner, both me and my staff love the bike units assigned to our area.\nSpeaker 4: They would frequently stop by and chat. Keep us posted on issues in the area and ask if there were any concerns. And now, as a councilwoman, I have heard from residents and business owners about how much they too appreciate seeing officers on foot and on bikes.\nSpeaker 4: So with all three lived experiences, I am a very strong supporter of this initiative and thank you to the officers who are already out there walking and biking and the beats of our neighborhoods. I have heard from folks in Zakaria and in downtown just about how much safer that they feel.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Councilwoman Sara, for reading off all of the all of the folks that are supporting this. So I won't do that. But I can tell you that our community feels safer and has a greater connection to officers when they just stop by and chat and say hi and just check in on on folks.\nSpeaker 4: I know that the residents of the Second District feel strongly that more community oriented walking and biking beats would improve the safety and just the community relations with our officers. I too have also received all these comments in letters and support.\nSpeaker 4: So I just appreciate so many folks from the second district who have written in. I appreciate that. What I what I'm also vice mayor would would like for the proposal from the department is just you know how are how are we going to or how do we plan to track the work of the new unit, and which\nSpeaker 4: includes the effectiveness of productivity, the amount of engagement? Just it would be nice for us just to have clear expectations from the chain of command and how that the council offices will be able to be briefed on this and provide some input for consideration.\nSpeaker 4: So just thank you again. I appreciate you, Vice Mayor, and I really am excited about this item. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Think you have some customers that are queued up. Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I love this item. Do we actually have a program called Bicycle Beats? Does the city manager. Can you answer that question?\nSpeaker 2: I asked the police chief to talk about that.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Councilmember. We don't have a program called bicycle beats per se, but we do have a bike unit that's assigned to it, currently assigned to the South Division.\nSpeaker 4: Right. And we have the commanders have the ability to make a decision about walking beats and bicycle beats. Right. I know that's something we talk to our commander a lot. And I agree that bicycle patrols are very, very popular.\nSpeaker 4: And I know that the commanders have some discretion in that. Can you talk about that a little bit?\nSpeaker 8: Yes, Councilwoman, the the commanders, the divisional commanders maintain operational control of their resources. So they do have the ability to do things like put officers out on the street to walk and bring officers into for bike patrols or community policing.\nSpeaker 8: However, that has to be based on their staffing and the staffing that they have available, because their priority is really calls for service in emergency response. So depending on the situation, the staffing they have available to them and the circumstances they do have the ability do to either use overtime, utilize overtime to do those things or create\nSpeaker 8: units within their divisions.\nSpeaker 4: That's great. So I know that this item asks for the city manager to incorporate some of these ideas in the city manager's budget. But I just want to get a sense of the timing. The city manager, you've already submitted your proposed budget to the mayor, is that correct?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. In the charter deadline, we have until July 1st to do that. So it has been prepared from the city manager's proposed budget and it is now in the comment period and review period from the mayor and will be released by the end of July and beginning of August.\nSpeaker 4: Now, I know the council, the full council hasn't had a chance to see that proposed budget, but I'm assuming some people in your office and the mayor's office have seen the proposed budget, is that right?\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\nSpeaker 4: And is there and I know you can't go into the details of the proposed budget, but I know the chief has been talking to us in public safety a lot about some of his community policing measures. Is a bike patrol measure already something that's included in the proposed budget that you've submitted?\nSpeaker 2: So I can't really get into specifics on the budget. We don't do that until we actually go through the full process and we have it released by the mayor with his recommendations as well. That said, we have a new police chief who's very much in favor of bike units, of neighborhood policing.\nSpeaker 2: He's been listening to what the council, the whole council has been talking about in this area. It's been a popular program. We've gotten some grants to be able to support this work in in various areas of the city, and it's proven to be effective.\nSpeaker 2: So we are looking at these types of components. And the police chief is going to have a proposal in the budget to look at how we kind of restructure within the police department as well as some additional resources that he'd like to propose as part of the manager's proposed budget.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. But that's the manager's proposed budget. That includes the police chief's recommendation that was submitted already on Friday, correct?\nSpeaker 2: That's correct.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. And then just in general, I want to make sure that I love love that we're finally advocating for adding to our police department. I know that some were hesitant to do that in the past, and I'm glad we're doing that and talking about it.\nSpeaker 4: But I also want to make sure that we don't impact our current patrol numbers, because I know that's an area that is causing a little bit of stress for our officers having sufficient patrol units. Is that something that in addition to the.\nSpeaker 1: Police.\nSpeaker 4: Chief's recommendations that are included in the budget that you've already submitted to the mayor for comment on, have we given consideration to how community policing efforts might impact or augment our patrol resources?\nSpeaker 2: So again, without getting into specifics, I do want to confirm anything we do in the budget is not going to affect patrol beat, so we're not going to be affecting what we currently have for patrol. In fact, it's going to be looking at other ways to augment some of that, some of that.\nSpeaker 2: So we're not taking from that area. We are looking at like the entire city budget where units are aligned. And so that'll be something the police chief will look at, but not patrol beats.\nSpeaker 4: That's great. Fantastic. That's what I wanted to know. But I wholeheartedly support this item and of course, pretty much any proposal that would add more officers to our department. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Ross. And please.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. You know, I have to say thank you to Jim divers who brought this item forward. You know, I think it's consistent with, you know, most of the city council members who have had the opportunity to work with over the last ten years.\nSpeaker 7: I have never heard one city councilmember or one person from the community say that they didn't want more community policing. Right. And so I think this is a really a no brainer to support. I certainly support community policing have always been supportive of community policing, but obviously knows how we apply that.\nSpeaker 7: Community policing takes a different approach and it also depends on resources. We need to make those resources available. As a city council, you know, I want to applaud Chief Luna and also our new chief of. While he wish we were forward thinking of in progressive ways, utilizing resources in making our police department work for our residents.\nSpeaker 7: I had an opportunity to participate early on with the neighborhood watch program. I actually walked the beat with the chief and the deputy chief at the time and in our commander. And the response was was tremendous. We can do more of this.\nSpeaker 7: We should. However, I do think that a Councilmember Ellen made a couple of good points related to accountability and basically tracking how these resources are going to be utilized. I think that's important. The question of what actually happened in the city manager is if we were to move forward with this as recommended, will this be done in\nSpeaker 7: overtime or utilizing overtime budget?\nSpeaker 2: So I think the item requires us to look at solutions. So we would be looking at what are the cost of doing something that's proposed and also what would the offsets be. And over time model could be one, it could be a structural solution as well with with officers not going to be reviewed in the budget.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you for clarifying that. And again, further clarity, I would just say, you know, items like this that are currently where we're projecting, you know, the FBI 23 budget is called out here in this letter. I do would recommend this this go ask for really amendment that this be referred to the budget oversight committee as well since\nSpeaker 7: we are going to be dealing with the details of our budget in FY 23, we expect to get a budget in the next few weeks from the city manager as well as the mayor. And I'm sure that this will be followed a robust conversations.\nSpeaker 7: And so my my recommendation would be that. Sinister budget oversight. We're going to get it one way or another. But I think the protocol for you're here on the city council is to ensure that, you know, items like this that have fiscal impacts go through the Budget Oversight Committee.\nSpeaker 7: And I'll just also comment on the council letter that brought this item forward again. And I commend the work I do. Just caution us. I don't I'm not sure that that less than a year worth of data is is really, you know, a number for us to draw our hats on.\nSpeaker 7: You know, we need to study this more. I'd like to get some real time numbers. And that's why one of the questions that I will be asking during a budget oversight committee is how much has this practice really impacted our communities, particularly where we know that it is having I don't know what the shooting numbers are.\nSpeaker 7: The latest update here was April 21. You know, there's a full year with the data for us to analyze and look at in terms of crime impacts overall. And so with that, I am supportive of this item. Again, I don't know anybody, every neighborhood association, every city council member, every city leader, every business leader that I know\nSpeaker 7: I'd love to see more community policing. You know, how we define community policing is important. You know, that's on bicycles, that's on Segways, that's walking the beat. I think that's all important. And those details are very important for us to where we are as a city council.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Have councilman's in the house.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to say thank you to Vice Mayor and Councilwoman Allen and Sara for bringing this item forward. As you know, in the first District, we've been lucky enough to have.\nSpeaker 1: Programs.\nSpeaker 4: Like this, very successful programs in our Washington neighborhood, which has really, really created a big impact. And so one of the things that I see is that no matter what part of the district you're in, in the first District, all of my residents are very much for community policing.\nSpeaker 4: We really want to know our police officers, we want to know, you know, we really want to get to know them on a personal level, especially our community leaders want to be able to have that that access to them.\nSpeaker 4: And I think that that's very, very important. So I just wanted to say that I'm very, very supportive of this item. And thank you for bringing forward.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman. Mango.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. If I could ask a few questions of Chief Bush. I appreciate your ambition with the word augmented. Where do we think we might get these police officers from? I guess I'm gonna ask a series of questions that kind of lead me there.\nSpeaker 3: How many officers are we budgeted for right now?\nSpeaker 8: So you're talking about our total budgeted officers for the department?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, sir.\nSpeaker 8: 803, ma'am.\nSpeaker 3: And how many do we currently have? Physical officers.\nSpeaker 8: So we're our actual numbers, which we we historically haven't put out because they change it based on injuries and deployments overseas for military, that type of thing. We're hovering around 740 right now.\nSpeaker 3: So we're 60 officers. Short.\nSpeaker 8: Approximately.\nSpeaker 3: And so. It sounds like taking beat officers and giving the commanders the flexibility they've always had to make those assignments is is one of the options. But I just want to be really careful. We're looking at a time in public safety with significant mental health challenges and overworked and family challenges that come from whether it's fire or\nSpeaker 3: police and any of those. And so I just want to be really cognizant of adding additional overtime on our current staff. They're really working a lot of hours. And I know that Monica mentioned all options. I think one of the councilmembers asked if it was overtime.\nSpeaker 3: I'm really thankful that you're not just looking to overtime. I think that there's also a big difference, at least in the data that we're seeing. So my other job in the difference in the culture of the new employees, you have your baby boomers who really drove to and really gravitated towards that over time.\nSpeaker 3: And our our younger generation is just not in that same mindset. And I think that the number one most important thing, and I think this really builds on what Councilman's and Day has said, is that those officers need to be in a fresh and community focused, engaging position.\nSpeaker 3: And that I will tell you, in my experience, if I was working in the Lakewood Mall, the constant community community engagement is a different type of shift than a shift, responding to calls. And it takes a different mindset.\nSpeaker 3: And I think it's really important for us as our police department that first and foremost, we're making those right decisions. And I know that every program that the council brings forward, we always think that the ideas we bring forward are the best ideas based on the community input we receive.\nSpeaker 3: But we do need that additional insight and support. So I look forward to seeing the proposal that was in Chief US City Manager Monica's budget to see what that looked like in your mind before getting the council input, because I know that you're really in tune with the officers.\nSpeaker 3: At least that's what I'm hearing from the boots on the ground. And I really appreciate that. Thank you for coming to our community meeting. And there's just a tone about what you're doing with our officers that I just want to keep that going and support it.\nSpeaker 3: As you've been doing such a great job so far. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I thank my colleagues for their feedback and their comments. And I want to make sure that all of that is sort of incorporated here. And I'll enumerate just a few things that I heard.\nSpeaker 8: But, you know, it's great to see that, you know, everyone and it was never a question. You know, the whole council supports community policing. I think we just have some data in the past two years that really showed that the public likes it too and the public likes and I was out there, you know, with our commander\nSpeaker 8: , you know, during the neighborhood walks, it felt really good. And we want to start you want to make that structural. We want to invest in that because we had a very difficult two years. So the more we can have people out walking the beat, if you notice the larger support also have business improvement district saying the very\nSpeaker 8: same thing. You know, folks in downtown saying we need help. Sure, we have bid we have bid security. But, you know, we want to see our, you know, police be helping us out. And I know and you know, the last program, they called it the Neighborhood Safe Streets.\nSpeaker 8: Your website says a number of things on the patrol bureau, says bicycle beats, says K-9 beats. So we just pick bicycle beats off your website because it sounded cooler. But whatever you want to call it, Mr. Chief, call it whatever you like.\nSpeaker 8: The data suggestion, I think. What was that with that councilman zero on the data. No, it was Councilwoman Allen. So absolutely whatever mechanism we can do, I think people want to know that we're making investments that are smart and and produce the results that we hope that they will produce.\nSpeaker 8: So tracking data and all of that makes a whole lot of sense. So if we could put some thought into that, how you can make sure that happens in the budget would be great. This conversation of overtime versus structural, I typically I would prefer structural, but I know you have to figure out what you have to figure\nSpeaker 8: out. So I'm just interested in find out how you're going to approach it. And the last thing on also going to the Budget Oversight Committee. Absolutely. That's been our process in the past. And I don't know why we would deviate from that.\nSpeaker 8: And so we also, you know, will hope that the EEOC takes this takes this discussion out. And so I'm happy to accept those things. And thank you for this discussion. That concludes my comment. I urge and I vote.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I just want to make a couple of comments. I think all the council has made their comments and I think we've concluded public comment as well. Obviously, I believe that we received a mr. Mica, your budget recommendations for, I believe, Friday of last week, and so I have not yet reviewed them personally.\nSpeaker 0: I look forward to doing so this week and I think we can have our first meeting on those recommendations and I look forward to working on that budget as is presented to the Council in the next few weeks as we're looking forward to getting it out to the public for public comment and input.\nSpeaker 0: I will just say broadly speaking, and I've been talking with former Chief Luna and certainly with Chief Kibosh, I've been a huge proponent of additional police officers on bicycles. It's something that I've talked to you, Chief, since your first day on the job.\nSpeaker 0: And I've been talking to talking to Chief Luna as well. The more that police officers are accessible on bicycles, patrolling, walking neighborhoods, I think they really speak to a community approach to policing. That's very welcome. I know. And I think it's important to always note that there are different types of needs in policing, and oftentimes with response\nSpeaker 0: times and other needs, there are obviously adjustments have to be made. And it's up to you and your team to figure out what works and what approach works where. But any time that you're able to bring in more folks on the street and certainly more more embedded with a community and a neighborhood, I think is really, really\nSpeaker 0: important. And so I want to just think the department for having really invested in walkability and have invested in community policing over these, particularly in these last year or two, I think there have been changes and shifts in the department.\nSpeaker 0: And I just want to thank you for your commitment to doing that and an encouragement to continue to do more. And so I also, of course, am supportive of what's in front of the council and what the council all said tonight as well.\nSpeaker 0: And so I just want to thank the department and everyone involved in supporting and continuing to support our community policing and bike policing programs. And with that, we have a motion and a second. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote.\nSpeaker 1: District one by district two.\nSpeaker 4: I. I.\nSpeaker 1: Three. District five.\nSpeaker 3: II.\nSpeaker 1: District six. By District seven, by District eight. District nine. II. The motion is carried.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And, Mr. City Attorney, we had an announcement on two items.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Mayor. Mayor, members of the council. We're requesting that item 28 be withdrawn this evening. The our understanding and the intent of Assembly Bill 481 is to have the list available for inspection by the public for 30 days prior to the Council's discussion on that.\nSpeaker 2: And it's come to our attention that the list was amended on Friday to add one additional piece of equipment. And we would we would ask that this item be continued to allow the revised list to be made public for the entire 30 day comment period and then be brought back to the council at that time.\nSpeaker 7: Make the motion.\nSpeaker 3: Second.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Seem as far Chadwick in the audience. I believe she's the point person on this one. It's my recollection that when the Denver portion of the construction of the 16th Street Mall went before the RTD board, they required full payment up front.\nSpeaker 0: Is that what this is? Right. What they. Bartsch had worked with the Department of Finance manager of special projects. But the RTD board did two weeks ago. Tuesday was passed a resolution feeling that they should not RTD should not front any money to municipalities for work they are doing for the municipalities, and that the money should be\nSpeaker 0: sent to them upfront for the work that they would then perform, which is obviously very different than what we've been doing for ever, because this is a time sensitive project in terms of moving it forward with the federal grant money we have or that RTD has received.\nSpeaker 0: We negotiated with RTD staff, and this is a 15 day turnaround payment. They will supply us invoices and within 15 days we will have a concurrent review of those invoices with RTD staff and pay RTD the funds based on those undisputed invoices.\nSpeaker 0: So they have the money in hand to pay the contractor within their 30 days. So was this funding? We anticipated the full amount in this year's budget. This is actually downtown funds. So again, it's a reimbursement. So this proposal for these intersections has been approved through the borough board.\nSpeaker 0: This is the figure that ties it in to RTD to get the money to RTD. What you saw in council was the usual 30 day. They would send us invoices every 30 days and we would pay them. And due to the our TDs change in position, we've had to realign it to be able to pay in 15\nSpeaker 0: . So what is this push to the back burner that we were going to use the funds? It doesn't. It doesn't. Everything is continuing on track. If this is approved second reading next week, RTD staff will take this out, said for bids on the street and hopefully we can get this project started prior to the November date when\nSpeaker 0: we have to start stop construction. So on the RTD project, it doesn't hold anything up on the dura side. No. What gets pushed on the back burner? Nothing. So the dirt project that art, the RTD project does the actual transit ways.\nSpeaker 0: And this money is for the intersection between the transit ways we're going to build. Rebuild. Great. Thank you. I have no further questions.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilwoman. Take it. Catwoman. Rap.\nSpeaker 5: Not so fast. I just am trying to. Because we did have a presentation at one time from Tracy Huggins. I believe in infrastructure or something. Is this the full cost of all five intersections?\nSpeaker 0: Correct. And we will not be building all five intersections. Based on the current construction costs that we're seeing across the city. We won't know how many intersections we will be building until the bids come back. Oh, okay. So we don't have to spend all of this.\nSpeaker 0: This allows us if another grant is received by our TD for the transit ways, it allows us money for future intersections. And again, it's a reimbursement. So it's not like money's spent and we'll never have it. It's put there.\nSpeaker 0: And then we go back to RTD and collect it.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. All right.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. Any other questions or comments on Council Bill two zero? All right, CNN. Madam Secretary, you want to tee up the last one? Accountability 091. Councilman Monteiro, you called this out pertaining to the National Western Center Master Plan.\nSpeaker 3: What would you like for us to do with this?\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. President.

Agenda Item three Council Bill 118 690 relating to the satellite department amending Section 21.40 9.0 40 of the state legislature to remove an exemption from eligibility to the utility discount program for tenants of federally subsidized housing with utility allowances, and to update and modify certain program provisions that can be\nSpeaker 2: overcome in the bill passed.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember on.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, President Harrell. So this is this council bill is the companion bill to the one that we just voted on. Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for your comments. It's exciting that we were able to finally vote on this expansion of the utility discount program.\nSpeaker 7: Just to add to the comments already made by Councilmember Herbold, we know that all the evidence from economic and sociological research shows that opt out enrollment programs work much better than requiring eligible people or households individually applied to subsidy programs like the UDP.\nSpeaker 7: And so, you know, this will removing this restriction, which is what this ordinance does, will enable the largest single expansion of the program since it was created. So this is exciting. And in addition to the people council member Herbold mentioned, I would also like to thank City Lights, Kelly and Wright and also the staff at the Public\nSpeaker 7: Utilities for, you know, working on this for years really, and being the driving force to make this a reality. And it's excellent that we've been able to negotiate this with Seattle Housing Authority. Hopefully it will only be the first step to a bigger auto enrollment.\nSpeaker 7: I think the statistics, especially from a new study from the University of Washington, shows that actually a majority of the households that could be eligible for this program are actually not enrolled yet. So hopefully this will only be the first step, not the last step.\nSpeaker 7: And I would encourage satellite to and public utilities really do hasten to do to expand enrollment by the end of the year and also in the coming years. And as was mentioned earlier, the Energy and Environment Committee has unanimously recommended to pass this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Are there any further comments? Please call the rule on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 1: Whereas I O'Brien Swan. I beg Sheila Burgess Gonzalez, I Herbold II Johnson, President Harrell II nine in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 0: Bill Pass and the chair will sign it. Next report, please.\n",

As I said, we're going to take the Landmarks Commission next item on your agenda, items ten, 11 and 12.\nSpeaker 0: I'll turn it over. We have three appointments to the Landmarks Commission to hand over briefly to Ms. Crackles office for a staff report.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, Council members. Leah crackles off the council staff materials for this item for the items ten through 12 begin on page 41 of your packet. The items were confirm appointments to the King County Landmarks Commission.\nSpeaker 1: For Adam, also Brooke Deen, alias and Candace Parker, Barbara Brooks, Tucker, me, all of whom are here today. Jennifer Meissner, the King County's historic preservation officer, is also with us. The landmark commission was established to ensure the preservation of King County's historic places, material culture and traditions for future, all future generations.\nSpeaker 1: It's a nine member commission comprised of volunteers with broad expertize in areas such as architecture, art, land use, historic preservation, archeology, education and history. And staff has not identified any issues with these appointments. But there is an amendment and title amendment for item 12, and I will turn it over to the chair for the interviews of the\nSpeaker 1: appointees.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Buchholz. I'll be with that. I'm going to move to invite Ms.. Brooks Tucker to introduce herself and speak to her background, which would be interested in bringing to the Landmarks Committee. And I want to acknowledge two from my colleagues from the beginning.\nSpeaker 0: They know that Ms.. Brooks Tucker has a time constraint. And so if you are brief, we will understand and I acknowledge you will need to leave shortly after you read your introduction.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Chair. I so appreciate the flexibility here. So so all of you know why my youngest has returned to school this week and it has been an emotional rollercoaster and so exciting for all of us here. So thank you for the flexibility because I have to run to pick him up from his shortened adjusted day.\nSpeaker 1: It's a new schedule for all of us. So a little bit about me. I am from Southern California. I moved up here to Washington with my husband as he was active in the Navy. Let's see, gosh, that was about 12 years ago and we lived on Whidbey Island.\nSpeaker 1: My background in education is in architecture and historical preservation. I grew up in a small town of Redlands, Redlands, California. It's a significantly historical town. And I, I really do feel like I got a lot of my values from that upbringing.\nSpeaker 1: And it's made me extremely interested in how architectural systems and how they relate to strong historical relevance and how that really shapes an economy. I think that's really made me obsessive, possibly about how we how we shape our communities through environment.\nSpeaker 1: And that's that's completely what's brought me here to the Landmarks Commission, among a few other things. Do you have any questions for me?\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I would open with a question if in fact I invite the subsequent appointees to address this, as well as the county works to improve our in continuous improvement around equity and social justice, and particularly around Indigenous peoples being on the traditional lands, the Puget Service peoples.\nSpeaker 0: And you speak to how the Land Committee can be mindful of a broad set of landmarks and not to one population.\nSpeaker 1: My initial response is is advertisement. I don't feel like there's enough knowledge that we exist. And I think that if that putting us more out there to the public, I think is a great start. I think that so I'm also I'm chair of the Planning Commission of Maple Valley.\nSpeaker 1: So it's been a fantastic experience watching you work. And first and foremost, what I have learned from that experience is that we are here to listen to the public. We are their voice and their liaison. And I think that that is also a significant step in bringing about equity.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Mindful of time. Any colleagues have further questions.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Scheer.\nSpeaker 0: Council member.\nSpeaker 1: Belushi Not a question, but since we have the applicant here and you've taken your time to speak to us, I just want to say I really appreciate people bringing their passion, their expertize and their their hours and labor to these volunteer positions.\nSpeaker 1: It really helps to make so many good things happen in King County to have people like yourself who are willing to volunteer. So thank you very much for your willingness to serve. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Speaking as the kindergartner who was in a panic, if my grandmother couldn't be seen to pick me up after school from the classroom windows. I want to make sure we look. We let you out in time. Anything else you wish to share with us before stepping out?\nSpeaker 1: Not as of right now, but I look forward to coming back to all of you and seeing all of your faces again.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much for joining us and making today work.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I'm Mrs. Meisner. I see you've turned your screen and you wanted. Are you just watching? Would you like to make a few introductory comments about the Landmarks Board and the appointees before us today?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, thank you. Thank you. Councilor McDermott, I just wanted to chime in to say how thrilled we are to welcome these new members to the King County Landmarks Commission. Each and every one of them brings such a passion for our work for preservation, for equity and vast experience.\nSpeaker 1: And I did want to note that that our program is in the middle of an equity and inclusion project in which we are doing additional research into some of our properties that were designated as landmarks many, many years ago.\nSpeaker 1: And their nominations did not really tell us an inclusive story. So we are getting ready to basically review those nominations and have they come back before the Landmarks Commission and and basically make sure that the full story of our committee members or community members are told.\nSpeaker 1: So we're very excited about that and help to spread the word and and encourage more nominations of properties that represent underrepresented groups. So thank you. Thank you for for taking the time to speak with our appointees today.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Chelios. Councilmember Dunn, did you have a question or comment? Just a quick.\nSpeaker 2: Comment. Jennifer, good to see you. I hope you're well. I just want to let you know and others know, Dana, in particular. I was just at the Black Diamond Historical Museum there along the old railroad tracks, and they were just a Chris was just yesterday, Dave Forester.\nSpeaker 2: They were just incredibly complimentary on the work that your group had done and helping them. They I walked through it and they just keep getting better and better. Lots of fantastic leveraging of local resources and it really is quite a facility that they put together.\nSpeaker 2: And they were very, very high praise of you, Jennifer. And folks, your work is wanted to say thank you because it's the kind of place that I'm eager to take my my kids to as soon as it opens back up again.\nSpeaker 2: So thank you, Jennifer. Oh.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much, Councilmember Gunn.\nSpeaker 0: And Mr. Chair. Councilmember Tomasky. Well, we're adding thanks. I, too, want to join Councilmember John thank Jennifer for her department's assistance in the city shoreline with helping designate with their landmarks commission the new not the new, but the the old Naval Hospital Chapel, which is tucked in there, a beautiful piece of architectural accomplishment that is now protected\nSpeaker 0: . And I know that the expertize and the findings from from our department there really help them. And the community's very excited. So we appreciate the contractual work you do for many of our citizens. And I want to call that out today and thank Jennifer Lamberti.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember, we have two more applicants. Are you very popular?\nSpeaker 1: Is very popular. And so I too want to join in and say thank you. The Aurora coffee shop. I'm sorry. The Aroma Coffee shop has brought new life to both city. It is just amazing and beautiful. So thank you for all your work on that and not giving up when there were issues that had to be overcome\nSpeaker 1: . And it's definitely worth it. And then I know that there's another bone that is completing the restoration on the Bone Again program. And every time I drive through the valley, these beautiful bones, I think, yay, Jennifer and her team.\nSpeaker 1: And then I have a little prayer that I got. I got to get Jennifer out here to see this one. So thank you for all your hard work in that year. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Chelios. The floor is yours. Good morning. Welcome. If you could offer a few words of introduction and speak to your interest in the Landmarks Board. And now you know what coffee shops bought Barnes and other landmarks with benefit mentioned.\nSpeaker 0: Mean if you're trying to secure votes to win confirmation.\nSpeaker 2: That's right. Well, good morning, council members. Thank you for having me. My name is Dean Priors. I'm currently a principal at Smart Architects where I've been there for 21 years. And our focus is design of affordable housing as well as preservation and adaptive reuse of existing structures.\nSpeaker 2: My background, I have an undergraduate degree in archeology and my graduate degree from the University of Washington with a minor and historic preservation. So this is definitely a passion project for me as well. I recently served a six year term on the Pioneer Square Preservation Board, where I served as vice chair and chair, and I was looking\nSpeaker 2: for kind of a next opportunity to use my skills and interest in applying it to the community. And, you know, I've just been really amazed at the capacity that buildings and places have to be repositories of a community's history and culture and traditions and how they can really serve to activate communities and, you know, just, you know\nSpeaker 2: , spark revitalization and interest among. Among the groups of people and to. Chair McDermott's comment about looking at a variety of different landmarks. I think it is true that, you know, historically landmarks have been kind of viewed through a lens of kind of western your Eurocentric perspective, particularly with regard to the architecture itself and kind of looking more\nSpeaker 2: at a high architecture style as well as a that's more Western focused. And I know that for culture and the Landmarks Commission and other organizations are are currently very active in exploring how other communities, interests and and landmarks can be viewed as well.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm excited to to begin.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Questions and Mr. Killian's. Thank you. I ask Mr. also, Brooke. Do not offer an introduction and speak to your involvement and interest. You get good points on your background.\nSpeaker 2: And those of you who have had an opportunity to read some of my credentials are aware of my experience, my very, very deep experience that I've had with the King County Courthouse, which was launched in two phases during the first several decades of the 20th century.\nSpeaker 2: But I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Adam also. I'm a registered architect and also architectural historian, and I'm currently working at Willamette Cultural Resources Associates, which is a cultural resource management firm that has offices in Portland and Seattle.\nSpeaker 0: Adam, if I can interrupt, can you maybe move your microphone a little closer to your scratch in little thing? We can hear you, but we can.\nSpeaker 2: Can you hear me better now? Yeah. Okay. No, I think that I think there was some noise in the background. I apologize for that. Can you can you hear me better now? Yes, very good. Okay. Thank you. My name is Adam, also Brook.\nSpeaker 2: I'm a registered architect and architectural historian, and I'm currently employed by Willamette Cultural Resources Associates, which is a archeology and architectural history cultural resource management firm with offices in both Seattle and Portland, Oregon. And I am a relatively recent transplant to the Puget Sound region.\nSpeaker 2: I moved to Seattle in November of 2014 from Texas, and I'm a graduate, 24 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin. And I after my graduation, I work, you know, very traditional architecture firms, you know, designing houses.\nSpeaker 2: And then I ended up I ended up working for the Texas Street Design Office, which is a part of the Texas Historical Commission, which is the Texas state and actually the state Historic Preservation Office. The Historic Preservation Office for the state of Texas.\nSpeaker 2: And I work in the Main Street Design Office for just over a year, and then I transferred to another division within the Texas Historical Commission, where I reviewed federal projects under Section one or six of the National Historic Preservation Act and also rehabilitation tax credit projects, and also administered a state preservation grant program, and then also applied\nSpeaker 2: at Texas State Historic Preservation Regulations, which there are several different varieties. So after working for the Texas Historical Commission, I decided to I wanted to work at the city level and ultimately ended up in Seattle after my. Got a job up here.\nSpeaker 2: And so I. I followed. But I my first experience with. King County. And Mark's commission was when I was working on the Logical System Replacement Project at the King County Courthouse, where I was employed with part bonds architects, part design group, and a commission was extremely helpful in reviewing the proposed.\nSpeaker 2: Changes, too. In this case, it was a historic fabric in a hallway to make way for that much needed infrastructure replacement project. And so I also have previously served on the Pioneer Square Preservation Board with the you know, so Dean and I know each other from from there.\nSpeaker 2: We reviewed a lot of already projects after a while while on that board together. And I look forward to bringing my expertize to the.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. also, Brooke, I think you froze. Oh. There we go. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Questions for Mr. Also Brook.

This six month extension will allow time for the departments to complete the work on permanent regulations so that we don't rush to make conclusions and final regulations that we take the time necessary to make\nSpeaker 2: sure we get it right. As you may recall, the Bring Business Home legislation made it easier to operate a home based business during the pandemic by easing some of the restrictions on home based businesses, including the removing the limit of two nonresident employees of the business, removing the restriction that customers can only visit by appointment, and ending\nSpeaker 2: the requirement that businesses retain the appearance of a home and allowing for a slightly larger sign at home based businesses, while also closing the loophole that you could have many as many small signs as you wanted. During the past year, we've not I have not personally received complaints about home based businesses due to the changes in this\nSpeaker 2: Bring Business Home Bill.

I am a skater.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. I I'd like to move to adopt resolution 31868.\nSpeaker 4: Second.\nSpeaker 3: Moved in second. Would you like to speak to it?\nSpeaker 9: Yes. Before I do, Mr. President, I'd like to actually amend Resolution 31868 by substituting version nine for version four B, which has been handed out.\nSpeaker 3: And the move to amend it as described by council members. Get any questions just on the amendment? All those in favor of the amendment, please vote. I oppose vote no. Okay. The resolution has been amended.\nSpeaker 9: Mr. President, I just want to double check with the clerk. Do I need to say for a. Because I said Formby.\nSpeaker 8: So you were substituting for virgin.\nSpeaker 3: Virgin here.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. I think we did that correctly. Let me get back on my script here. I'd also like to request the council rules be suspended to allow consideration of an additional amendment to this resolution. The amendment has been distributed, but was sent after noon deadline.\nSpeaker 9: So this is a formality.\nSpeaker 3: So just one moment here. So. You know, punch drunk this time of the day. So. So should we suspend the rules? Okay, let's suspend the rules. Have no objection to have some explanation of what we're trying to do here with this resolution.\nSpeaker 3: And. That. I'm sorry. So just for the viewing public, the the some of the language would did not meet our 12:00 deadline. And we are suspending that rule if there's no objection to allow for the consideration of that language.\nSpeaker 3: That did not meet our 12:00 deadline. And so councilmember skater, perhaps you could talk about what we're trying to do with this amendment.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. As you will see in Amendment one that's been handed out, there are literally nine additional words that we're adding. We're just including the words the city of Seattle in front of employees. And we're including language that says with other relevant information, such as.\nSpeaker 9: And this is just clarifying language, a small technical change that was helpful for the readers perspective. And we thought that it was a helpful amendment from the team providing feedback.\nSpeaker 3: Very good.\nSpeaker 9: Do you want me to speak to the underlying bill?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Why don't you speak to. It's. It's actually. Okay. So let's adopt the amendment first.\nSpeaker 0: Let's do that.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, let's adopt the amendments so that the amendment has been described. All those in favor of adopting the amendment. Please vote.\nSpeaker 2: I, i.\nSpeaker 3: Those opposed vote no. Okay. The amendment is adopted. Go ahead, Councilwoman Mosquito.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. As we discussed over the last two weeks, there's been a number of individuals that we've heard from that have come forward and really have brought up some legitimate concerns, questions, and asked us to consider the process that we're using at the city council level for considering potential nominations, thanks to council members who want\nSpeaker 9: for hosting a number of meetings where individuals have the chance to come forward and raise questions about process. It really underscored for a number of us on council the desire to make sure that moving forward there was a clear and robust understanding of what the council's expectations are when it comes to new nominees for leading our incredible\nSpeaker 9: departments. I want to reiterate what I've said over the last few weeks, that this is not a substitute or does not specifically pertain to the conversation regarding each of HST or Human Services Department. In fact, it is about a larger conversation, a desire to make sure that we have a clear and transparent process, that we clearly set\nSpeaker 9: out our understanding of what Council will consider and would desires to consider in evaluating nominees from the Executive for future department heads. The resolution in front of you formalizes a process and formalizes conversations that many council members in the executive expects when putting forward nominations.\nSpeaker 9: And it also concretize some of the desires that we've heard from Silence Breakers, from members of the labor unions who've been involved in conversations about how they want to have a seat at the table for new director discussions and includes ideas and feedback that we heard from members of the change team and other employees.\nSpeaker 9: As we evolve and our country evolves, we begin to understand best practices a little bit better. Traditionally, as we all know, having worked on the front line, managers are hired and they're put into place and employees are expected to serve those managers.\nSpeaker 9: But today, I think we're leading by example. We're showing that our best practice should include all parties at the table. It should include making sure that the manager and the selection process is inclusive of individuals who have a direct impact on the lives of individuals they serve and who they work with.\nSpeaker 9: The selection, confirmation and reconfirmation process that's outlined in this resolution affords the City Council and the public an opportunity to hear directly from the executive and the mayors in the future. Goals and visions for department heads as well as the desired qualifications, experiences, accomplishment, leadership concerns or other qualities that the department head needs to sort of outline\nSpeaker 9: for us, or that process should outline for us as the Council considers these nominations. The resolution before us helps Council better understand the process that the mayor will use and the engagement sessions that will be held. And really specifically asked whether the racial equity toolkit and racial equity analysis was used and who had a seat at the\nSpeaker 9: table. I'm really excited that this has been drafted together. Again, I, you know, understand that our conversations are separate, but I think that the conversation that we have had in the past few months has really underscored the desire for a more transparent, inclusive and actually just a greater understanding of the background and the inclusion of folks at\nSpeaker 9: the table. So I'm excited that you see in front of you a few changes that came directly from council members and our community. If I may, Mr. President, I just want to read through for small changes.\nSpeaker 3: Please do council members get.\nSpeaker 9: In section one? A You will see. The amendment clarifies that this resolution outlines the council's expectations and sets forth a more collaborative process from the onset. Thank you, Council Member Herbold, for your work on that Section two a highlights that we are desiring an assessment of the nominee's commitment to racial equity, as we all continue to underscore\nSpeaker 9: that the racial equity toolkit and our commitment to that is more than just words on a piece of paper. We want this to be a living document that we continue to see reiterated in every decision that the Council makes in Section three, and we add in a review of employee complaints resolved in the employee's favor.\nSpeaker 9: This is something that we really wanted to see highlighted from the Silence Breakers themselves, who said that we'd love to see if there was any concerns in the past, but also we wanted to include if any corrective action has been taken and the nominee has participated in various trainings.\nSpeaker 9: That would also be important. As we know, correction and corrective behavior is critical as well. In section five, we include sorry, excuse me. In Section five, we exclude the appointments and confirmations from a handful of departments. For example, Seattle Police Department, noting that we already have some processes and procedures in place that are outlined in statute, and\nSpeaker 9: we have a certain procedure around those appointments that this resolution. Should not supersede. Thank you, Councilmember Gonzales, for raising that. So as you can tell, this resolution has been incredibly collaboratively drafted and right up to the last minute by including additional amendments.\nSpeaker 9: Thanks to all of you for your diligent work to get us amendments early. I know that we tried to include as many as possible. I want to thank Amelia for your work in helping to make sure that we had this on time.\nSpeaker 9: And Jeff Sims and my staff say for their work to get all the amendments in place are looking forward to concurrence on this.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you. Senator Mosquito. Any other.\nSpeaker 2: Quick.\nSpeaker 3: To your point, Councilmember Bagshaw.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And Councilman Mosquito, thank you for listening to everybody on this. I know you've picked up many of our recommendations and also work closely with the mayor's office. And I also acknowledged to the mayor that she wants to be able to do her work under the charter.\nSpeaker 4: We do our work. We got a lot to do here. But you set the tone saying what it is we're looking for. And I want to acknowledge that you have not at any point been in a position where you're telling the mayor what to do, but you're indicating that this is what we're looking at.\nSpeaker 4: We want to make sure that as somebody is selected, that we have an opportunity to get this information in advance. And your focus on racial equity is terrific. So thank you for all your work.\nSpeaker 3: Very good. Any other comments before we take take the boat customers to watch.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, President Harrell. I support this resolution which states expectations for an inclusive candidate surge for City of Seattle department directors in the future. It is obviously a response, as Councilmember Skinner said, to the shameful disregard the mayor showed Human Services employees and impacted communities, including vulnerable homeless community members themselves.\nSpeaker 6: When she nominated Jason Johnson to be the permanent director of the Human Services Department and then continued to systematically ignore the overwhelming voices that we were hearing. As a as has been acknowledged as resolution. This resolution is not about the current issue of the Human Services Director appointment and will do nothing to address that issue.\nSpeaker 6: And that's why it is important to point out that while this resolution is correct in many respects, it's about next time. And it does not provide an excuse for elected officials failing to represent their constituents this time. In the case of the current Human Services Director appointment, which has been quite controversial, this resolution makes many requests that\nSpeaker 6: I fully agree with about how the mayor should make appointments in the future. But I the question that comes to mind is, does the mayor really need the council to recommend she talk to impacted communities before choosing an important department head?\nSpeaker 6: And that just seems obtuse on her part. If that is indeed the case, and what will council members do in the future if the mayor does not take into account the opinions of the impact communities? Because at this moment the opinion, the views of the impacted communities are not being taken into account.\nSpeaker 6: So by passing this resolution, will council members do it in the future? And if they were going to do it in the future, then why don't they do it now? I mean, I have this entire logical conundrum in my brain that if council members are going to vote for this resolution for the future, then why wouldn't they\nSpeaker 6: do it at this moment? You know, I really think that this the community members should watch for this hypocrisy from council members who would all vote yes on this resolution about the future. And at the same time, prove that they have no interest in actually following it because they are disregarding all of its principles when it becomes\nSpeaker 6: a concrete question, such as the Human Services Director appointment, and I should congratulate Council O'Brian and Mosquito for voting with me on the resolution that I brought forward, which said that the mayor should take this nomination back, which has been opposed by a significant proportion of the community and should really go through a search that will include\nSpeaker 6: race and social justice questions and include the impacted communities. So vote yes on this resolution. But ordinary people and city of Seattle employees who are watching this and who will be watching this later this week will have to speak up as courageously as the Human Services workers have spoken up in order to make sure that these resolutions\nSpeaker 6: are not simply in the abstract world, but are followed through by elected officials.\nSpeaker 3: Any of the comments on the resolution before we take a vote. Okay. So those in favor of adopting resolution 31868 as amended, please vote i. I those opposed vote no. The resolutions adopted in Charles Simon. Please read the next agenda item.\nSpeaker 8: For adoption of other resolutions. Agenda Item 13 Resolution 318 71 endorsing the final report and recommendations of the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember Johnson.\nSpeaker 5: Final one, colleagues. This resolution endorses about 18 months with the work that I was your designee for. The Regional Affordable Housing Task Force has some incredible statistics and incredible opportunities in there for us to contemplate room for improvement.\nSpeaker 5: But given that we're now on our three, I won't belabor you with those statistics and just ask you to take a read through. I will say it does set an ambitious goal of building 244,000 net new units of affordable housing by 2040, with the requisite share goal of 8800 units a year over the next five years.\nSpeaker 5: In order to meet our fair share of that goal, I believe that our action earlier today with mandatory housing affordability is one of the critical ways that we would continue to meet our fair share of that 8800 units per year goal.\nSpeaker 5: Similar resolutions are going to be adopted by the County and Sound Cities Association. What started as a sort of small but small idea to implement affordable housing targets in our comprehensive plans morphed into something bigger, bolder and better.\nSpeaker 5: So I encourage your support for Resolution 31871.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Catherine. Just and any comments or questions that I'll move this Catherine Mosquito.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. I'm really proud to co-sponsor this with Councilmember Johnson. This resolution looks forward to future collaboration with our regional partners. We know that it's timely as well, given our conversations today on MHC. We applaud the incredible work it took to get to this point.\nSpeaker 9: But the boundaries of the city do not define the housing crisis in this region. And as we look for additional solutions and hopefully additional revenue as well as well, I'm looking forward to outlining what our local partners can do through the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force recommendations to make sure that other cities around this region pursue policy\nSpeaker 9: changes that achieve greater impacts by doing so in harmony with the city of Seattle. We are taking some important steps today, but in order for us to truly address this regional housing crisis, we needed a collab. We need a collaborative approach, collaborative approach to work on the solutions that can create the housing, the density and the affordability\nSpeaker 9: to truly create an inclusive region. Obviously, this is relying on not just funding from the state and federal partners, which at the federal level will most likely continue to not materialize. But we also need to look at smart land use, zoning and housing policies as were outlined in our legislative agenda to ensure local cities are working towards\nSpeaker 9: the same solution. So excited to co-sponsor this and look forward to future collaboration in our region.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilmember Macheda, any other comments before we take a vote? Really good. Okay. I'll have to move this. I move to adopt resolution 318716 of the resolution be adopted. Those in favor of adopting the resolution please vote.\nSpeaker 3: I oppose vote no. The motion carries and the resolution is adopted. The chair will sign it. Is there any further business to come before the Council? Councilmember Bagshaw.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I'd like to be excused on April 1st.\nSpeaker 3: Second is being moved and second that Councilmember Beck shall be excused on April 1st. Any comments? All those in favor say I opposed the ayes have it because our Sawant.\nSpeaker 6: I also move to be excused on April 1st.\nSpeaker 3: So it's been moved in segment Councilmember Swan be excused on April 1st. Any questions? All those in favor say I, I, all those opposed. No. Councilmember Swan is excused. She didn't answer. I would like to say before we adjourn, i want to thank councilmember suarez for your services.\nSpeaker 3: Pro-Tem president. We deeply appreciate it. And I heard you heard you were outstanding. So. Okay, it's been a long day. Everyone have a great rest of the afternoon and we stand adjourned.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: So watch. Thank you, Mr. Gideon. Thank you. For those people that had been asking, that's the answer. Check to see. You know, thank you. That was a crime experience. But two years ago. Two and a half years ago.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: All right, Madam Clark, we're going to skip to item number 14. Could you please read on 14, please?\nSpeaker 2: Communication from Council Member Pearce recommendation to request the city manager to have the LGBTQ Pride Flag fly every day at City Hall to show support until the LGBTQ community has equal rights nationwide.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. So we have a motion council member. Is there a second to this? Councilmember Pearce, you want to speak to your motion?\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I want to say I was really honored to put this item as my first item. Long Beach quickly became my home. Once I found a community at the LGBTQ center and I was, you know, raised by somebody that was part of the LGBT community in Texas.\nSpeaker 5: And so I know firsthand the struggles that people in our LGBT community face every day outside of of Long Beach and Long Beach, we've come a really long way in the rights of LGBT community, but we still have a long way to go.\nSpeaker 5: We have people in our community that are continually facing struggle turned away from establishments based on their sexual identity. We have people that are still struggling to find public accommodations, making sure that we have public education, where LGBT community would be protected from discrimination, and also making sure that our LGBT community has opportunities around federal funding for\nSpeaker 5: education and health care. And so here in Long Beach, we all stood outside City Hall, a group of us a little over a year ago to celebrate marriage equality. And what we said was that marriage equality was a great first step, but we still have a long way to go that we wanted to fight for equity.\nSpeaker 5: And so I propose raising the flag to celebrate our LGBT community here, but also at a national level. And I want to make two amendments because I know that there's been some discussion about why the LGBT community. So first, I would like to make an amendment to the item that we asked for a report back from city\nSpeaker 5: staff to include a report back on all of our flags. How many flagpoles do we have? What flags have been flown? What flags have been taken down? And what's the process for moving forward to raise one of these flags?\nSpeaker 5: I also want to make sure we include how many flagpoles do we plan to have at the Civic Center at our new civic center? My Second Amendment to this item is that we raise the flag starting as soon as we can, and that we keep it up until either this group decides that there's another process for how\nSpeaker 5: we raise flags or until the Equal Rights Amendment is passed at the federal level. So it's not a forever situation. It is a until we have rights at the federal level. But I'm open to some discussion about that.\nSpeaker 5: I know that there was some discussion about an interfaith flag, veteran's flag. And so I definitely want to make sure that we have an open discussion about how our city celebrates our diversity, but how we also whenever there is an opportunity to say people in the LGBT community in Long Beach should walk around feeling proud, and we\nSpeaker 5: should also have a symbol to say that we respect those rights and that while we are divided, sometimes the city as a whole values equality and equity. So thank you. I ask for your vote tonight.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Councilmember Pearce. Councilmember Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 7: Yes, thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I think this was a, you know, brought up a lot of good discussion. I, too, am a strong advocate for the LGBTQ community, like many of us here on the dais. I know Councilmember Pearce, his story and it's definitely something I know she she certainly believes in and I think many of us\nSpeaker 7: do here in the city of Long Beach. I would also like to see the process unfold to see exactly what we can do. You know, going forward with the new civic center, how many flagpoles we will have. There has been discussions.\nSpeaker 7: Maybe we raise the flag. I believe we have. The Purple Heart flag is one of them during November Veterans Month. And so there's a lot of discussions that have arise from this. I think although this was intended for one thing to begin with, it's really opened it up to a lot of other beautiful discussions for many other\nSpeaker 7: demographics. So I'm looking forward to hearing that first before we move forward. So thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Price.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I want to echo the comments of Councilwoman Gonzales with, with one exception and rather than many of us behind the dais, support the LGBTQ community. I'd I'd say without a doubt, all of us on this council support the LGBTQ community, and we have done so not just in our actions and our words, but in both\nSpeaker 3: and everything that we do. So I don't think that I'm glad that we're asking for a study because for me, while I'm very supportive of the LGBTQ community and the pursuit for equal rights, I want to make sure that all residents feel represented and that we as a city are not giving special attention to one group or\nSpeaker 3: another. I would hate to be in a position where we're denying a request to fly a flag from an organization like the Veterans, for example, because that's one of the issues that we've gotten calls about over the last few days, is what about our organization?\nSpeaker 3: We'd like a flag to and every single person who and not just organizations, but that's probably a bad word. Like the veterans aren't an organization, but they represent.\nSpeaker 2: A group.\nSpeaker 3: Of people who live in our community who deserve to be recognized and protected. And it's to me, it's about inclusion. So I don't want to be in a position where we're not able to. I accept the requests that people make, and I do like the idea of looking at what the flagpole make up is going to be\nSpeaker 3: for the new civic center, because it may be that we have, you know, the the flags that are inclusive of all of us, the American flag, the state flag, the city flag. And then maybe we have another poll or a couple of polls where we can highlight additional causes, groups, individuals, anything that women's rights, you know, domestic\nSpeaker 3: violence, anything that we want to highlight, we can do so with some additional flags that are out there that give us an opportunity to say yes to everybody. That's important to me, to be able to include everybody and not have anyone feel that they're not involved as as residents and that they're not valued as much as others\nSpeaker 3: . So with that, I do want to thank Councilwoman Pearce for bringing this forward. I think it's going to spur a really good discussion and actually probably prompt us to look at something that we hadn't looked at for the nearest civic center.\nSpeaker 3: I don't think we've even talked about that. So it's actually a great discussion for us to start having. So thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Councilmember Price. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. And I don't disagree with anything that any of my colleagues have mentioned thus far. This is a this is Long Beach and we know that here the city government certainly supports our LGBT CU community. I personally have worked to help elect the first gay male here.\nSpeaker 10: Dan Baker had the opportunity to work with Jerry Ships Key, the first lesbian, openly lesbian, a member of the city council and obviously our mayor this is this is a the LGBTQ community has a rich fabric in our community and deserves to be honored.\nSpeaker 10: And I think we do so quite frequently with the new Harvey Milk Park. We have a great gay pride parade in celebration and a month that we dedicate to that. I'm the I have one question because I know we have a number of flags flying right now.\nSpeaker 10: And there's two parts of her motion. The original motion was to do a study, which I certainly support. The other part is to to fly the flag until. So what comes down? In the interim. Is there a blank open flagpole now?\nSpeaker 5: It's my understanding that the last time we flew the pride flag is that it flew underneath our state flag. Or is that correct? State flag that it would be two on one pole. Yes. This is exciting stuff, guys.\nSpeaker 5: Exciting stuff.\nSpeaker 1: Wow.\nSpeaker 5: Sorry about that.\nSpeaker 1: There's. If we choose to fly.\nSpeaker 9: Below the state flag, that there's certainly room for that immediately.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Councilman Austin. And I'll just I can't really queue up, so I'll just make my comments now. I would say thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce, for for bringing this forward. And congratulations on your first city council item.\nSpeaker 8: I'll say that. And I would say that, you know, sometimes sometimes it is good to, you know, go ahead, allow staff to, you know, put it all together, look at it and come with a recommendation that, you know, the whole city council can support.\nSpeaker 8: I'm certainly going to support the proposal and what I heard and I want to make sure that this is in your motion. What I heard was you want them to take a look at the gate, the pride flag.\nSpeaker 8: You want them to look at the, you know, Purple Heart, Gold Star mothers. You know, those groups, the Gold Star Mothers had a flag and it came down to the process of the move as well as the interfaith flag.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, those are the three you want to make sure are included in this study.\nSpeaker 5: I want to make sure that we include those and any others that might be down in the past. Certainly certain and correct me if I'm wrong, the flag come down.\nSpeaker 1: It's still there.\nSpeaker 2: All right.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Okay, councilman. Subpoena.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I guess I would like further clarification. I thought Councilman Austin's point, I wasn't sure where you're going, but I guess I would make a friendly amendment in that if we're going to do a study, let's study it and not take any action right now.\nSpeaker 6: So how would you like to frame that in terms of that? Would that be a friendly amendment.\nSpeaker 8: A city, a city attorney? Could you just restate what you understand is the motion? My understanding is that, yeah, I think there's a little confusion here, but the my understanding is that staff is going to look at all the flags together.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. My my understanding of the motion from the second District was that she had requested a report back to the city council on on the flags, the number of poles, what's flying on them, how how you determine a flag is placed on the pole and what is the procedure to do that?\nSpeaker 9: And then the second part of that motion was to fly the flag, the LGBTQ flag, until that study comes back. Way I understood.\nSpeaker 1: It.\nSpeaker 6: And that's what I heard also. I think we have a cart and a horse syndrome here. If we're going to do the study, let's do the study and find out how we proceed. So that would be my I want to call it a friend of the amendment this time.\nSpeaker 6: So. So looking for a second on that.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you so much. Well, there is no it will.\nSpeaker 9: Be a subsequent motion.\nSpeaker 8: Friendly, friendly amendment. So if it's not Councilmember Pearce, so you have a friendly to combine the study with the pride flag. Are you open to that?\nSpeaker 5: Let me think. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. And I would just ask, what is your timing? Your timing considerations?\nSpeaker 5: You get that back in the next 30 days to shorten.\nSpeaker 1: We will certainly tell you.\nSpeaker 9: Where we are in 30 days, but we'll try to come back in 30 days.\nSpeaker 8: Just a recommendation, I would say. Try to bring it back after the budget. Give them a good 60 days so they actually have a report.\nSpeaker 5: Sure. If you could bring it back right after the budget, which is September 15th, that.\nSpeaker 9: Will come as fast as we can and give you updates. No worries.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Councilmember Price.\nSpeaker 3: Just one quick question. Do we have a flag policy? And if not, can we look at creating one so that in the future, if a group comes and says, we'd like our flag flown, we can have a policy that's kind of consistent and not arbitrary.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Pierson Members of the City Council. Price Scuse me. And Member City Council, we do have a flag policy.\nSpeaker 9: It's actually a.\nSpeaker 1: City manager administrative regulation that does spell out and we do have information on the flags. But one of the provisions.\nSpeaker 9: Of that policy is if any other flag wants to be added, then it's.\nSpeaker 1: There's a discussion at the city council that happens. So we're appropriately following that process.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 10: And as a follow up to that policy, is there in that policy, is there direction on on taking the flag or removing the flag from our poll? Because I have my staff research all of the flags and there's at least one of them that gives me some some concern.\nSpeaker 1: Not having committed it to memory. I don't recall exactly about removing, but I don't believe it really talked about removing it talks.\nSpeaker 9: About the federal flag and how that should be flown because there are some protocols on the federal flag. It talks about the city and the other flags.\nSpeaker 1: We have a list of some others that have been added over the years. There are several flags that are flown every day.\nSpeaker 9: But we can certainly revisit the policy that's currently there.\nSpeaker 1: We'll talk about that in the report and then we can certainly look at how to remove flags. And again, I think all of that really does happen at the city council level.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. There it is. Thank you. So seeing no more council comic will open it up to public comment.\nSpeaker 1: Very good. You click as the address. I would suggest to the council person from the Second District that our energies should be focused 100% and trying to forestall. The bankruptcy that is facing this state, this city, instead of going off on a harebrained idea like this.\nSpeaker 1: We fly the American flag, the state flag, the city flag and the flag. And I don't know if the official policy is relative to the gold star that is connected with veterans. Military affairs. Buried. Any other flag can certainly be flown, but not here.\nSpeaker 1: At the city hall. What I've long suggested is we create and this and this is particularly true given well. Let me go back. I've suggested a couple of years ago. Three years ago. What we develop is that in our largest city park, Eldorado Park, we set aside a place where we call pandering park.\nSpeaker 1: And on the longest weekend of the year in the summer, starting at Friday till Monday, any group, whatever they are. Good, bad, whatever, good looking, bad looking, whatever group left, right. They can march over Hill, over Dale, over here, there and anywhere they want and get it out of their system period.\nSpeaker 1: And that is particularly true when we're talking about the. Gay flag and the Harvey Milk debacle, which was engendered by despicable conduct of a mayor that capitalized on the tragic death of two individuals. Neither of whom had any connection to whatsoever.\nSpeaker 1: But he thought he could make some political hay out of that. That. Will be eventually removed also over to and we can put it in pandering park. But the policies should be these three flags that are flying their.\nSpeaker 1: In addition to the other flag that was referenced dealing with veterans. Period. Otherwise, what we've got is every Tom, Dick and Harry with every group from Mickey Mouse. To the Boy Scouts. To the Klu Klux Klan. What about the group that was in here?\nSpeaker 1: Parties complaining about the massacres in their country? We start doing that. Stick with those three flags.\nSpeaker 8: And thank you, Mr. Goodhue. Thank you. Next.\nSpeaker 1: He's.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening again, Diana Le Gene. First of all, I do want to commend Councilwoman Pierce for her empathy and to her feelings about this particular issue. My my concern is, is that if you're going to represent one group, then you need to represent all.\nSpeaker 2: So one thing that could be considered is like the U.N. the U.N. has flags from all the different nations. So you could have in the courtroom in the area outside city hall, you could have a number of different flags and you could have a number of different groups represented.\nSpeaker 2: However, you're going to have to really use your judgment on which ones because you might want to have the veterans flags or what about Black Lives Matter? Or What about the Hispanics? Or. So, you know, you're going to be very careful to be inclusive.\nSpeaker 2: One of the things that concern me are that you're going to have to have a flag with a green cross on it because medical marijuana patients are also very underrepresented. So I'm just and I'm not saying that to be funny.\nSpeaker 2: I you know, they are legally persecuted. So. So I'm just saying, you might want to be very careful with them. And I do understand wanting to support people who are not being honored. And in that respect, what I have personally done is I will not stand up from this day forward.\nSpeaker 2: In fact, I started a couple of weeks ago to stand up for the Pledge of Allegiance because it ends with and liberty and justice for all. And that is just not true in this country. It is just not true.\nSpeaker 2: And until that happens and I don't care what it I don't care whether you're black, white, purple, green, medical marijuana patient or you're Hispanic. It doesn't matter to me. It should be liberty and justice for all. And so if you really want to object to that, then my suggestion is you do not stand for I love the\nSpeaker 2: country. I just do not appreciate the the the empty words of liberty and justice for all. So I'm just suggesting that if you want to truly object to it, sit down. Don't. You know, that's a great way of quietly objecting to the injustice in this country.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: My name is excuse me. My name is Lynn Roba. I've been a resident here for 36 years. I suggest that the lady before me might want to visit some other countries where there is no liberty and justice for all before she stops saluting our beautiful flag.\nSpeaker 2: When I found out about this item agenda, my first reaction was, I don't remember getting to vote on this. And so I decided to come down here and give my opinion. I've always bragged about Long Beach as being so racially diverse, and we have a lot of people that we know from other countries that we show around\nSpeaker 2: here, and we're so proud of Long Beach and its diversity. It's also diverse and backgrounds and cultures and religions and persuasions. I think it's a mistake to lift up one particular persuasion above another and to honor that persuasion with flying just their flag below these three flags.\nSpeaker 2: I think it's a mistake. We all have persuasions and we all are waiting to see our goals be realized. How many flags will there need to be to represent all of us in Long Beach? I recommend that we not approve this recommendation.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Next.\nSpeaker 6: Hello. I'm David Pope Grover, and I'm the pastor of Hope Chapel in Long Beach, and I'm a resident here the same time as my wife, Lynn, who just spoke. And I would like to say something about the American flag tonight.\nSpeaker 6: We saluted it.\nSpeaker 1: Together and we were in unity.\nSpeaker 6: And there's so much diversity here. But when we we see our flag, the the the red, white and blue. And we see ourselves as a nation under God. We're in.\nSpeaker 1: Unity.\nSpeaker 6: And this this flag protects all peoples. There. There should be liberty and justice and freedom for all. But I don't feel that it's a righteous act. To endorse what the Bible says is a sin. And we need to get to the root of the matter.\nSpeaker 6: We need to get back to the Bible and back to the Word of God. And so I'm here at Happy. To call you to repentance. And to come back to the truth because it's only the truth will truly set us free and make us find peace among ourselves.\nSpeaker 6: God bless you. I hope you'll consider that.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Next.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Daniel Cartagena. I live in the first district. I'm a veteran from the Korean War. I was in the first Marine Division from 1951 to 52 and Korea. And I was at the VA hospital yesterday when this discussion started about the flag.\nSpeaker 1: At first, you know, I was upset. Because to me, the American flag means a hell of a lot. I know many of you weren't even born towards the end of World War Two, but at the Battle of Iwo Jima.\nSpeaker 1: There were five Marines and one Navy corpsman that raised the flag on Mount Suribachi. And to me, that represented the strength of our country. I'm a very proud man to live in the United States. I did my service time.\nSpeaker 1: And so when this item came up, I wasn't too sure how hard to digest it. At first I was upset. But then I decided I wanted to come down here to. To find out more about it. And I don't have a problem talking about maybe a policy for flags.\nSpeaker 1: But I think I like to everybody to know that, you know, the American flag means a hell of a lot to a lot of us veterans. And I think that veterans should be included if there's going to be any input on any of this discussion.\nSpeaker 1: And I can I know several guys that would be more than happy to come down and discuss this whole issue. So that's my response. Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Next.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, Dave is Keith resident in Long Beach. I just want to say on this topic of the flag for the LGBTQ being flown. I feel that it's opening up a can of worms and you're going to get some pushback.\nSpeaker 1: And lastly, there is inclusion, inclusion, inclusion. The study must be done. Because other groups are going to come forward and say, hey, my flag should be able to fly as well. I agree with you, Suzy, and what you said, Jeannie, all of those things that you mentioned about the issues that the L, g, b, t q deal\nSpeaker 1: with, African-Americans are dealing with that. Almost since the beginning of time, and we still don't have equality. So if that is the case, the study must be done because the Black Lives Matter is going to come up and say, Hey, our flag should be flying up there too, because we've been dealing with the issue much longer then\nSpeaker 1: the pride community. That is what's going to happen. And this is a hot topic. As a former reporter for an ABC affiliate station. Trust me. It's going to be some pushback in the community and the news is going to grab on to it and you're going to be seeing a lot of stories going on.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm not saying that I'm against it. I'm not saying I'm for it. I'm kind of neutral right now. But if. The Council decides to move forward. Then you have to open it up for everybody. And on the topic of flying all year long until equality runs, until equality is achieved, rather then if that's the case, then\nSpeaker 1: it needs to be opened up to other groups to. For African-Americans and the Latino, Latinos and everybody else until equality is achieved. So there's a whole lot in there that needs to be considered. A whole lot. So think about it very carefully, because once again, it's going to open up a can of worms.\nSpeaker 1: If we move forward. If we go forward. This is Long Beach. Hey, more power to you, but it has to be open to everybody else. Thank you. And one last thing. I agree with the lady. I think she laugh in regards to the Pledge of Allegiance.\nSpeaker 1: And justice for all. We haven't got there yet because if we have, we wouldn't be having all of this push back and confusion going on in America.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, sir. Next.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. Jim Hutchinson.\nSpeaker 0: Again and.\nSpeaker 1: Again. I just going to echo some of the same sentiments that have been articulated. I have appreciated the ethnic, cultural and demographic diversity of our city, but I am again convinced that we must put the brakes on this resolution for several reasons.\nSpeaker 1: Most of us agree that the American flag is a powerful symbol of unification, patriotism and shared values. However, the rainbow flag does not unify or reflect shared values. It exalts one group above the others, as has been said.\nSpeaker 1: And it's going to divide rather than unify. It sends the wrong message, although many will say that it invites inclusiveness, it's going to do the opposite. Many in our community believe the LGBTQ issues and lifestyles are not healthy on many levels, but we respect the community's right to choose as long as it doesn't promote itself above other\nSpeaker 1: cultures and values, which also have the equal right to expression. This is exactly the message you will send if you vote yes on this resolution. Cultural flags, in my opinion, are just not appropriate for government venues. Also, many of us feel.\nSpeaker 0: Our voices.\nSpeaker 1: On this issue are either not heard or ignored, and that politicians, by attempting to pass these.\nSpeaker 0: Kinds of resolute.\nSpeaker 1: Resolutions, confirm the sentiment and disregarding large segments of the city's citizens who believe traditional and biblically based relationships are the best for physically, emotionally, socially and spiritually. Please vote no on this resolution a proposition which is divisive rather than unifying.\nSpeaker 1: Let us continue to agree to pledge the allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And yes, we do not have liberty and justice for all, but we're pursuing that. So thank you for the time. This time, I pray that you would consider our opinions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Next.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. My name is Porter Dahlberg and I am the executive director for the LGBTQ Center of Long Beach. I am also an LGBTQ person. I am here in strong support of Councilmember Pierce's original agenda item. Last night I was in Las Vegas on vacation with my parents as a treat to my mom.\nSpeaker 2: I took her to see Terry Faders Puppet Show at the Mirage. After three incredibly demeaning jokes about LGBTQ people, including putting a male audience member in a dress and then proclaiming that he could now use any restroom he wanted, I left, holding back hot tears of anger.\nSpeaker 2: I complained to the manager as my mother, who I love deeply and who I know loves me deeply as well, and tries her best to understand who I am. Did not stand beside me, but instead waited down the hallway while I expressed my concern.\nSpeaker 2: The manager told me that he was sorry I didn't enjoy the show and gave me the email address of someone else to contact. A gay man interrupted my complaints to tell the manager that he was gay and wasn't offended at all and that quote unquote, we needed to learn to laugh at ourselves.\nSpeaker 2: I felt the tears of raw vulnerability, threatening exposure, so I did not get to ask him when the last time he was harassed and a restroom was. I knew his answer would have been never. But the memory of the last time this happened to me was quickly surfacing in my mind.\nSpeaker 2: When Caitlyn Jenner accepted her SB award last year, she said, If you want to call me names, make jokes, I can take it. But for the thousands of kids out there coming to terms with being true to who they are, they shouldn't have to take it.\nSpeaker 2: And I was one of those kids last night, childlike, full of insecurity, helplessness and doubt. And in that moment with the manager, I knew that I was all alone and no one was going to believe me or acknowledge my hurt.\nSpeaker 2: I did not feel safe in Las Vegas. Symbolism is important. When LGBTQ people see a rainbow flag flying at our civic center. They know we will believe and acknowledge them when they come to us with their hurt and pain.\nSpeaker 2: They will know that we are a city that cares enough about LGBTQ people and the messages we constantly receive that we are punch lines and punching bags are unacceptable. And they will know that we are a city that values, embraces and acknowledges how much farther LGBTQ people have to go in the world and among ourselves to live\nSpeaker 2: with safety and dignity and without shame. I deeply value the kindness and respect each of you has demonstrated towards the LGBTQ community. Our flag, our symbol of hope, is worthy of official acknowledgment more than once a year. And I strongly encourage you to honor the spirit of the original item and fly the flag for at least 30\nSpeaker 2: days. While this study is conducted, it will go a long way in mending many wounded spirits and broken hearts, including mine. Thank you so.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Our next speaker.\nSpeaker 7: Hi. My name is Dr..\nSpeaker 5: Elaine Villanueva.\nSpeaker 7: Bernal, and they reside in the fourth District and.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 2: Support the study. And just so thank you just to and I.\nSpeaker 7: Want to share with you.\nSpeaker 2: With with this entire audience here that I am also a.\nSpeaker 7: Daughter of a Vietnam vet. My dad serve in Danang for two years from 1965 to 67. But tonight I am here to speak about the LGBTQ community.\nSpeaker 2: So I'm going to speak from a professional and professional.\nSpeaker 5: Professional and personal standpoint.\nSpeaker 3: And for.\nSpeaker 5: Those of you that know me, I teach chemistry, and I also teach with.\nSpeaker 2: Science education at Cal State Long Beach, and I'm faculty there for ten years.\nSpeaker 5: And while there has been great strides in.\nSpeaker 2: Promoting women, especially women of color like myself in STEM.\nSpeaker 7: We have a long way to go with the LGBTQ community. In my.\nSpeaker 5: Profession.\nSpeaker 7: From my experience being 15.\nSpeaker 2: Ten, 15.\nSpeaker 7: Years in the STEM community.\nSpeaker 5: In the profession, that science is pretty straight, very heteronormative.\nSpeaker 2: There was a recent study, Queer in STEM survey with 14 over 1400 participants, respondents where 40% of queer STEM workers reported that they have not come out to their colleagues and coworkers.\nSpeaker 5: And just to close this out in the last minute and a half, I want.\nSpeaker 2: To share one of my students stories. His name is Victor. He was one of my biochemistry students where when he came out to his parents, his parents kicked him out. And, you know, as far as the studies, it's like a tank.\nSpeaker 2: And on a positive note, fortunately, he returned home.\nSpeaker 5: Where while there's much conversation and healing that had to take.\nSpeaker 7: Place.\nSpeaker 5: He's one of our top student.\nSpeaker 2: Researchers now at Cal State Long Beach. So it's those things that I keep in mind as far as a symbolism that we need to show as a community and for the LGBT community.\nSpeaker 5: I think you.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Next.\nSpeaker 7: My name is Cynthia Newsom.\nSpeaker 2: I've been a.\nSpeaker 7: Resident in Long Beach for over 36 years.\nSpeaker 2: I just kind of want to give a timeline of. Our world. Our world was created by God.\nSpeaker 7: And when he made all the heavens and the earth and all the.\nSpeaker 2: Animals and everything, he made.\nSpeaker 7: Adam. And then he made Eve.\nSpeaker 5: His goal was to be a man.\nSpeaker 7: Woman marriage.\nSpeaker 2: So what has.\nSpeaker 7: Happened? You know, Adam and Eve ate the fruit and.\nSpeaker 2: Sin entered the world.\nSpeaker 5: Okay, so.\nSpeaker 2: So then we come to Sodom and Gomorrah. Well, God's view.\nSpeaker 5: Of homosexuality is.\nSpeaker 7: An abomination.\nSpeaker 5: And what you know, because they didn't repent. They were destroyed. And so we see throughout the whole Bible that. That God condemns it. So then we've we've got America. We've created America.\nSpeaker 2: Most of our founding fathers. Were believed in the Bible.\nSpeaker 5: They wrote all these wonderful.\nSpeaker 2: Things the Declaration of.\nSpeaker 5: Independence, the Bill of Rights, etc.. Okay. So, you know, I would say most of the citizens were God fearing people at the time. Well, our society has changed a lot.\nSpeaker 7: Now as far as marriage is concerned.\nSpeaker 2: If you look at all the states that have.\nSpeaker 5: Voted.\nSpeaker 2: For homosexual marriage, it's not been the people. The people have not voted on it. Here in California, twice we put on the initiative.\nSpeaker 5: To have a marriage between one man and one woman. And it got shot down twice. And so it's not that the people have voted for it. It's that our courts are judges, our legislators. Everyone has catered to. That lifestyle.\nSpeaker 5: And I when I heard that.\nSpeaker 2: All of you council people voted for same sex marriage, I was ashamed. I could not believe it.\nSpeaker 5: Well, yet I couldn't believe it because I know what kind of influence we have here. But. And then we've got the Supreme Court that totally went against God's law.\nSpeaker 2: I will say one thing that, you know, the Supreme Court, they can.\nSpeaker 5: Do.\nSpeaker 7: Whatever they want to.\nSpeaker 2: But marriage was.\nSpeaker 5: Created by God.\nSpeaker 2: And he's the only one that can change it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. New speaker, please.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. My name is James Sweitzer. I live in the third district resident. I actually was not planning to speak tonight. I came to catch up on emails after my four week absence. But I think in light of some of this conversation turning into all Flags Matter conversation, and I think a lot of the other commenters being\nSpeaker 1: the perfect example of why this item needs to be discussed and why we need to. I mean, I'm so proud of all of you for even entertaining. This, I think, speaks volumes to it. And I think that I want to let you all know personally.\nSpeaker 1: I'm trying without crying. What kind of message you're sending? I don't want to do that with the story. Sunday morning on June 12th, I woke up, um, actually very now when we sit back very early morning on June 12th, I was at a bar with some friends and waiting outside after the bar had closed at the entrance\nSpeaker 1: on the street and talking to people and enjoying the space and the freedom that I had there. And to wake up the next morning and find out that the same people who were doing the exact same thing I did were not alive at that same time.\nSpeaker 1: It was terrifying. And I remember I couldn't even consider going on social media. Friends that invited me to come out here and join the amazing community out here at Harvey Milk Park. And I honestly wasn't ready for that.\nSpeaker 1: As somebody who's gone through so much trials and tribulations and contemplating my own suicide at the age of 16 and struggling with my own identity, not only just as a gay man, as a gay man of color. It was terrifying.\nSpeaker 1: And the first time, two weeks after that night, going back to a gay bar and a gay bar because it's a safe space for me to be and be myself and seeing other people and especially people of color and seeing that rainbow flag.\nSpeaker 1: I cried. I cried. And to be able to see that and to know that I can look at the American flag and say, that's beautiful. Because as some of these speakers said, that represents everybody. Everybody, whether we're disabled, able bodied, whether we come from where people of color, whether we whatever, regardless of our income, that represents everybody\nSpeaker 1: . But the message that you all are sending right now by saying whether it's until we have equal rights nationwide or whether it's just for 30 days to see that everybody is beatable. But right now, we need to care for the specific people in the LGBT community because they are hurting.\nSpeaker 1: And I agree with our speaker. If there is a Black Lives Matter flag, let's play that, too, because right now there is a lot of hurt and a lot of hurt right here, not just in our nation, in the world, but in our own community.\nSpeaker 1: And I'm so proud of all of you for entertaining this. And I would just encourage you so much. To you know, I know you're for the study, but to really consider this is a very important item for our community.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you next week for please.\nSpeaker 10: Hi. And it's Tom Stout. Information on file. I'm not really.\nSpeaker 6: In favor of this ordinance. The bottom line, I think the three flags that are displayed there are what should be displayed at public buildings. Now.\nSpeaker 10: You do fly the pride flag. You see it all over Long Beach. It's flown during the Gay Pride Month.\nSpeaker 6: That's fine. But I don't think there.\nSpeaker 10: Are enough flagpoles for every group that wants to fly a flag at any public building. Maybe you should get one of the RDA properties that you're giving away anyway. And let's make it a flag park and you can fly whatever flag you want there with, you know, certain exceptions.\nSpeaker 10: So what do you think? Let's use an RDA proper. You're giving them away anyway. What the hell? All right. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And the other public comment synonym closing public comment. Back to the council. Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 5: First turn on my mic. I want to thank everybody. Literally everybody that came and spoke tonight. I want to be reflective. You know, we heard a lot about other community members that might have been left out of this this flag discussion.\nSpeaker 5: And to be clear, members of our LGBTQ community are members of every part of our community. They're veterans. They are Christians. They they're African-American. They are cover every single part of our community. But there are small minority still that still has been struggling every day.\nSpeaker 5: And I want to thank James Swasey for sharing where you were and how you were feeling when lives were lost. Since 2010, we've had over 150 hate crimes on the LGBT community that made national news. And that's not including what happens in our streets.\nSpeaker 5: That is not reported. And that is, again, one of the reasons why I brought this item up, thinking about the state of our country and the fact that we lost lives in Orlando, 49 lives, 53 wounded. It is a time that I think sometimes we feel that we have made a lot of strides, but we haven't quite\nSpeaker 5: gotten there yet. So I want to thank everybody for the fruitful discussion on the study, which I look forward to staff coming back, and I would like to ask that council members reconsider their friendly amendments. We had some requests from the audience around flying the flag for 30 days or some shorter period of time, preferably 30 days\nSpeaker 5: until that study does come back. Would you be open to that?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So I wasn't here when the friendlies were done. So there's a motion in a second. Who was there? A friendly member. Okay. Council member. Supernova.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. And thank you to the speakers, Elaine James and to Porter. I think Porter introduced the 30 day window and by my friendly amendment I someone used the word divisive and that's all I was trying to avoid.\nSpeaker 6: So we wouldn't have this here tonight. But it was inevitable to go to a study I think is is make sense. I guess what I had question was flying the flag and then tell the point we have a study and then what if the study has the wrong result, then you have to take the flag down.\nSpeaker 6: So I like the concept of having the flag up for a limited time. 30 days is fine and then it comes down and then we go to a study. So that's if, if I could revise my friendly, I guess that's what it would mean.\nSpeaker 5: Q Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So the there's a, from what I understand, correct from wrong because it wasn't here. The friendly amendment is to do a study on the flags that are we currently have as far as inventory of what we fly with possibly looking at what we should be flying is that that right and then 30 days for the pride\nSpeaker 0: flag. Okay. Yeah. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 3: So I really I appreciate the discussion that we're having. I'm a little bit I don't quite understand the 30 days. I mean, the idea of taking the flag down once we hang it to me seems. I don't know.\nSpeaker 3: I think I would have a really hard. If we're going to fly the flag, let's fly the flag. I don't I don't understand the concept of hanging it for 30 days and then taking it down. It's not even, in my opinion, unless I'm missing something.\nSpeaker 3: This 30 day period isn't even. Coinciding with anything else, a message or a reminder? I don't know. I just I feel like putting it if that is what will make people happy, that's fine. I just don't know the wisdom of that.\nSpeaker 3: Wouldn't it be better for us to establish a flag policy, determine what consistent methodology we're going to use to hang flags? And and I really appreciate James's comments. I mean, they they really they they're very touching. And he says, well, you know, if this organization wants it to hang their flag, too, that that's fine.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, I actually really like that philosophy is that I don't think we should be saying no to anybody. I mean, women I'm sure there's women who think we need equality. I'm sure there's people of color who think we need equality.\nSpeaker 3: And they might come in next week and say, you know what, we want our banner or we want some symbol of our fight and our struggle hung up there, too. And then we don't even have any sort of guidelines right now.\nSpeaker 3: We can't even justify what we would say is we're going to hang this flag for 30 days because our colleague brought the item forward and your request alone isn't enough. But if you can get a council person to bring the item forward, then we'll fly your flag for 30 days.\nSpeaker 3: I just I don't want to set that kind of precedent. I respect this honestly. The concern that I had when this came forward is, is how do I express my real concerns without it being misinterpreted? And I know a lot of my colleagues feel the same way.\nSpeaker 3: The concern is that tomorrow, if an organization comes and says, you know what, my husband's a veteran, and when I was talking about this item with him, he said, you guys should hang the you know, do you have something out there for veterans?\nSpeaker 3: And I said, gosh, I don't know. But it was like the slippery slope, like we could we could end up having 20 flags out there. If we are like I, I genuinely appreciate and love the diversity of my community.\nSpeaker 3: I love it. But we cannot be in a place where we're hanging everybody's flag because we just we can't we have to have some sort of limit. We represent everybody. And the most inclusive way to represent everybody is through the flag of the United States of America.\nSpeaker 3: That's how we represent everybody. So I'm not saying I'm not saying let's not hang other flags. I'm just saying let's have, you know, a method by which we decide. And, you know.\nSpeaker 2: If if.\nSpeaker 3: We've hung the flag before on multiple occasions, but they've always coincided to some sort of message. I just I'm missing the message. But again, I want to listen from my colleagues on this. If it's something that people feel strongly that that there's something to that 30 days, I will say I think that.\nSpeaker 2: Our.\nSpeaker 3: Our actions should mean something. In regards to our commitment to this community, I think our actions should mean something. I know that I represent a district that has in the past not been very active at all in these efforts.\nSpeaker 3: And yet for the last two years, I have participated in, supported, done everything that I can to support the community. And I don't want my concerns about allowing one flag because it opens the door for others to be misinterpreted, to mean something that it doesn't.\nSpeaker 3: I think our actions should mean something. We live in a beautiful, diverse city with a gay mayor. Turns out he's gay and he has done a great deal for to educate every single one of us, teach us about everything, include us.\nSpeaker 3: And so much he's been so inclusive in allowing us to be a part of his community. And I respect that and I appreciate that. It's made me a better person. I think we should be, as a city, judged by our actions.\nSpeaker 3: And the other concern that I have is the way that the agenda item was written. I respect it, I appreciate it. I don't think we as a government entity should be hanging flags or banners in some sort to send some sort of a political message for a fight for equality.\nSpeaker 3: Because there are so many organizations and and people that deserve equality. There are so many disenfranchized people in America. We live in a beautiful country. We have a land of opportunity. But we really should be we should be in a position that we say yes to every group that wants that fight for equality.\nSpeaker 3: And if we're going to do that, then it's it's we're opening it's a slippery slope. And that's my concern. So I just I have a concern. Yeah. It might be easier thing tonight would have been for me to say, all right, 30 days, let's do it.\nSpeaker 3: But. What? What is the meaning of the 30 days? I guess that's just what I don't understand. Why? 30 days? Because we were just told the report's not even going to come back for 30 days. So we're going to take the flag down and 30 days with no report.\nSpeaker 3: I don't quite understand that thinking, but if somebody can help me understand that again, I'm I'm I'm more supportive of the community and the message and the fight then, then I can express in my words. And if it takes me voting for a flag to go up for 30 days and come down in 30 days to prove\nSpeaker 3: that, then, then I'll do that. But I would hope that my actions would would mean more than putting up a flag for 30 days.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And so I would I would say that, you know, I was I was I listened. It was my first first time in the hot seat. And I listened. I was, you know, front and center and listened to all of the testimony.\nSpeaker 8: And some stuff did stand out. To me, particularly, James, was those comments when he said, you know, a conversation about a single proposal turned into an all like all all flags matter conversation. And that did resound to me because before rushing to and I'm guilty of as well, I also, you know, I threw in the interfaith flag\nSpeaker 8: and all those things because I was approached with that over the course of the last week. But I think there you know, there is something to say there about when you step forward to say here is one community that has a certain circumstance and we are in the middle of a fight.\nSpeaker 8: Let's talk about this fight. Not all the fights right now. We can study and talk about all the fights that it may actually make sense to me. So if a colleague were to come forth and say, here's an issue that I sincerely care about, I want our council in our city to acknowledge it for a period of\nSpeaker 8: time. I also acknowledge all of these other things, and I'm inclusive of those as well. But I'm asking for a special acknowledgment. Hearing that and putting that perspective. I think the compromise proposal by Porter does make sense. Now, that came from public comment.\nSpeaker 8: Now, the distinction is what I heard. What I heard from from the public comment was, you know, acknowledge the request by flying it over the course of the study. It didn't say 30 days. It said over the course of the study.\nSpeaker 8: And that makes that make sense to me along the lines of, you know, the thinking that Councilmember Price said. So I could I could understand I could actually support that, because it does make sense. We're acknowledging the request, and we are also why we go through the process of evaluating our flag policy, looking at, you know, all\nSpeaker 8: the groups that made these requests because frankly, you know, certain issues, you know, it's very passionate to a lot of people. And we do have a job as a city who cares about tolerance and cares about diversity and values, differences.\nSpeaker 8: We do have a job to look at all of them. So I would just say I'm going to be supportive of the motion. I would hope that it actually just it just aligns with a study to where we fly it until we make a decision as the full council on what our flag policy is.\nSpeaker 8: So that's my hope. And it's not a friendly I'm just throwing it out there. That's where I think where where I think this conversation should go. Thanks.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 7: Again, I'll just reinforce, you know, I think this was a really good, fruitful discussion. I think, you know, as much as we want to, of course, see what the flag study will bring, which is something that we will certainly do.\nSpeaker 7: I think that is very important knowing that we have a new civic center coming up. But I will agree, I think in the interim, there's always going to be there's always going to be a demographic that needs our our support.\nSpeaker 7: And I think that if there's any demographic here in the city, of course, certainly veterans I'm a granddaughter of a World War Two veteran. That doesn't make me any less caring for veterans. We fly the veteran flag. We fly the American flag.\nSpeaker 7: I have the American flag of my grandfather's grave sitting on on my in my mantle at my parents house, care much deeply about that. But I think also there's you know, if if there is a council member that is raising a concern.\nSpeaker 7: You know, we can't address it for that meantime. And so I think it's important that we at least address this. I don't think it's unreasonable to say that we will be flying this as council, as Vice Mayor Rex Richardson said for a short period of time, until we can decide what the flag pole study will bring and\nSpeaker 7: then hopefully bring a policy back that will be very solid. And so we can move forward from there and decide from there what we need to do. And maybe there's more flags that could come of it. Maybe we take some flags out.\nSpeaker 7: I don't know what that discussion will bring, but at least we'll have some sort of information. So I hope people can be a little bit more open minded. And, you know, the disrespect that I've been hearing out there, especially from Larry, you know, it's really it's really bad when you hear that type of disrespect, especially with such\nSpeaker 7: sensitive issues. It's really disrespectful. And I know you come here every every day, every Tuesday. But to hear things in light of, you know, what people have shown is concerns. I would just ask for your respect in that sense.\nSpeaker 7: So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Pearson.\nSpeaker 5: Well, first I have to say, I didn't think my first agenda item would be a flag. We were talking about flagpoles for an hour. So thank you guys for sticking out with us and going through this conversation. I want to just get some clarity because Vice Mayor Richardson, you had made a comment about keeping it up.\nSpeaker 5: Was that a. Because right now we have a friendly amendment for 30 days. Sure.\nSpeaker 8: So you're just point of order. You're in control of the motion. It's your motion to accept it, to recommend the friendly as a recommendation to change it. And I just simply said the recommendation from Porter, what he said was to go ahead and fly the flag through the course of the study that I think I would support\nSpeaker 8: . It's ultimately in your hands there.\nSpeaker 5: What?\nSpeaker 0: Porter actually went second because the city attorney wanted to say something.\nSpeaker 9: Just a slight correction to the vice mayor. The motion now is the motion of the floor. It's been made in a second and it's been amended. And so anybody could make either offer a friendly or a substitute motion.\nSpeaker 9: At this time, it's not controlled by the maker anymore because it's now been accepted. And it's it's a motion of the floor.\nSpeaker 0: And do you want a city attorney? Do you want to read the motion on the floor just so that everyone's clear?\nSpeaker 9: As I understand it, the motion on the floor is to request city manager to conduct a study regarding the flags at the Civic Center and that the flag would fly for a 30 day period.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's the current motion on the floor. Back to Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So that's a commotion on the floor. I'd like to accept that motion. Yes. I ask for your support.\nSpeaker 0: And you mean you're going to. That's the motion that's on the floor that you support, right? Okay, perfect. Hey, everyone. Everyone has a first couple of weeks, so, you know, we got to make sure that we go over this stuff some time, so.\nSpeaker 0: Great. So just so just to be clear, Councilmember Pearce, is that there's a motion on the floor which is to do a study asking management and then to also fly the pride of flight for 30 days.\nSpeaker 5: Councilmember Pearce. Sorry, I want to get clarity how I think that I've heard from a couple of the council members that we don't want to be in the situation where we're taking the flag down. Sorry. We're we're in that process of taking it down with it.\nSpeaker 5: Require a vote. Could we? Is it only 30 days and then it removes that. Okay. It's only 30 days. Are you okay with that? I would prefer to stay up through the course of the study.\nSpeaker 8: That was that.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, let me just.\nSpeaker 0: Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no. Actually, hold on. The only person that has a flaw is cancer fighters.\nSpeaker 5: I would like to go ahead and request that the friendly amendments that we remove the friendly amendments. Yes, that.\nSpeaker 0: So who made this? Who made the friendly amendment?\nSpeaker 9: Council member.\nSpeaker 5: Anon, I remember you guys when you were first new to.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, of course.\nSpeaker 0: That's okay.\nSpeaker 2: Still. Still?\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So the original motion I would like to ask you withdraw the friendly Daryl Mr. Supernova council membership and all that way we don't have to be in a situation where we're taking the flag down.\nSpeaker 9: If the if the friendly is removed and the motion is to conduct a study in the flag would not be flown at this time.\nSpeaker 5: That's not what my original.\nSpeaker 9: Original motion said, that you wanted to fly it until there was, I believe, sorry, recognition at the federal level.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Actually, guys from the audience, please be respectful.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. What I would like is the study to be done, and I would like for us to raise the flag until the study is complete.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So there's a motion. There was a second on that motion, I'm assuming from my thing was Councilwoman Gonzalez, is that right? Okay. Is is. Is that fine, Dulles? Okay. So the motion is to go forward with the study.\nSpeaker 0: And until when the study is complete, we'll fly the fly the flag until the study is complete, basically.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. And Vice Premier, that technically is substantive motion because the original motion has been now amended. There was no withdrawal the second.\nSpeaker 0: But. But can you substitute yourself?\nSpeaker 9: Yes, you can.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, great. That's. That's we learn something every day.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, so.\nSpeaker 0: So there's that. We have a substitute motion on the floor, which is to do do a study and to fly the flag until the study is complete. That's from what I understand where we are right now.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 8: I'm good.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. Okay. Not to throw everybody.\nSpeaker 2: Sorry, everyone.\nSpeaker 0: No problem. Okay. Councilmember Superman.\nSpeaker 6: I just have to go on record as saying that I brought forth a friendly amendment based on what the speakers said, and that is what has been rejected. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just want to make one comment before the vote. Not that I want to add more work to the city manager, but I know that and I wasn't here for the whole conversation. But something that that's important to me that other cities do is other cities, when there's actual private development that happens, they actually require\nSpeaker 0: the United States American flag to be flown on private commercial development or large developments. I don't think we have that in Long Beach. And it's something that I even believe the city of Los Angeles does, where you fly the American flag when there's other large private developments.\nSpeaker 0: So can we look at those those policies when it relates to the United States flag? Separate of this flag conversation. But for because I think that would be great if we could do that. Okay. Okay. Any other conversations about this?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So there's a motion and a second on the floor. Members, please go ahead and cast your votes.\nSpeaker 2: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Motion carries. Thank you. Next up, we're going to go ahead and do item number. 13.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: 13 Eyes Council Bill 20 2-169 has passed. Moving on. Councilmember Sandoval, will you please put Council Bill 22, dash three, four, four on the floor for final passage?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, I move that. Council Bill three, four, four be placed and adopted.\nSpeaker 1: All right, we'll place three, four, four on final consideration and do pass and we've got a motion and the second thank you. The required public hearing for Council Bill 22, Dash three, four, four is open. And we have Karen here for the staff report.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Good evening. My name is Karen. I'm a principal planner with Landmark Preservation and Community Planning and Development. And we are here for the designation of three, four, three five Albion Street, which is shown here with the arrow on the property of the overview.\nSpeaker 6: This property is located in Council District eight in Northeast Park Hill. You very recently approved a rezoning from a P.O.D. to mx2x. This particular property came in as a certificate of demolition eligibility about a year ago through a facilitated stakeholder process with the property owners, the community, historic Denver Landmarks staff, a preservation minded buyer was found and\nSpeaker 6: Steve Davis has purchased the property. Steve also worked on the Butler House. So that's if you know I'm not on this particular property, you can see on the lower right image this used to be a restaurant and prior to designation the non contributing 2005 addition was removed and so it's now designating the original portion of the structure\nSpeaker 6: on the upper left photo. Here is an aerial of the property prior to the removal of the demolition of the of that of that wing. And then on the right, you see the landmark boundary, which is on sort of the lower half of the property.\nSpeaker 6: And so we wanted to show you a site plan of this particular property. Steve Davis, after rezoning is going to do a zonal split to add density to the northern portion of the site. So you can see the white box on the bottom is the landmark portion.\nSpeaker 6: And then currently under concept review with development services is the plan for the northern portion of the site to add density. So you'll have the house fence, a driveway, and then you'll have the other units that will be fronting 35th Avenue, whereas this will front Albion Street.\nSpeaker 6: As you know, for a property to be designated according to the landmark ordinance, the structure must meet, maintain its integrity, must be 30 years of age or older. The structure needs to meet at least three out of ten criteria, and the OPC needed to consider the structure's historic context.\nSpeaker 6: This property meets three of the landmark criteria which we'll go through now. So first, that it has direct association with historic event or with the historical development of the city. This particular property represents the early boom and bust of Denver in the 1890s.\nSpeaker 6: This area was developed by John Cook Jr as the North Division of Capital Hill. This was the first house that was built on speculation in this particular subdivision in 1889, and building on speculation was new to the city of Denver at that particular time.\nSpeaker 6: Unfortunately for John Cook JR investors did not follow and there weren't really many other houses built in his subdivision. This is a 1905 based map that you're looking at here, and you can see there aren't very many properties that were constructed in the area.\nSpeaker 6: The panic of 1893 occurred and the boom abruptly ended. And so this particular property represents the early boom of the 1880s and then the 1893 bust that the city went through. When the silver panic, when the silver was not used anymore.\nSpeaker 6: And you had the panic of 1893. It's also significant is really being sort of on this property that straddled the urban and rural area of Denver. This is a.\nSpeaker 7: 1933 aerial.\nSpeaker 6: And you can see even at that point, there weren't very many properties there. And so this represents sort of an area when North Park Hill was really on the edge of Denver. Here are a couple of photos of the family that resided there for the longest tenure, the row family.\nSpeaker 6: They ended up using the house as a small family farm because in the 1920s there weren't enough houses around it and that was the best use of the property. The amenities in the area were really absent for the first few decades and remained that way until the area eventually developed through the postwar era in the 1950s.\nSpeaker 6: And so it has a direct association with the development of the cities from the 1889 through the 1950s, when the row family left the property. It is also significant for its queen, an architectural style. This can be seen in the steeply pitched roof with a cross gable, the dominant front facing gable.\nSpeaker 6: Asymmetrical appearance, the two story porch. One of the things that Queen Anne is really known for is its devoid of smooth walls. So you'll see a lot of brickwork, stonework, decorative wood elements, birch boards, spindles on the porch.\nSpeaker 6: But the Queen Anne's were rather fussy and didn't want to have smooth wall appearances. And so you can see that these are the character defining features of the Queen Anne style. And then finally, it's significant under the Criterion G for promoting the understanding and appreciation of the urban environment by means of its distinctive physical characteristics and its\nSpeaker 6: rarity. So as you look at this building today with the other properties around it, it's primarily surrounded by two revivals from the twenties and thirties, minimal traditionals from the forties and fifties and postwar housing. And then some recent larger scale development.\nSpeaker 6: And the stylistic elements that are found in these tend to be more simplified. Whereas you see in the elaborate Queen in, it stands out with its extensive detailing and distinctive characteristics. And then it's also significant for its rarity in Northeast Park Hill, as well as the Greater Park Hill neighborhood.\nSpeaker 6: There are very few houses of the same vintage in Northeast Park Hill. There's the McCoy house, which was built in 1889, the same time as the Robinson House. But it's a smaller Victorian cottage to the north and this is a better example of a queen in style.\nSpeaker 6: And then within the Greater Park Hill neighborhood, there are only a handful of homes constructed before the 20th century of this style and vintage. And so it's significant for its physical characteristics and its rarity. In terms of integrity.\nSpeaker 6: We look at does the property look like what it used to look like? So there are a number of we are all the alterations on this property, but they don't distract from the Queen in styling from the front of the right of way.\nSpeaker 6: It maintains its original location. The design materials and workmanship are retained, as is the feeling, setting and association. And then the LPC considered the historic context in the period of significance of this property as is appropriate for properties that are designated.\nSpeaker 6: The historic context context match as well with the criteria for which it's designated. It represents the initial planning and expansion of Denver, the speculation and then economic collapse, the rural area of the nature of the area in the first several decades.\nSpeaker 6: And then the period of significance extends through the ownership of the longest tenured owners, the Rowe family, which sold in 1953. Overall, it is over 30 years of age. The application needs at least three of the criteria. It retains integrity and the OPC considered its historic context.\nSpeaker 6: The Landmark Preservation Commission unanimously motion to forward this for your review and CPD staff recommends approval.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you for the staff report, Kara. And this evening, we have five individuals signed up to speak. Our first speaker is in person in chambers. And it's Steven Davis.\nSpeaker 5: I'm the buyer. My wife and I, Jan, are buying this.\nSpeaker 2: Property. I do a lot of work in historic districts and I've worked on many landmarks. And the Bazaar House, as you heard up in the Highlands area. Actually, it's also known for Amanda Sandoval announced her candidacy for the city council.\nSpeaker 5: True.\nSpeaker 3: True.\nSpeaker 2: Anyway, in this process of working with this talk Denver to find or they would find homes that they wanted me to buy they would send me out there to try to wrestle away a contract or with a guy or gal.\nSpeaker 2: And and so I've had two failures in getting that accomplished. Those homes were ultimately demolished. So it's a it's an unfortunate thing. But on this particular home, for whatever reason, the seller decided to sell or the guy who had under contract and there was a good, you know, sort of exciting thing.\nSpeaker 2: And so I'm very happy to kind of pursue getting this home restored and brought back to its original glory. It's a it's a nice house. The councilman from District eight had a chance to go through it and see it prior to rehabilitation.\nSpeaker 2: So he knows what they look like and he has quite a bit of challenges. So I look forward to. Restoring the Robeson House as a new Denver landmark if the city council is able to approve the landmark designation.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Our next speaker is David Hagan, joining us virtually. Do we still have David Hagan with us? Okay. It looks like we've lost David Hagan and so we'll go ahead and move on. Michael Flowers.\nSpeaker 2: Michael Flowers. I work with Historic Denver, which is located at 1420 North Street in the old Emerson School. We are a 523 nonprofit dedicated to preserving Denver's unique identity cultural landmarks as workplaces. We fully support this designation of the Robinson House as a landmark staff discuss.\nSpeaker 2: The House helps tell the history of Denver's development, and it's one of the oldest extant houses in Northeast Parkhill. Robinson House also helps tell the story of the neighborhood from the late 19th century to now, and many still affectionately know it is.\nSpeaker 2: Kate's restaurant has been a fixture on the spot since 1889, and despite things changing around it with Steve's plan to rehabilitate the House.\nSpeaker 5: It will have a vibrant.\nSpeaker 2: Future in the neighborhood, but not always the history in Portland. It's also been valued by the community as well. The raw materials first came to our attention through our 50 Actions 50 Places campaign, which we asked the Denver community to help us identify the next 50 places to take a preservation action for the celebration of our 50th\nSpeaker 2: anniversary. Not long after receiving that nomination, the former owner of the property applied for a certificate of demolition eligibility. Community members came together to sign a notice of intent to designate. And through that process, the mediation was started to delay the issuance of the CDE.\nSpeaker 2: And during that time Steve was able to purchase the home and he's developed a plan to rehabilitate the home. But the townhomes on the north side of the property, that density and also landmarked the property. So as I said before, we fully support this this landmark designation.\nSpeaker 2: And I hope you will, too. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Our next speaker is joining us via Zoom, Tess Dougherty. Do we have tests with us? Okay. We're trying to get you to accept the promotion test since we have you signed up. Well, given another try here.\nSpeaker 1: Still no acceptance. Okay. We'll go ahead and move on to our last speaker this evening, Jesse Paris. Okay. Go ahead, please, with your comments, Jesse. Jesse, you can go ahead with your comments. It's looking like from our end the just season muted.\nSpeaker 1: So we'll. Try it once more. Go ahead, Jesse. Are we having an issue with Zoom or anything? All right. Well, we have just in the queue, but I'm not. Hearing from him. Okay. We're going to go ahead and move on then.\nSpeaker 1: That concludes our speakers this evening for this required public hearing. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 344 Council Member CdeBaca Thank you.\nSpeaker 8: Not questions. Just a thank you for saving this little house. This is the house I drive by almost every day, and I have hoped that somebody would see the beauty in it. And I also hope that you guys will add to the history that the first museum for black girls was in that building right in the last\nSpeaker 8: year or two. And hopefully they blow up and do all the cool things that they're doing across the country. Charlie Billingsley is awesome and fully expect her to go down in history and you guys will have been the first place where she exhibited the museum for Black Girls.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca. And not seeing anyone else in the queue will close the public hearing. And any comments from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash three, four, four. And thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca, for sharing that history.\nSpeaker 1: And Councilmember Herndon, do you have any comments?\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. Just I urge my colleagues to support this. I think the criteria has been met. I was in this when it was a restaurant, however long ago it was. And I do appreciate historic Denver and all the parties who came together to save this and be able to do the rezoning so that we can\nSpeaker 2: still designate the building and still allow for gentle density to happen on that parcel as well just to the north. So thank you all and I look forward to seeing it when it's complete. And thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Herndon. Councilmember Sandoval.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President. I just want to give a shout out to the Davises for being such thoughtful, historic preservationists. I know my predecessor called on you a lot. I know I've called on you a lot. So any time we see these diamonds in a rough, I know that I can call on you and you can go\nSpeaker 4: out there and use all the skills that you had working on all the projects in Denver. The Bosley House is my favorite. I see Jan walking by my house every day and then I want to go walk by United House.\nSpeaker 4: So just want to thank you and thank you for the partnership with Historic Denver and also just want to call out the process that when we opened up the historic ordinance, you know, there was a lot of concern of what would happen with that historic ordinance and adding this mediation and this pause to be able to get\nSpeaker 4: the applicant and other people at the table to talk, which is part of democracy, is talking about what our intentions are, have actually come with good results. So just want to thank everyone for their work. Those are not easy conversations.\nSpeaker 4: I've been in them as a council aide and as a council member when you're talking about property and property rights and values. So just want to say that thank you to everyone who had a great outcome because this could ended in a different way, which we all know too well in northwest Denver.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And likewise, I think that this meets all of the criteria. I'm very happy to support it and see it once it's restored in all its glory. And so thank you to the property owners for doing that well and Karen for her untiring patience and work on preservation in our city.\nSpeaker 1: We really appreciate that. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 20 2-344. Herndon.\nSpeaker 6: I High Cashman can each i. Ortega Sandoval.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 7: Sawyer I.\nSpeaker 3: Torres I. Black I.

And we think it's a combination of, you know, it's COVID 19.\nSpeaker 2: People are working from home, so maybe they have a little more time to focus on some local issues. But I think with all the layers of issues we've been dealing with since the spring, people have really focused on how can I make a difference?\nSpeaker 2: And one of the things I love hearing when I'm interviewing and I always conduct the interviews with whoever the city staff is who staffs that Border Commission. But if people are saying they just want to give back, they love living here, they want to give back.\nSpeaker 2: And I'm really excited that we have a combination of folks who've lived here while we've got newcomers, and they all bring so much talent and energy to the to the table. So thank you all and welcome. And so, Madam Clerk, this is where and I see we've got Adam Gillett, who's a graphic artist who is on he's\nSpeaker 2: returning.

Next up is item 16, which is. Stars.\nSpeaker 1: Report from Development Services Recommendation of declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code related to short term rentals. Read the first time and lead up to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading and adopt a resolution to submit the ordinance amendments to the Coastal Commission citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I think this is a staff report.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We do have a report to give you kind of the history and the background of staffers and remind us of kind of where this where this sits. I will ask Linda Tatum, our director of development services, and Charles Staver from Development Services, to go through the report.\nSpeaker 2: An evening Mayor and City Council. We've had a team working on this.\nSpeaker 1: Project for the last couple of.\nSpeaker 2: Years, and that team includes the Our Administrative and Financial Services Bureau manager Lisa Fall and Jill Stauber, our real estate project coordinator. So Jill will give a brief overview of the proposed ordinance.\nSpeaker 6: All right. Good evening. In January of this year, staff presented a draft ordinance regulating short term rentals. And we are back tonight for a new first reading following that discussion. This brief presentation provides a recap of the proposed regulations and also highlights the changes requested by council in January.\nSpeaker 6: With the slide forward. Okay for some background in 2017. At the request of City Council staff conducted research and recommended hiring a consultant to conduct a more thorough study. Throughout 2018, we held a series of community outreach events.\nSpeaker 6: An online survey conducted several case studies and presented our findings and recommendations to City Council for discussion. At that time, Council instructed the city attorney to draft an ordinance in 2019. Staff responded to additional questions, created a phased implementation plan, and executed a voluntary tax collection agreement with Airbnb, and ultimately drafted an ordinance allowing for limited staffers\nSpeaker 6: . Then in January of this year, the Council discussed the item and requested some changes to the ordinance. So here's a recap of some key elements of the ordinance and establishes that we vocal annual city registration and fee protects the housing stock by limiting the number of non primary residence staffers citywide to no more than 1000 units.\nSpeaker 6: Includes enforcement provisions and a mechanism to remove individual bad actors. Requires a limited event permit to exceed the maximum occupancy limits. And allows residential property owners to petition for a prohibition on Unhosted staffers in their neighborhood. The slide shows the maximum number of stars any one operator would be allowed to operate.\nSpeaker 6: As a reminder, a primary residence star is defined as the unit where the host resides at least 275 nights per year. And during that time, any guest stays are considered hosted and there's no limit on hosted stays. So that would only leave up to 90 days maximum per year in which that unit could be rented as an\nSpeaker 6: unhosted stay. By definition, it's also worth noting that the majority of operators in Long Beach are currently operating only one unit. Here are just some of the basic regulations, including collection of transient occupancy tax. Homeowners associations may request inclusion on a STR prohibited properties list.\nSpeaker 6: Occupancy is limited to two guests per legally permitted bedroom plus two with a maximum of ten guests and staffers are prohibited and deed restricted. Affordable housing units, dormitories and adus. Yeah. And the enforcement provisions of the ordinance are the key to dealing with operators that do not abide by the rules.\nSpeaker 6: Violations would be subject to $1,000 fine per day, except a 30 day warning period shall be provided for advertising in store without a valid registration. And of course, you only get one of those. There is a 24 seven complaint hotline with a live operator upon issuance of three fines.\nSpeaker 6: The STR registration may be revoked. Violations include but are not limited to failure of local contact to take action to a complaint within one hour of completing a booking transaction without a valid city issued registration number. Violations of STR.\nSpeaker 6: Maximum occupancy. And conduct. Or activities that constitute a public nuisance. In order for the program to be successful, we'll need the cooperation of the hosting platforms, particularly for removing listings that have not registered or have had their registrations revoked.\nSpeaker 6: So hosting platforms cannot complete any booking transactions for an STR. If notified by the city that a valid SDR registration number has not been issued to the operator platform, so remove any listings upon notification from the city and on a monthly basis the platform so provide to the city.\nSpeaker 6: The SDR registration number of each listing name of operator address of the SDR unit number of days each unit was booked and the total price paid for each rental. The petition to prohibit Unhosted stickers is one of the areas that the council asks us to take a closer look at in January.\nSpeaker 6: So there are a couple of changes the property owners can petition to prohibit unhosted stars within a census tract or block group, and I'll discuss the group in more detail in the coming slide. Is now a simple majority of the residential property owners that must sign a petition to prohibit unhosted stays.\nSpeaker 6: Upon request for the city to initiate a petition, signatures will be collected by the city staff via US mail. If the petition is approved, the restriction remains in effect for three years, at which point the restriction can be lifted by a similar petition process.\nSpeaker 6: The initial petition process is available within 180 days of the effective date, and a new 180 day petition process period shall be established annually thereafter. The boundary of the prohibition we had previously recommended using the census tract. But there is some concern that a full census tract was too large an area and also that the corresponding cost\nSpeaker 6: could be prohibitive. So a census tract is still an option for your consideration tonight. But what staff is now recommending is using the census block group. A census block group is a geographical unit used by the United States Census Bureau, which is between the census block and the census tract.\nSpeaker 6: All census tracts in Long Beach consist of between three and eight census block groups. Using block groups also increases the petitioning party's chance for a successful petition for those more localized neighborhoods that have a strong desire to opt out.\nSpeaker 6: To give you a visual idea of a census tract versus a census. BLOCK We're going to show you two maps of the same census tract. So this map shows one residential census tract surrounded by the black lines. And the next.\nSpeaker 6: And this is the same census tract showing the census block groups within that tract. So there are six block groups within that census tract, their smaller geographical drop geographically. And this is the the boundary that we are now proposing.\nSpeaker 6: So pending council action tonight. This would be our updated timeline for implementing the ordinance. If the reading is approved tonight, then the final reading would be June 2nd. But the ordinance would not go into effect for an additional 121 days or four months, during which time the registration process would be set up.\nSpeaker 6: And we would select the compliance monitoring consultant. The initial registration period would last 160 days over a six month full register, full enforcement would begin at the end of that initial registration period. And just to clarify, the initial 180 days is not the only opportunity you have to register.\nSpeaker 6: People will be allowed to apply for registration after the initial 180 days. The next step would be to adopt an ordinance amending Title 21 of the municipal code. That's the zoning code, submit the local Coastal Program Amendment to the California Coastal Commission for approval and develop the implementation guidelines, which would be the actual registration process.\nSpeaker 6: That concludes the reports. We are happy to answer questions. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Let me. I have a motion and a second, Councilmember Pierce, and then a second I think is going to be by Councilman Price. But let me turn this over to Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Great. Thank you so much. I really want to say how much I appreciate staff's work on this and. Hey, Robert. Oh, man. I like when people use video. I appreciate staff's work on this. I appreciate the years that we have trying to get this right.\nSpeaker 4: And I think it's unfortunate that we're bringing this forward in a period of COVID, because when we brought this forward, it was a time when our economy was strong, our hospitality industry was around 78% occupancy. Our housing needed to be looked at.\nSpeaker 4: We saw housing prices increasing every month. And so today it is not that reality. But I want to recognize the value that short term rentals have for mom and pops that, you know, if they need the additional income that they're in their house and they're saying that we want to make sure that this is something that that\nSpeaker 4: can bring them that additional revenue. And so I say all of that because I think that it's important that we realize that we are not in the same era that we were when we brought this item forward originally and I moved my motion.\nSpeaker 4: So they are so organized and I got unorganized. Okay. So trying to find the balance in between small business owners who host their homes, the native visitors that desire alternatives to hotels, the necessity of the city to protect our neighborhoods while allowing us to in the budget needs for enforcing this ordinance.\nSpeaker 4: This council has worked very hard to strike that balance. And COVID 19 hit. Our hotels have been hit hard. They've stayed engaged, working with the city, working with the health department to implement training and cleaning standards within all of their hotels.\nSpeaker 4: Meanwhile, we have not had a substantive conversation about what the future of stars means in a COVID era. So before I make my motion, I actually have some questions for the city staff around the health orders and how short term rentals fall into to play within our health orders.\nSpeaker 4: Are they deemed essential? Do we have cleaning standards for them? And so staff, if you could answer some of those questions for me, that'd be great.\nSpeaker 2: We do have the city attorney on the line, Councilwoman Pierce, and he is prepared.\nSpeaker 1: To respond to that.\nSpeaker 2: That question regarding the city's health order. And that is city attorney and deputy city attorney Mike Mays.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Mr. Mes or Ms.. Galatia.\nSpeaker 4: If. They're not.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, Councilman Pierce, member of City Council. Can you hear me, Mike?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: All right. Currently, the health order, the city's existing health order does not directly mentioned short term rentals. It is not considered to be an essential business. So therefore, under the order, if the ordinance was passed tonight, under the current order, short term rentals would still not be allowed until the order is released or amended once, but several\nSpeaker 3: more times, probably. So it's not directly covered. The ordinance itself, as you said, Councilman Pearce was drafted in a different era before COVID. So there are no standards written into the ordinance that pertain to cleaning and sanitizing anything of that nature.\nSpeaker 3: It was just assumed that the operators would come. So there isn't any guidelines in the current ordinance to address that issue.\nSpeaker 4: Right. Thank you for that. And I expect that as businesses are coming back on, as the phases are changing, that there will be new standards applied to each one of those at that time. I do want to offer for transparency.\nSpeaker 4: I want to share with everyone that I did ask if there was a way to postpone this item so that we weren't hearing it in the middle of COVID. But we do have other items that are really important, like the Mello Act and our inclusionary housing and staff has worked really hard on this, and from the presentation\nSpeaker 4: that they just shared, it is going to take, you know, 120 days to be able to get this program up and going. And so we know that it wouldn't be like tomorrow. We just signed this and it would go into place.\nSpeaker 4: So with that being said, with the consideration of our local economy. One other note before I make my motion, I'd also like to note that that I appreciate the hotels being at the table, but I also recognize that thanks to measures like Measure W hotels have cleaning standards in place, that we understand what the workload is and\nSpeaker 4: that there's oversight. I think we've all. I know most of us have probably stayed at an Airbnb by now or a short term rental and have great experiences. But we all have that one experience where something wasn't clean to the tee.\nSpeaker 4: And so I think this is a good time for us to to pause on non hosted and really make sure that we have a good policy in place for the health and safety of anybody that might be staying in one.\nSpeaker 4: So with that, I have a motion that I'd like to make and I know that Councilmember Price has some comments to. I, I'd hope that you guys hear this motion with the full belief that that we should move forward with a program that is respectful of our tenants, of our small business owners, and of all the work\nSpeaker 4: that we have done through the years. So with that, my motion is to adopt the ordinance as written with the following changes only permit the operated operation of hosted expires at this time in accordance with Long Beach's COVID 19 health orders and related protocols.\nSpeaker 4: Request staff to work with the hosting platforms and other regulatory agencies, including the city's health department, to develop cleaning and sanitizing protocols specific to the operations of short term rentals, with an emphasis on standards for non hosted rentals.\nSpeaker 4: Prohibit the operation of non hosted staffers for a period of at least six months until and until city staff presents a report to the Council for a vote to reconsider amending the ordinance to permit non hosted stays. The report should contain the following information.\nSpeaker 4: Proposed cleaning and sanitizing protocols as recommended by the Health Department. Information regarding the economic impact of COVID 19 on the tourism industry in the city of Long Beach. A report on the transit occupancy tax paid to the cities by hotels and staffers during the last three years.\nSpeaker 4: The number of registered permitted staffers in the city since adoption of the ordinance in the city's housing rental housing vacancy at the time of the report. I've spoken with the city attorney's office and it's my understanding that these changes to the ordinance that could be made because of the motion will require that the ordinance be brought to\nSpeaker 4: City Council for another first reading and hopeful adoption. I. I hope that there is support for this. I feel like it's measured, it's thoughtful, considering where we're at and considering that it would that it would be only really two months of hosting while staff has the opportunity to do the work on the back end, to set up\nSpeaker 4: the structure, to make sure that there is enforcement and registration and all of those pieces as well. I think the work that we did the last time on the council took a lot of work. But I believe that the language that we have in place right now is the best language for our our city, based on my\nSpeaker 4: conversations with development services and their wish to maintain the language as we have it now. So with that, that's my motion. So I look forward to hearing your comments. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. The second is by Councilwoman Rice.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Can you hear me, Mr. Mayor?\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Thank you. And thank you to the staff for your comments on this. And thank you to Councilwoman Pierce for making the motion. I want to reiterate that I spent quite a bit of time talking with staff about the proposed ordinance and making sure that the preferred language that they have proposed is what I encourage my\nSpeaker 2: colleagues to adopt tonight. These are. These are novel issues to some extent for the city. And I think staff has included language in here that will allow the staff to better regulate this industry in the city as we as we welcome it as a as an operating and legitimate business in the city.\nSpeaker 2: So I think having staff's preferred wording in here in terms of the regulations of both the STR operator as well as the the host platform I think is very important. And so I am going to be asking my colleagues to support staff language.\nSpeaker 2: I do have a couple of clarification points and I think I know the answer. But just for the record. Councilmember Pearce, the unhosted stars that they would face in no earlier than six months from the adoption of the ordinance.\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct? Correct. So that would allow hosted to begin and get phased in, which would take about 120 days. And then somewhere around then is when I imagine staff will give us a report on the Unhosted regulations and the items that you thoughtfully included in the report back.\nSpeaker 2: And then hopefully then at that point is when we would go into the Unhosted phase, which would be about two months after the hosted is already online.\nSpeaker 4: I think that timeline's. Right? Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Okay, great. Okay. So for staff, I have I do have a question. Slide seven of your presentation, is that consistent with the language in Section 5.7, 7.50 sub a? I just want to make sure that the language on Slide seven is consistent with what's proposed in the ordinance, which is that the burden would be on the hosting\nSpeaker 2: platform. My understanding is. To make sure that they include the registration numbers that. Correct. That is correct. Is the the the ordinance that's proposed includes that language. With a burden on the platform. Okay. I just want to make sure because when I looked at Slide seven and again, I'm looking at it very quickly here in the course\nSpeaker 2: of the the meeting and haven't had a chance to analyze it. But I just want to make sure that we're consistent. And it's my understanding that although the hosting platforms may not prefer that model, that's a model that staff believe will best allow it to enforce the order.\nSpeaker 2: Is that correct?\nSpeaker 1: That is correct.\nSpeaker 2: And I say that because a major component, Councilmember Pearce and I, I believe it's districts two and three that have the majority of the short term rentals that we know of right now. Is that correct? That is correct.\nSpeaker 2: And I know that one of the issues that we have to balance, in addition to the requests and the desires of the hosting platforms that I know have contacted, council offices is the needs and the interests and the concerns of the residents.\nSpeaker 2: And regulation of the stars and neighborhoods is very, very important. So I just want to make it clear, as I have from day one, that my goal would be that staff would have the tools that it needs to help easily regulate this industry so that we are mitigating neighborhood impacts such as noise and parking and public safety\nSpeaker 2: . So I just want to confirm I know that the. Hosting platforms, you know, maybe want prefer different language. But I did speak with staff and I know staff has a strong preference for this language. Correct. That is correct.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. And then I. And so I'm going to support that because I want to do whatever I can to help regulation be as easy as possible for staff. And I do know that staff is also willing to sit with with the hosting platforms after this ordinance is approved to figure out how to make that particular requirement and\nSpeaker 2: that language hopefully workable for all parties. Yes, we've made it very clear that we'd like to sit down with them and explore best practices as we develop the administrative procedures associated with the ordinance. Okay. And I know you will do that.\nSpeaker 2: But since this is perhaps not language that would have been selected initially by the hosts and platforms, I urge you and your team to do whatever you can to try to have a meeting of the minds of how to best effectuate your intent in accordance with how they're used to running their operations.\nSpeaker 2: If there's an opportunity to to have a meeting of the minds, I would I would hope that that can be accomplished. And then on page 12, the language about the 180 dead. Oh, by the way, my I would like to offer a friendly to this motion that we adopt the opt out provision as to census tract blocks\nSpeaker 2: , not census tracts. So hopefully that's okay with you, Councilwoman Pierce?\nSpeaker 4: Yes, that's fine with me.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Can we clarify, Councilwoman Pierce, that you meant the census block group, the the lower level. Councilwoman Pryce and Councilwoman Pierce. Yes. We want the census block groups. Okay. Thank you. So my question in regards to that is the 180 days I know I talked with you about this earlier, Ms..\nSpeaker 2: Tatum, but on page 12, you know, the the language of how that 180 days would roll out. I understand the intent of it, but the language of how that would roll out and how neighborhood associations.\nSpeaker 4: Or block.\nSpeaker 2: Neighborhood track blocks would know when the 180 day period is up. I'm not sure if there's a way to fine tune that language a little bit more. Councilwoman, we we actually have proposed some language that fine tuned it and the city attorney is proposing to use that language.\nSpeaker 2: It does not change the intent or the substance of it in any way. The language is just rewritten to be a little bit clearer. Great. Thank you. That's. That's all I wanted to make sure. And then with that, then I have nothing further.\nSpeaker 2: And I just want to thank staff for their excellent work on this. Thank you, everyone.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. You see, I got. Next on the list is Councilwoman Mongo. Are you muted? Councilman Mongo. Okay, I'm moving on to Councilman and day house.\nSpeaker 4: Hello. Hello.\nSpeaker 2: There she is. Go ahead. Oh.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Thank you. Um, I guess I was hoping to find out the. Safer. The safety of our residents is of utmost concern to me and the safety of our residents, especially our hosts. Obviously, they can choose not to participate and not host when people come into town.\nSpeaker 4: But I would think that from a COVID perspective, Unhosted would be safer than the hosted. Now, I don't want to change the motion. I just think it's important. The lifeblood of a lot of these neighbors income is completely zero right now, and they are hoping that they're able to get the supplemental income or primary income in some\nSpeaker 4: cases back in place. And so I appreciate the balance. I also see that we've received communication, that there are already cleaning protocols that have been issued to some of the platforms limf hosts. I think this is important because right now across the region, we have first responders who are being sheltered in a lot of these platforms, vacancies\nSpeaker 4: during their COVID quarantine period. So they're cleaning protocols are there. I want to make sure that we keep that in mind and don't give a misunderstanding or misconception to the community. I actually think that measure w while it did provide a limit on the number of square feet that can be cleaned by a hotel, I don't think\nSpeaker 4: it came with specific cleaning protocols. And if it did, I would imagine that COVID would would potentially even increase those. And so I rely upon the management of those organizations to do a good job in bringing that forward in the same way that I would hope that these platforms would bring forward that work.\nSpeaker 4: And I say that because our staff is extremely overworked right now with COVID, it is very, very difficult for me to see additional time to be carved out for issues like this. And I appreciate Councilman Pearce's statements related to not wanting to put it on hold again.\nSpeaker 4: They've done so much work so far. I would just be cautious about the depth of the amount of information and what's available and the cost of that information. We often have to outsource that to vendors and consultants and that consultant.\nSpeaker 4: Money on those reports could be kept in-house to pay for our plumbers and our carpenters and our parks and rec staff. And so $100,000 report to me is not that high of a priority. So I guess what I would ask Councilman Pearce to do is put a financial limit on it for for it to be gathered through\nSpeaker 4: city resources only because when we're at the at the chopping block where we're cutting park programs and library hours. I think we all just need to work hard on pulling data from the sources that are out there and really limiting our contractors.\nSpeaker 4: Is that something you'd be open to? This is Pearce. Yeah, I believe there's two things that I've asked for, and this are all things that either our health department, our economic development team or development services team could provide.\nSpeaker 4: I appreciate that very much. I know that the city manager had previous a previous city manager often used his management consultant fund. And I just didn't want us tapping into that under any circumstance like this. I think that that kind of consultant is is really more important to be paid towards our city workers and the the the\nSpeaker 4: time that we need them. Next, I'd like to kind of just repeat something that Councilman Price said. I completely agree that the platforms are really responsible for telling us who that we if we tell them there is a violator.\nSpeaker 4: Miss Tatum, in our discussion the other day, if we tell them the following, 15 homes are in violation of our policy. Is it your understanding that the language in the ordinance today states that it would then be the time for the platform to remove them from the platform?\nSpeaker 2: That is that is correct. The ordinance has written with a couple of purposes in mind.\nSpeaker 1: If we identify an.\nSpeaker 2: Unregistered ACR, we can ask them to remove it and they would be obligated to do so. However, the first premise of the ordinance is that they should not put up on the website any stars that do not have a city registration number.\nSpeaker 2: So we have come at it in the ordinance from both directions.\nSpeaker 4: And then if a person were to lie with a fake registration number or type in the registration number, that's not truthful. The platform is also providing us on a regular basis some data about who is on their platform that we can verify against our own sources to let them know that there's a piece of a host that's\nSpeaker 4: not appropriate.\nSpeaker 2: That is correct, as well as the additional resources of a consultant who specializes in data mining and having, I guess, a way to check that information. So, yes, we would have that available and the ordinance calls out for that specifically.\nSpeaker 4: And then if a host is potentially violating the 90 days, we would possibly get a report from neighbors. And then we would, as a city, let that platform know or let multiple platforms know because they may be only doing 90 days on one platform but say 90 days on another platform.\nSpeaker 4: But we would let all the platforms know and then the platforms would be required to let us know how many days that facility had been rented.\nSpeaker 2: That is correct, because the 90 days is a 90 day limit on the unit, not on each platform.\nSpeaker 4: Right. So then we as a city would have to take that data in to verify. Okay. On this platform, they did 50 days and on that platform they did 50 days. So thus they're in violation. And then we would then notify the platform that they are in violation of the city policy and they need to be taken\nSpeaker 4: down for the remainder of the year. Or would they lose their permit?\nSpeaker 2: They if they violate or exceed the 90 days and we can document that they would indeed be cited for a violation and that would count as one of the three violations that they're allowed before they would proceed to the revocation step for the as to our license.\nSpeaker 0: Just before we continue, I. I think that there's maybe a crickets or maybe someone's outside. Diane. The crickets are really loud.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: It's okay.\nSpeaker 4: It's the baby's inside asleep, though. And when I talk, I'll wake her up.\nSpeaker 0: Well, we'll take have as the sounds of the fifth district.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: I just want to make sure that that was. Maybe that was catwoman's life. Just everyone else's muted. That's what those are. That sound is. Ah, crickets. So that's fine, you know, really.\nSpeaker 4: Crickets. Thank you. And then just to provide some additional clarity and. When? If. If we pass this tonight, it will come back for second reading and then implementation will start in six months from the second reading.\nSpeaker 3: With.\nSpeaker 4: Once that implementation happens.\nSpeaker 2: Then the.\nSpeaker 4: Unhosted. Right after that it sounded like a council in Pearce added in an additional vote to the council or something, because I get some clarity on that. Yes. Councilmember Mungo. The motion that I made says that staff need to do a report with.\nSpeaker 4: In six months. And at that time the council would vote on what would be appropriate for non hosted stars. And the reason for that is that this entire ACR policy was crafted when we were in a very different economic situation and a very different situation with our hospitality industry.\nSpeaker 4: And so giving us some, some more tools in the toolbox before we decided on what that appropriate number is. So yes. Oh, you're saying? I guess my concern is if we're only allowing a thousand citywide and we're only started starting with.\nSpeaker 4: Posted. Theoretically, all 1000 spots could be filled by hosted. Is that correct? That is not correct. Okay. Help me. Posted is on unlimited. It said that the number that thousand was non-votes. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That helps.\nSpeaker 4: This motion allows for hosted to go forward now, and there's not a limit on those. And then it says, let's look at the economics and then come back and then have a discussion about what what non hosted looks like.\nSpeaker 4: And our housing market might be very different. We have no idea what it will look like at that time. So it makes it very difficult to bring on an entirely new, quote unquote new industry to the city in a time like what we're having right now.\nSpeaker 4: The question would be to Mr. Modica, we have been budgeting revenue for and hosted and hosted and we've been receiving that revenue. So what is your prediction if the motion on the floor to pass in the amount of cuts we would need to make?\nSpeaker 4: Due to the loss in revenue of. Potential.\nSpeaker 2: An Unhosted.\nSpeaker 4: Non allowable. Airbnb, the RBA, whatever.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So that is something we want to bring back to you at the first reading when this comes back. So there's two components of it. One is the. On General Airbnb, which they had just been it been we had done the agreement and it's gone the general trend that certainly has gone down because of COVID.\nSpeaker 5: So that's one impact. The second is we were planning on charging the cost of the program to the thousand units for non hosted through a registration fee as well as hosted. So with the reductions the Council is making, that's going to be a smaller amount of people who are going to be paying those registration fees.\nSpeaker 5: So we will come back with an estimate of how we're going to do that. It will likely be a smaller enforcement type program. So we know we may not be able to do all the enforcement that was originally envisioned until we get to a larger program and we'll report back on that when this comes back.\nSpeaker 4: Councilman. What was the number? I'm sorry. Just one quick thing. Mr. Modica, do we know what the number was that we were projecting in those registrations in fiscal year 20?\nSpeaker 5: Well, 800,000 was the TOTY, I believe, or. I'm sorry. 800 stars. You're. Yeah. Lisa forward would say that under the mike. I don't think you could hear that.\nSpeaker 1: As part of the Fy20 budget process, we had made a conservative estimate that there would be 800 staffers registered. That was because when we were first doing our estimates, we had assumed that.\nSpeaker 4: Only property.\nSpeaker 1: Owners in the city would be allowed. But with the change to the cap.\nSpeaker 4: That number then did increase.\nSpeaker 1: But we did not change the budget estimate with the registration being $250. The total revenue budgeted for FY 20 was $200,000.\nSpeaker 4: Million, 200,000 and registration fees and 800 and top of which the total is split 5050 with the city. So that would be a 100,000. No, the 800 was the number of stars generating the 200,000 and.\nSpeaker 3: In registration fees.\nSpeaker 1: The estimates for total.\nSpeaker 4: I'm not sure what was budgeted this year. But I.\nSpeaker 6: Believe that.\nSpeaker 1: So far this year, 1.6 million has come in for FY 20.\nSpeaker 5: So that would be the 800,000. That would be the 800 split into the two different funds. So 800 and general fund, 800 in SAP. So that's the numbers off the top of our head will reconfirm that when this comes back.\nSpeaker 4: And so, Miss Pearce, are you okay that we're going to move forward the way we are now? And would you be open to the process coming back September 1st so we could still record that 200,000 of revenue before year end on the registrations?\nSpeaker 4: I think that there's. There's a couple of things that maybe need clarifying. One is that we're only talking about a two month period in between when hosted would be on board and the conversation would come back around on hosting.\nSpeaker 4: It's a two month period. It's not a long period. The second piece is that these projections and these numbers staff is giving you are based in an economic time. When our hotels were at 80% capacity, nearly 78% capacity when the economy was strong.\nSpeaker 4: We have a stay at home order right now. So it doesn't matter what number we say right now. These are still not deemed to be operating nonessential businesses right now. So what I'm asking for is for us to consider the economic time that we're in right now and and be able to have that conversation in six months\nSpeaker 4: . So I don't think that the calculations are as big as it would be if we would have made this decision in a non-covid time, which I think is why Councilmember Price and I are. You are here. And I think we we need to just move the motion as it is.\nSpeaker 4: I've tried to be really thoughtful about the entire process and all SDR, so I'd like us to move forward with the motion as it is, as supported by Councilmember Price and and hear what my other colleagues have to say right now.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Mango. Anything else?\nSpeaker 4: Well, yeah, I'd like to finish my sentence. I'm not asking for the delay. I recognize 60 days doesn't seem like a lot, but it's a difference of ending a fiscal year upside down or right side up. And I know 200,000, $250,000 doesn't seem like a lot, but $250,000 is two or three or four plumbers.\nSpeaker 4: And so I recognize that this is a time and again, this is I'm not talking about the million dollars that 800,000 times plus $800,000. Those are both also a big risk of loss. But again, registration fees are a person paying a fee, even though there are no reservations.\nSpeaker 4: And so my ask is only not to approve the unhosted today, but just that the Unhosted presentation come back September one. A couple of things. At least you'll still be on the council if it goes into November, you won't.\nSpeaker 4: And I thought you'd want to still be a part of this discussion. The presentation could be September 1st. Still, a decision doesn't necessarily need to be made that day. And again, it still could be two months later. I was just asking for the presentation to come back sooner because so many things are changing so rapidly.\nSpeaker 4: I appreciate that. I don't think that the presentation coming back that soon will give us a full understanding of what's happened to the tourism industry or be able to provide us with the data that that I've requested in my motion.\nSpeaker 4: So I. Okay, well, I'll think about it. And if I feel strongly, then maybe I'll agenda it as a separate item. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman in Dallas.\nSpeaker 2: Aaron, I'll keep this really quick because I know that we have a lot on the agenda. I just wanted to say thank you to staff for all of their years of working on this. And thank you to all the council members who have brought this item to where it is today, especially council members Pierce and Price.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. I think it's very important that we realize that there's going to be a lot of cuts that are being done and that in the next six months, maybe another, a lot of people will be using these short term rentals, the unhosted ones, because we are all you know, we all have to be very\nSpeaker 2: careful of traveling right now our, you know, just for safety reasons. So I just wanted to say support this item as is. And thank you very much for bringing it forward.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman de Haas, Councilwoman Press.\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. I do have one quick question, and that is I just was looking at the audience right now, and I cannot believe that I missed this. But in regards to the area that where we talked about the opt out.\nSpeaker 2: So on page 11. 5.77.080 since we're going to be adding some different language for the 180 days and since this is going to come back for a first reading anyway, I wanted to have some language in there that made it a little bit clearer of the fact that you need the majority of the property owners for the\nSpeaker 2: petition to prevail. And also, we had talked on January 21st about the fact that I wanted to make sure that those who were circulating the petitions were property owners, because one of the concerns that I have is we don't want people paying folks that don't have a vested interest in that neighborhood to be circulating petitions.\nSpeaker 2: So that was something that was that that was very clearly an intent of mine. So I'm wondering if Councilmember Pearce, if you're okay with them clarifying that intent, which was the intent from January 21st under somewhere under section 5.77.080 and making it clear how many votes are needed to prevail on this.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Price, I'm sorry to interrupt you.\nSpeaker 4: But I'm on.\nSpeaker 1: Section B of that section, page 12, line three. It talks about the petition must include the signatures, printed names and addresses of a majority of the property owners of residential real property. Does that address your concern?\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Okay. So that's good. I see that that wording there now. Thank you. But what about the prohibition against signature gatherers?\nSpeaker 3: What? Anyway.\nSpeaker 1: Because this.\nSpeaker 4: Is being done by mail gathering.\nSpeaker 1: Signatures.\nSpeaker 3: They wouldn't people.\nSpeaker 1: Would be stopped in the street to get the signature.\nSpeaker 2: And we will be it would only be by mail.\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Tonight.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Got it. Thank you. I appreciate that. Those are two things that I wanted clarification on. So that makes sense to me. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Roll call. Vote, please, on the motion.\nSpeaker 6: District one.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 3: District two.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 6: District three.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 6: District four.\nSpeaker 3: High District five.\nSpeaker 4: II.\nSpeaker 3: District six.\nSpeaker 6: District seven. I. District eight.\nSpeaker 3: All right.\nSpeaker 6: District nine.\nSpeaker 3: I. Ocean carries.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right. We have a full agenda, so I'm going to go through the next ten items we have. Should be rather quick. And then we have two items that will take a little more time because they're both a presentation.\nSpeaker 0: So let me go to these other items. They should go rather quickly and then we'll get to the other items. Item item 15, please.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 2: We do have three proclamations this evening, and I'd like to call on Councilman Lopez to read proclamation number 403.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. I want to welcome this. Proclamation is a proclamation we do every year, and it's a proclamation recognizing May 2014 as Hepatitis Awareness Month. And this is proclamation number 403. So the 2014 whereas today is national hepatitis testing day, hepatitis C is recognized as the most common blood borne viral infection in the United States\nSpeaker 3: . And. WHEREAS, Hepatitis C has infected an estimated 85,000 Coloradans, as many as 4 million American residents, nearly two out of every 100 persons and more than 200 million people worldwide. And. Whereas, it is a leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and the number one reason for liver transplants in the United States.\nSpeaker 3: And. Whereas, most Americans die of hepatitis C than from HIV making hepatitis C one of the top preventable causes of death in the United States. And. Whereas, approximately 15,000 hepatitis C related deaths occur annually in the United States and is expected to triple in the next 10 to 20 years.\nSpeaker 3: And. WHEREAS, people born between 1945 and 1965 are five times more likely to be infected than any other adult. Nearly three in four people with hep C were born between 1945. And 1965, and many remain unaware of their status without participating in screening efforts.\nSpeaker 3: And. WHEREAS, the incidence of hepatitis C disproportionately affects minority communities. And. WHEREAS, 75% of infected persons do not show any signs or symptoms leading to the Hep C virus to cause poor health outcomes and be labeled as the silent epidemic.\nSpeaker 3: And. Whereas, new drugs were approved that significantly increase the cure rate among hep C patients seeking treatment and even more effective treatments are on the horizon. And. Whereas, risk factors can be evaluated, evaluated, hep C can be prevented.\nSpeaker 3: Testing can detect the Hep C virus infections and early diagnosis and treatment can save lives, money and resources. And. Whereas, Hep C connection is available as a local resource for education testing, linkage to care and support. Now therefore being proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver.\nSpeaker 3: Section one. The Denver City Council agrees that preventing and treating Hep C is an important public health initiative that will improve the quality of life for all Denver residents affected by the virus. Section two of the Denver City Council proclaimed proclaims the month of May as Hepatitis Awareness Month and recognizes July 28, 2014 as World Hepatitis Day\nSpeaker 3: . Section three that the Clerk of the city and County of Denver's our test and Fix the seal of the city and County of Denver to this proclamation and a copy be transmitted to Nancy Steinfurth, the executive director of the Hep C Connection.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Lopez, your motion to adopt.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm president I move that council proclamation number four of three series of 2014 be adopted.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. Comments by Council. Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. I have the honor, like I said earlier, to carry this proclamation every year. I think almost since for the last six years, I think six or seven years. The first year was traditionally Councilmember Garcia used to read this.\nSpeaker 3: He was not here that day. So I took it up and it was his last. So I get to revisit this really cool proclamation. And I read this proclamation because hep-C is preventable. This is something that with education, with outreach, with access to the resources, we can prevent it.\nSpeaker 3: This is something that is a serious viral infection. This is something that kills a lot of people every year. And I read this proclamation because it killed my grandfather. My grandfather was a World War Two vet, served in Germany.\nSpeaker 3: Born and raised in Colorado. And called Denver home every year after his after that, when he came back from the service, he was injured as the jeep that they were in when over a landmine, killed his buddies and injured him.\nSpeaker 3: He came to the hospital, needed a transfusion, a transfusion. And because he didn't screen then, he was infected by the virus and didn't show up until later and until they figured out that he had hepatitis C and just a few years after he was diagnosed with with liver cancer.\nSpeaker 3: And my grandfather would be here today and my grandfather was like my father, he was the guy and man showed me how to be a man. He was a very honorable person. He grew up in Barton, lived in Barnum.\nSpeaker 3: And if it were not for if it weren't for this disease, he'd be here. He'd get to see his great granddaughter and get a you know, perhaps maybe it stopped in at my campaign celebration when I was elected or when I walked across the stage at the University of Colorado to get my diploma.\nSpeaker 3: Folks who were infected with Hep C and folks who are at risk need to have access to the resources, need to have access to education. We need to spread the word because like my grandfather, there are other people's grandfathers and other people's dads and mothers and daughters and brothers and sisters.\nSpeaker 3: This is this does not discriminate. If we do not be careful, we don't pass the word around, it's going to be somebody else's grandfather or father or mother that's not going to be in the crowd when you get your diploma.\nSpeaker 3: Right. So it is is a. Very seriously. I'm very happy to have sponsored this proclamation every year so that we can raise awareness about it. The Hep C connection has done a great job of getting the word out and more people to the clinic and more people to get tested.\nSpeaker 3: It's best to know your status is absolutely preventable. And so, Madam President, with no doubt belaboring the the point in the moment, I just wanted to thank folks for this proclamation and urge my colleagues to support it.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Leavitt.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. Councilman Lopez, I want to thank you for sponsoring this proclamation not just once, but every year, because after about the fifth or sixth year of you sponsoring this proclamation, I thought to myself, well, I was born between 1945 and 1965, and I've spent a bunch of time overseas, and I wonder if I've ever\nSpeaker 3: been screened for hepatitis C. So I went to my doctor and I said, if I have been screened for hepatitis C and my doctor said, no. I said, Can I see? Yeah. It's just part of ordinary blood work.\nSpeaker 3: Got screened for hepatitis C and I don't have it. But nonetheless, I could have had it and I was in the risk group and so I don't have it. I'm happier for it. And if I did have it, I wouldn't have shown any symptoms.\nSpeaker 3: But it could have been a big problem down the road. So thank you for doing this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Leavitt. And I just want to mention that the news about the cure for this is very exciting and glad to hear that and all the progress that they're making on this disease. I see no other comments.\nSpeaker 2: So, Madam Secretary, roll call Lopez.\nSpeaker 4: Hi, Montero. I never.\nSpeaker 1: I Ortega. I Rob. Shepherd. Brooks. High fat.\nSpeaker 4: Hi, Herndon. I can eat.\nSpeaker 1: I lemon. Hi, Madam President. Hi.\nSpeaker 2: Councilwoman. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary. Close a voting not so. Results 12 eyes. 12 eyes. The proclamation is adopted. Is there somebody you'd like to come up to? The bring up to the podium?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, Madam President, I'd like to invite Nancy Steinfort, the executive director of the AFC Connection to the podium and whoever else I should introduce the folks who are here from the AFC connection as well.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. I am honored to once again speak to City Council about the importance of hepatitis C testing, especially among baby boomers. I'm also grateful to Councilman Lopez for being our champion and to the council members who co-sponsored today's bill, voted for it, and then were also able to include information in their e-newsletter about testing\nSpeaker 1: day. We tested approximately 40 people at the web building. In addition to that, I had conversations with at least five people. Two of homes. Husband had just finished treatment within the last couple of months and successfully cleared it.\nSpeaker 1: Someone else who had done treatment prior last year or so cleared it. And two other folks that are waiting for that opportunity and so still living with that virus. I'm hoping that our other ten testing partners have the same great results that we did.\nSpeaker 1: That would be 400 people. I'd be I'd be really happy. Last year was our highest number of testing years. We tested 592 people. As you might imagine, baby boomers are kind of, I don't know, stubborn and don't feel that this necessarily applies to them.\nSpeaker 1: So when you're trying to twist arms, it does get a little challenging. This group you most like most likely have heard that the latest treatment for HCV has a really hefty price tag. Even so, the cure rate is 90% and those results are amazing.\nSpeaker 1: We know that new treatments are going to be approved. Well, all right. I don't have a crystal ball with the FDA, but we think that they're going to be approved in November of this year and those results are going to be even better.\nSpeaker 1: We also hope that the price will come down a bit so that they can give some competition, too, to the current drug maker. As baby boomers age, it will become more difficult to treat them because of the to the of the damage to their liver over decades of undiagnosed disease.\nSpeaker 1: That's why there's urgency and more and more initiatives. In fact, Governor Hickenlooper signed legislation today that strongly encourages medical providers to test boomers for the virus. Thank you very much for working with us to increase awareness about hepatitis C through this resolution and for facilitating our testing in the web building.\nSpeaker 1: And now I'd like to ask Dr. Sarah Rowan to update us on her testing results at the Eastside Clinic.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Madam Chair. So I'm a physician at Denver Health. I work at the Eastside Clinic and Five Points Eastside is predominantly lower income and higher percentage African-American than the majority of Denver. We're funded through the CDC to do hepatitis C testing and linkage to care at Eastside.\nSpeaker 4: And we focus on the baby boomer cohort. We had a successful first year of our grant activities, so we expanded our grant activities to Parkhill Clinic, which has a similar demographic. In a year and a half, we tested over 2000 baby boomers.\nSpeaker 4: That's people born between 1945 and 1965 for hepatitis C, and 8% of the people that we tested had newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis C. It's a much higher percentage than almost anything else that we screened for in primary care except for possibly diabetes.\nSpeaker 4: Of those we screened, 171 people were newly diagnosed with chronic hep C. Most none of them knew that they had Hep C, 159 people had a post-test counseling session, and that's important for alcohol cessation counseling, for review of other vaccines to see if people need hepatitis A and B, vaccines and other healthy living tips for living with\nSpeaker 4: hepatitis C, we also refer people.\nSpeaker 1: To their primary care.\nSpeaker 4: Provider to get an evaluation for a.\nSpeaker 1: Cold liver disease.\nSpeaker 4: And after that, the primary care provider can refer them to a Hep C treatment specialist. So none of this is possible if you don't know that you have hep C treatments been limited because Hep C treatment's very expensive right now.\nSpeaker 4: But as Nancy said, it's really promising. So we're very excited about the future for Hep C treatment. I think that concludes my responses or my remarks. I would also mention that of the 171 people at East Side in Park Hill Clinic who are newly diagnosed, it was a majority African-American, majority low income.\nSpeaker 4: So this is a disease that disproportionately affects certain subgroups within Denver and I think gives us even more reason to focus on it. So thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. And thank you, Councilman Lopez, for that proclamation. We have a second proclamation this evening, and I would like to call upon Councilwoman Lehman to read proclamation number 424.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: 11 Eyes. Council Resolution 22, dash 201 has been adopted. Madam Secretary, please put the next item up on our screens. Councilmember Flynn, go ahead with your comments on resolution 159, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President. I don't want anybody up here on the dais to faint when I say that I am going to vote yes on a contract that includes red light cameras that do not work because they also contain the renewal of our photo radar speeding van program, which I think is essential for safety in our neighborhoods\nSpeaker 4: . I think it's disappointing that the agencies have combined the two because, well, just last week we were in a meeting with Dotti and some people from Harvey Park about improvements on Yale Avenue between federal between Irving and Sheridan.\nSpeaker 4: And one of the members of the public remarked that the traffic signals along there, the other three at Irving, Lowell and Raleigh, there seem to be more red light running at the one in Lowell. And so I noted for everybody present that that's because the yellow time at the one on.\nSpeaker 0: Lowell.\nSpeaker 4: Is inconsistent with the other two. That's why you don't see red light running at the other two as much as you do at the one at Raleigh. So I think it's disappointing that the city agencies seem intent on perpetuating red light running when we know there's a way to effectively eliminate all but intentional and distracted driving cases\nSpeaker 4: of red light running, leaving in place dangerous situations where we've identified intersections with a high level of red light running, leaving in place the traffic engineering shortcoming that induces red light running, which is necessary to make red light cameras profitable.\nSpeaker 4: I think borderlines on on negligence when there are accidents. We know. For instance, in California, where the state legislature adopted requirements for cities that use cameras to follow a certain formula for setting the yellow change interval, the timing of the yellow light.\nSpeaker 4: We know that cities up and down the state have removed their cameras because they no longer had significant red light running. And I mentioned when we when we postponed these contracts about a year or so ago, the case of Loma Linda, California, where one intersection averaged about 250 violations a month, that one approach on one of their\nSpeaker 4: streets and Loma Linda, 250 a month. And when they added a little bit of yellow time to the two, the traffic signal violations went down to six per month. And as I said a year ago, how many folks would like to stand at an intersection in Denver and not see anything but one violation every five days at\nSpeaker 4: a at a red light? But the agencies seem intent on on combining and packaging the red light cameras with the what I believe is the the positive nature of this contract, which is the photo radar speeding than we are needlessly fining drivers who are caught in our own engineering deficiencies that we are refusing to adequately fix.\nSpeaker 4: Since 2008, when this program started, all four of our camera intersections better enforced. And I think this is this is one of the reasons I'm voting for it, by the way, because this new contract will allow us to remove the cameras from those locations and move them around.\nSpeaker 4: But they've been at the same four locations ever since 2008. And all of those are on corridors that serve our underserved and marginalized neighborhoods. Three of the four primarily impact commuters from the West Side, including my district. When they come in on Sixth Avenue and go up Lincoln and they return home on Eighth Avenue through Speer.\nSpeaker 4: Three times a day, commuters from my area who work downtown go through these. And then the last one, the fourth one is up in on Northeast Park Hill and Central Park, borderline on Quebec, also both with all these locations.\nSpeaker 4: Affecting those neighborhoods. But otherwise, people who might live in southeast Denver or South Denver or central Denver, they might not even know we have red light cameras in them because they don't have the opportunity to go through them.\nSpeaker 4: When you look at the data that was provided to me by the department, police department. There has been since we instituted this program. There's been a 92% increase in red light running through violations from 2014 through last year.\nSpeaker 4: 92%. The data on accidents is also on crashes is also very ambivalent because there's such a short dataset from before we started the program in 2008. There's very little data just two or three years, and you can see that the number of T-Bone accidents from year to year might be the same as they were before the red\nSpeaker 4: light cameras went in. I think it's an abject failure when we know. From the California experience. That setting the yellow time properly and appropriately for the traffic conditions virtually eliminates red light running. As I said, the only saving grace is that will be able to, for me in this contract is that we'll be able to finally move\nSpeaker 4: them from sixth in Kalamazoo and from eighth and Speer and sixth and Lincoln and 36 and Quebec and put to put them in some other parts of town for a change. Instead of draining the wallets of drivers who otherwise are driving safely but are caught in our engineering shortcomings.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Flynn.

All right, let's move into committee reports of the city council. Will the clerk please read agenda item one into the record?\nSpeaker 1: Agenda Item one Council Bill 1197 97.1 Banning extending for six months the moratorium established by ordinance 1 to 5 764 and extended by Ordinance 20 6006 on the filing, acceptance, processing and or approval for any application to capture a new principal or accessory you or change a principal or accessory use for any site.\nSpeaker 0: Currently used.\nSpeaker 1: As a mobile home park, as defined in section 23.84 8.20 32 on this code.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Before I open the public hearing on this item, I'm going to turn it over to council members to want who as lead sponsor of the bill, may want to provide us with some introductory remarks. And then if Councilmember Warrens would also like to provide some introductory remarks, she will have an opportunity to do so as\nSpeaker 0: well as members want. The floor is yours.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, President Gonzalez. This council will extend the temporary zoning restrictions that protect the residents of Seattle's remaining mobile home parks from displacement. One and a half years ago, the residents of the Halcyon Mobile Home Park not to have them contact the city council because their park owner at the time.\nSpeaker 2: There's a new owner. No. Was attempting to sell it to a developer. And when mobile home parks are eliminated, it can be absolutely devastating for the residents. The residents own their mobile manufactured homes, but despite the name, they are often unable to be moved.\nSpeaker 2: So when the land is redeveloped, everyone often loses everything. People are left with mortgages to manufactured homes that they can no longer keep and have nowhere to go. This was particularly dangerous as an outcome potential outcome for the residents of the Halcyon Mobile Home Park, who are seniors who have paid their dues to the community work for\nSpeaker 2: decades, and many of whom have been former union members. My office worked with the residents to develop and bus temporary zoning protections to prevent mobile home parks from being redeveloped into anything different. And through their excellent community organizing, we were able to pass that legislation, and councilmembers who were there the last few years will remember that they\nSpeaker 2: are moving public testimony. Councilors passed temporary zoning restrictions and requested that the city departments do the work required to make those or other zoning protections permanent. Unfortunately, Mayor Dawkins departments have not prioritized so far that protecting the homes of the residents of Seattle's mobile home parks and really no progress has been made on the zoning work.\nSpeaker 2: So we will need a council bill for the temporary extension, which the residents have correctly requested. I thank contemporaries for co-sponsoring this. I hope the Council will pass this six month extension day and I again request Mayor Durkan to agree to have the Seattle Department of Construction inspections of the Department of.\nSpeaker 2: Learning and community development. Do the CPR work necessary to make these protections permanent? Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember, and the want for bringing this bill forward together with councilmember suarez and for those opening remarks. I understand that councilmember suarez and you coordinated in advance and you were taking the lead on making remarks. So we will go ahead and move on now to the public hearing portion of today's agenda.\nSpeaker 0: So as Presiding Officer, I am now opening the public hearing on Council Bill 119797 extending the moratorium established by Ordinance 125764 on the filing, acceptance, processing and or approval of any application to establish a new principal or accessory use or change a principal or accessory use for any site currently used as a mobile home park.\nSpeaker 0: There are currently at least two mobile home parks located in the city of Seattle. The first is the housing mobile home park and the second is the Bellerby mobile home park. The online registration to sign up to speak at this hearing opened at 12 noon today, and I will call on speakers in the order of pre-registration.\nSpeaker 0: The online registration will remain open until the conclusion of this public hearing. The rules apply to the public comment period also apply to those public hearings at which Speaker will be provided 2 minutes and will receive a 10/2 warning to wrap up their comments.\nSpeaker 0: Speakers microphones will be automatically muted at the end of the allotted two minute public comment period. Public comment relating to Council Bill 119797 is only being accepted at this public hearing. Speakers are asked to begin their comments by stating their name.\nSpeaker 0: And without further ado. We'll go ahead and begin the process of. Accepting public comment on this particular council bill. We only have three people signed up at this point for public comment. The first is Linda McCoy and then we will hear from Dominique Chandler.\nSpeaker 0: Linda.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, I'm Linda McCoy, and I'm the current president of the homeowner's association here at Health Yard. And I just want to say that we learned very, very late, like just yesterday evening, how this worked. So several people have sent emails to you about this.\nSpeaker 1: So if you have a chance to read them, please do. Patti Zetland is one and Sharon Brown is another. She wanted me to mention that. So thank you. Councilmember suarez and councilmember someone for putting this forward and for helping us get through.\nSpeaker 1: Two things happened that made it difficult for us to move forward on getting the things done for the. Reason or permanent. Where and when we changed the board of directors here. So we had to kind of start over with a new group.\nSpeaker 1: And then of course, COVID 19 happened. So because of that, we really weren't able to to move forward with use or intention is to request that you pass this extra extension. And then in the next six months that we work with you in the mayor's office and the city department to get the reports done that need to\nSpeaker 1: be done in order to move this into a permanent zoning mobile only. Okay. I guess that's it. I am I.\nSpeaker 0: You got about 4 seconds. You got about 4 seconds.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, well, vote yes. I don't know what else to say. Thank you, Linda. We've worked on this for a year and a half, so. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Linda, for calling in and for your continued work and advocacy on this. Our next speaker is Dominique Chandler. Dominique. Is Dominic Chandler on the line?\nSpeaker 3: Hello.\nSpeaker 0: Hello. Now we can hear you. There you go.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you, Del Monte Chandler. And yes, I live in Halcyon Park. And let me tell you, the last hour has been. Oh, so tragic to hear everyone's sadness. And that's not the reason for this phone call. But my God, everyone is suffering now.\nSpeaker 3: And all I want to say.\nSpeaker 1: Is help him park.\nSpeaker 3: It's a senior park.\nSpeaker 1: And he now the choice we've got is we bought our homes. It's only one really left here that we're homeowners of ours, you know, mobile unit. And if they kick us out or just, you know.\nSpeaker 3: Level it.\nSpeaker 1: We have no place to go. There are a lot of people that will add to the homeless.\nSpeaker 3: Population.\nSpeaker 1: Because we're seniors. And come on, you guys, don't you have senior parents? Don't you have people that love you and that, you know.\nSpeaker 3: There's a time that.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, taking care of your elders should be.\nSpeaker 3: A good thing.\nSpeaker 1: Not a bad day. And I. My hearts being broke. With everything going on, as all of yours are. And that's about what I need to say.\nSpeaker 3: That let's hope tomorrow is better than the weekend. All right.\nSpeaker 0: And and thank you, Dominique, for calling in. We appreciate you taking the time to do it. We have Stuart Duckworth listed on this public hearing list. I know we heard from him during the general comment period. But if Stuart is still on the line, we'll be happy to hear from him.\nSpeaker 3: Well, hello again. Yes, I'm still on the line. And I agree with Dominique about all the other people that have talked. This is an amazing situation that we have out there. However, I'm here just to support the extension of the mobile home park, and actually we should make it permanent because this has always been a mobile home\nSpeaker 3: park and they try to develop put development in here because it's a fairly large piece of property, but it is built on a garbage dump in the late fifties or middle fifties, and underneath the garbage dump is the water from hell or lake.\nSpeaker 3: So this is really unstable ground and a mobile home park is basically all that it's really good for or manufactured home parks. We have homes, we have a couple of those in here, too. So we just need to get a vote to.\nSpeaker 3: Make this a permanent mobile seniors mobile home park. Thank you very much. And. Have a great rest of your day.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Stuart, for calling in today. That concludes the public commenters that I have formally signed up for today here. So we will go ahead and close out the public hearing on a council bill 119797. And we will now proceed with a vote on the bill.\nSpeaker 0: So I will move to pass Council Bill 119797. Is there a second? I thank you so much, because there was a lot. I thought I saw your lips move, but I didn't hear anything, so I wanted to have a little pause there.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmembers want again as lead sponsor of the bill. I'd like to go ahead and recognize you in order for you to address this item in further detail.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, President Gonzales. I don't plan to have any more points. I think the points that we made are also by the residents themselves about why it's important that we maintain their housing and that. And as they highlighted, they are our senior members of our society and we should absolutely be prioritizing, protecting their housing.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Council Member So what? Are there any other comments on the bill? City Councilmember Peterson, followed by Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Strauss. Councilmember Peterson, you're recognized, please.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I wanted to thank the residents who called in today and also to thank Councilmember Sharon and Councilmember Arias for their leadership on this. It's this is a great example of preserving affordable housing that we already have, preventing homelessness.\nSpeaker 3: So I just want to thank them for their leadership on this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. We will now hear from Councilman Mosqueda and then Councilmember Strauss. Thank you, Madam President. Just a quick question for the sponsors, if I might. Given the delay in the initial plan to have a more concrete strategy, can you talk a little bit more if it's appropriate, Madam President, if it's appropriate for the sponsors\nSpeaker 0: to do so? Can you talk a little bit more about what your hope is at the end of the six months? And I know we want folks to work with us to see that. Are there concrete plans that we think will come to fruition at the end of these six months?\nSpeaker 0: Who wants to take that? Does that council member so want or Juarez want to take.\nSpeaker 1: Back.\nSpeaker 0: Something worse?\nSpeaker 1: Madam Chair. Thank you. Councilmember Mosqueda. As you know, we've been working on this for health promotion and I, when councilor was drafted, was here as well. And the short answer is yes. We would like to see what success looks like is a legislative fix.\nSpeaker 1: That is that we join with CCI and we actually carve out a particular zoned area for these manufactured mobile home parks. I think a lot of people think these are just mobile homes, that these are actually manufactured homes with a concrete foundation where people have lived there for many, many, many years.\nSpeaker 1: And as council members who want shared, we have a lot of elders, retirees, we have a lot of we just have a older generation living there. We've been there at least three times and have met with the different leadership at both areas.\nSpeaker 1: And so the endgame is that we carve out some legislation that we make it permanent. And we looked at other zoning and how other cities did, it appears, the home county, Thurston County, and I believe the city of bias, if I'm correct.\nSpeaker 1: So that's that's what success should look like, hopefully. So thank you for that question.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Council member, council members wanted. You want to respond to that as well? Okay. We'll do that. And then we'll hear from Councilmember Strauss because mercyone.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. As I mentioned here, there are other cities that have created that permanent mobile home park zoning designation. And so there's nothing new or strange or difficult about this. But Seattle does not happen to have that zoning type so far.\nSpeaker 2: So in order to make that happen and to make that zoning board permanent, the department would need to carry out a CPI analysis, which is a state Environmental Protection Act analysis. Again, this should be fairly routine work. But for whatever reason that, you know, the mayor's office should be answerable to, they have not carried that out.\nSpeaker 2: But if they did carry that out, which they should be doing, because we cannot indefinitely be extending the temporary. Designation, they should carry that out. And once they do that, the council can pass a similar bill. But that designation would be permanent, and not just for six months only.\nSpeaker 2: And so, I mean, in terms of controlling mosquitoes. QUESTION Concretely, I think it comes down to the city council members. You know, joining me in putting pressure on the mayor, do not postpone this any longer and just do this, because as far as I understand from a technical standpoint, there are no obstacles to getting this analysis out\nSpeaker 2: so that we can make the zoning designation permanent.\nSpeaker 0: And I thought that clarification would be helpful as we think about what happens at the end of six months. So thank you both to the prime sponsors and happy to support today.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember Strauss Yeah, thank you. Council President Thank you, council members for sponsoring this bill. It is something that I would like to engage with you on for a permanent fix for six months is up because we know that a permanent piece of legislation will stop us from having to renew every six months.\nSpeaker 3: My grandmother lived in a manufactured home park for seniors, and I understand that. I understand that the ground that you keep your home on is not necessarily the ground that you own. And it's important for us to be able to provide this affordable housing and ensure that it remains stable.\nSpeaker 3: So I'd love to work with you on making this permanent fix. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Strauss. Any other comments or questions from my colleagues? I'm not seeing any. I think I share the same interest as many of you. I think it might be the third or fourth time I'm being asked to vote, a third time that we're being asked to vote on this issue.\nSpeaker 0: You know, it would be really nice to be able to just have the substance and the actual legwork done and completed by the executive so that we can move on from this issue. It is really frustrating that that has not happened.\nSpeaker 0: So. So hopefully we will be able to encourage the mayor's office and and and the SDC to actually just do the CPA and allow for us to have some level of certainty as it relates to this particular issue.\nSpeaker 0: So. Looking forward to ongoing leadership from Councilmember Juarez and so on in that space and of course from our land use chair. Councilmember Strauss. To be able to figure out what the path forward is to facilitate the execution of the work that needs to happen.\nSpeaker 0: So I definitely plan to support this bill. Okay. Looks like folks don't have any more questions or comments. I do want to offer the sponsors an opportunity to close out the conversation if they have anything else that they'd like to add.\nSpeaker 0: It was like, all right, looks like nothing else to add here. So I would ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 1: Morales. I must get.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Peterson.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 1: So what.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: Strauss.\nSpeaker 3: I.\nSpeaker 1: Juarez. I. Herbal. I. Lewis.\nSpeaker 3: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: President Gonzalez, I. Nine in favor. None opposed.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent. The bill passes and the chair will sign it.

Council Member Can each go ahead with your comments, please? On Council Bill 21, Dash 1291.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council President This is a little bill, but it has a very big story behind it. And it's historic because it is actually creating the first dedicated revenue stream or the fund to receive a dedicated revenue stream for transportation and mobility in our city.\nSpeaker 3: You know, in the in the day, we thought that transportation funding came from the federal government, maybe from the state. But increasingly, as we know, unfortunately, many of these obligations have been eroded at the federal and state level and they have left it to us at the local level to meet the needs.\nSpeaker 3: And we also now understand we need more than just roads. Right. We heard a lot of testimony tonight about the need for multi-modal safety infrastructure that supports those who roll, those who walk, as well as those who drive.\nSpeaker 3: And so we are doing something tonight that was the product of a lot of collaboration. In particular, my colleagues, Councilwoman Black and Councilman Clark, were in long conversations with the administration trying to be collaborative partners and thinking about how we could be transformational in mobility.\nSpeaker 3: So this fund will gather an estimated $9 million or so in its first year. That's not quite transformational at the at the outset, but we have now a a first, which is saying that a stream of funding coming into the city will be dedicated on its way out for mobility and safety.\nSpeaker 3: And so that's why it's important. And it's then upon all of us, again, to continue to collaborate, to make sure that we grow that fund. So the source for this fund is parking revenue, and it's not all the parking revenue in the city, it's just the increment.\nSpeaker 3: It's the new amount that we're adding. We need to maintain the general funding. We need to maintain all the things that the city does every day. But the increment will be dedicated to this and we need to keep thinking about what are other ways we can grow our mobility investment to be able to make a dent in\nSpeaker 3: the safety and the efficiency of our city. So I again, just want to thank the administration in particular. We went through several leaders of Dottie during the time that's the Department of Transportation Infrastructure with you, several directors at the time that the conversation started.\nSpeaker 3: Till today, we have the support of the Budget Management Office figuring this out and moving a little bit from a a long held position that that they had to evolve and understand the benefits to the city of taking this step.\nSpeaker 3: And, you know, all of the frontline staff who helped to estimate figure it out. And I think, you know, overall, while I called out several of my colleagues who were kind of in the in the discussions with the administration, I think overall, this body in year after year has prioritized mobility spending in our budget agendas.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that overall council support helped to make this winnable by knowing how important it was to this body. So it's a it's a little step but a big day and I'm pretty excited about it. So, you know, I we're already in the consent agenda.\nSpeaker 3: I don't have to urge anyone to vote.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, but I'm really excited. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Canete. Next up, we've got Councilmember Hines.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, council president. And thank you, Councilmember Kennedy, for your comments. We all deserve the freedom to get from A to B safely, no matter how we choose to get there. And that's a value statement that I've said many times as a candidate and as an elected official.\nSpeaker 8: I've tried to live my value whenever possible, including using my car as little as possible for most of the time. In COVID, I sold my car and had no car and was able still to get around and do all the essential things that that I needed.\nSpeaker 8: So this is a move in the right direction. There are certainly other creative ways that we can think that are more transformative. I've mentioned to Dori many times, so this isn't a surprise for them. But another thing that we could consider is redesigning our transportation budget for the mode of transportation and we want people to take as\nSpeaker 8: opposed to the transit mode that people take now. So that's what Oakland does. And there are certainly other. For us to be transformative and Vision Zero is going in the wrong direction. And and I disagree that we should extend the timeline past to 2030.\nSpeaker 8: In fact, I think that any loss of life is is preventable. So thank you. Thank you, counselor. President.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember. Sorry about that. And thank you, Councilmember Hines, and happy to support this this evening. Appreciate the comments on it. Madam Secretary, we're going to go ahead and move to the next item that's been called out for comments.\n",

The the chair recognizes counsel. Board counsel. You have the floor.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you so much, Mr. President. And may I also add Counselor Bryan Morales, an original co-sponsor of this.\nSpeaker 0: Counsel, were also ordered. So our.\nSpeaker 4: Great. Wonderful. So the bipartisan infrastructure law folks have heard about it. It provides an immense amount of funding for infrastructure across the country, but a lot of it is determined by competitive grants. And so it's really important that the city of Boston be an applicant and a strong and competitive applicant for as many of grant those grants\nSpeaker 4: as possible in order to get millions and millions of dollars directed towards high priority things in the city across a lot of different categories of infrastructure. Potential areas include road, rail and transit, port infrastructure, busses and bus facilities, vision zero, plan implementation, pedestrian safety, charging and fueling.\nSpeaker 4: Infrastructure low and zero emission school busses. We like reconnecting communities that are divided by highways, flood mitigation assistance, brownfields, remediation, energy efficiency and conservation energy specifically, and schools energy resilience code adoption which relates to Berto and the stretch code out of the state.\nSpeaker 4: Cybersecurity Smart Grid supports waste and groundwater storage. So just like a huge carrot set of categories of things and there's kind of a dizzying array of notices of funding availability that are coming out of the federal government on a kind of complicated time schedule.\nSpeaker 4: And a bunch of these opportunities have to be applied for by our state like various departments, and the city might be partnering with them, or some are what the person who's eligible is actually the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, but a bunch of the grants, the relevant applicant is the city of Boston.\nSpeaker 4: And so this notice is really just to, um, to stress the fact that we want to make sure that we, the city are applying for every one of these that we can and that the Council should be informed about what those applications are, the ones that we've made, the ones that we plan to make.\nSpeaker 4: And if we're not applying for any of these opportunities, I really want to make sure that we all understand is it because we really don't qualify? We have good reason to think we wouldn't be competitive. You know, there's huge opportunity here for us to really advanced our Complete Streets initiative.\nSpeaker 4: Recharge Boston, our Vision Zero Action Plan. The Imagined Boston 2030 plan. Go Boston 2030. There's just a lot of things that we have been dreaming of for some time, and I would say we're probably one of the better positioned municipalities in the country in terms of the amount of that kind of planning that we've done, but we're\nSpeaker 4: not planning to actually turn into implementation. And so I'm super grateful to Christopher Robin Milliken, who is one of our fellows this summer, who did a in-depth dove for my office on all of these application opportunities. And we also talked to the administration.\nSpeaker 4: And so there's some reference in the in the hearing order to some of the applications that they have already put in, including this 9.3 million one for the clean school bus program that they put in in July, and an $100 million one for national infrastructure project assistance.\nSpeaker 4: But there's, for instance, the safe streets and roads for all. Grant is coming up in September and then a whole bunch more that have that have no fees that are due to come out in the third quarter of 2022.\nSpeaker 4: So it's such a robust are doing a great job for us, chasing down all of the potential opportunities. And we feel like it's very important for the residents of Boston to know that we're on top of this and for the council to have a voice in it and for us to start getting ready for opportunities where we\nSpeaker 4: might get significant federal funding. So it feels to me like a very important part of our recovery, Mr. President, and thrilled to be co-sponsoring this with the council overall today.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Counsel. Walk the chair recognizes council. We're all council world. You have the floor.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, President Flynn. And thank you to Councilor Black for leading on this. The bipartisan infrastructure law is an opportunity to provide real investments in climate change, reduce and prevent pollution, create lasting environmental change, improve the air quality and quality of life in our city through improving infrastructure.\nSpeaker 3: Vision zero Boston Action Plan and imagine Boston 2030 to directly address community interests around traffic, calming measures, improvement, transit and walkability, and reconnect to communities. It is a grant that can advance our city initiative, provide solutions to community community concerns.\nSpeaker 3: An opportunity like this has a potential to have major impact on our neighborhoods and, by extension, residents. Neighborhoods like Dorchester, Mattapan and Rock. Roxbury has suffered because of lack of infrastructure in the past, with Dorchester, Dorchester having some of the highest temperatures to date.\nSpeaker 3: As a result, how are we centering environmental justice, communities and concerns in this conversation? How are we prioritizing those most impacted by a lack of infrastructure investment? And how are we ensuring that input makes implementation of these grants are distributed equitably?\nSpeaker 3: I'm excited to engage with questions like these and ensure that communities that have been overlooked can be heard and represented. I'm looking forward to collaborating with the council, our state and congressional colleagues and all involved departments and engaging our community in this process.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, counsel. Overall, the chair recognizes counsel to counsel. Carter, you have the full.\nSpeaker 6: The President. Flynn And just to indulge me for just for a quick moment, I forgot to recognize the North Shore Community College public speaking course led by old left Sherry Rafferty. She's a Boston resident. I was going to tell her to provide a grade for me in my public speaking, so hopefully she will watch this in the\nSpeaker 6: future and I want to thank them for being here. But I just wanted to thank the baker for this and to please add my name in always for your due diligence. Ensuring the city of Boston is doing what it needs to do to get the most out of these funds to transform and protect the public realm.\nSpeaker 6: We find ourselves yet again with a once in a generation transformative opportunity. And I found myself in conversation with many advocates discussing our waterfront. No are no shock and no surprise in saying out loud that I expect the city of Boston to be competitive when going after this money because we desperately need it.\nSpeaker 6: There is a special earmark in this federal package that will make our infrastructure resilient against the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. This legislation is the largest investment in resilience of physical and natural systems in American history, in American history.\nSpeaker 6: And so Councilor Bach eloquently stated in in her order that due to the short term and competitive manner of these opportunities, we must act with urgency. I echo that and just to summarize my own take on this, I encourage all of us to do what we can to go get this money because we need it.\nSpeaker 6: So I look forward to hearing from the administration and better understanding what grants they will apply for and how it will promote our city's goals for a more green and resilient future ahead. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Counsel. Clara, the chair recognizes counsel Brett and counsel Brett. And you have the floor.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to the makers for bringing this very important issue to light. I think it's critically important that we use and use every all of our resources to try and maximize the benefits of these these infrastructure grants.\nSpeaker 6: As councilor collectors already mentioned, this is a once in a generational opportunity. And, you know, in our conversations with some departments over the past few years, one issue that came up was just the the support and infrastructure within our within our administration, within government relations, etc., to really execute a timely application for these grants.\nSpeaker 6: So it's really important that we ensure that the departments have the support necessary to be successful in these competitive applications. And I hope that we can have a robust conversation and support all of our departments to every in every way so that they can take advantage of this opportunity.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Counsel Right in the chair, from the chair to council. Just a quick question. Is there a central location where we find out about competitive grants or or what is the process of cities and states finding out about competitive competitive grants that they must apply for?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. So I think that's part of the challenge here is that the different grant opportunities were sort of assigned to the different executive offices in D.C. and then those are responsible for putting out these no photos. So in the notices of funding availability.\nSpeaker 4: And so I think basically what's happened is like, you know, our Transportation Department is sort of tracking the ones from the Department of Transportation federally and, you know, and like and then once they're from the EPA, our environment department would be tracking.\nSpeaker 4: But, um, but that's part of the reason to really make sure that the city is both keeping a unified list and that it's kind of like that there's wide availability and knowledge, but that is for the council. So I know that I think that the and folks have been trying to keep such a list, but I think\nSpeaker 4: it's something that should be shared with the council. And, you know, and like I mentioned to Christopher Robin in my office has done a great job of digging out all the deadlines and what hasn't been issued yet. But there is a slightly crazy aspect to this where you sometimes just have to like wait for the no votes\nSpeaker 4: to drop and then suddenly they will have all these detailed regulations and also a deadline that's like not very far away. So to councilor grade in this point, it becomes very important for the departments to be nimble and ready and able to throw some personnel time into getting those applications in.\nSpeaker 4: And it really can be the difference. You know, I mean, we when you think about how big I mentioned the school bus one, it's 9.3. The I think the we put in an April for a raise one for Roxbury that would be 25 million if we got that one of these the mega ones, 100.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, these.\nSpeaker 6: Are.\nSpeaker 4: These are things where it makes sense for us to be like ready to go on a dime. But it is a little bit of a crazy decentralized process federally.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, counselor. Walk with anyone else, so to speak, on this matter. But anyone like to add their name? Please raise your hand. Mr. Clarke, please add Councilor Baker, please add Councilor. Royal Councilor Braden Council Aquatic Council Fernandez Innocent Council.\nSpeaker 0: Florida Council.

National Teen Dating, Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month is an effort to raise awareness about abuse in teen relationships and promote programs that prevent it during the month of February. Unfortunately, dating violence among teens is more common than most people know, according to a recent all national recent national survey.\nSpeaker 10: One in ten teens reported being hit or physically hurt, hurt by purpose or hurt on purpose by a boyfriend or girlfriend once in the last 12 months. In addition, one in four teenagers have been in a relationship where a partner is verbally abusive.\nSpeaker 10: By supporting the National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, that's that's a mouthful. We as a city can bring awareness to the issue on a local level and demonstrate our commitment to fostering and supporting a healthier community for all.\nSpeaker 10: And we're going to hear during public comment from Candi Lewis, executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. Ms.. Lewis will share with us what her organization is doing to help address teen teen dating violence and how we can support their efforts.\nSpeaker 10: And with that, I'll move to move the item.\nSpeaker 1: It's a motion in a second, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think it's really important we make sure that we're talking about teen dating violence, both traditional and also via social media and other formats. It's really important. Our teens are certainly the future, and we want to make sure that, you know, that this council is very supportive of of\nSpeaker 2: what you're doing. And hopefully, if you are going through anything, you can seek support. But I look forward to hearing from the public and hearing a little bit more about about this issue. But let's stay on this. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Any public comment on the item? Seeing nonmembers, please cast your votes. I didn't see over there.\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 1: Let's let's let that lady make a few comments.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Richardson and the esteemed council members. My name is Candy Lewis, and I am the executive director of the Positive Results Corporation. We are a nonprofit, and our mission is to address teen dating violence and sexual assault in youth and communities of color.\nSpeaker 4: Teen dating violence is an epidemic. And the numbers that you've heard are just reported. The reported numbers are dismal, but the actual numbers are even worse right now. 90 every 90 seconds, a girl in the United States is assaulted.\nSpeaker 4: But that's only reported. That's a girl this over 12 years old. And so we're not really showing those correct numbers, according to our surveys that we have personally done in the last five years. We've had over 2200 people that we've surveyed.\nSpeaker 4: 37% were African-American. 43% were Latino, Latina, 9% white, 5% Asian, 33%. Pacific Islander, two Middle Eastern, 2%. Middle Eastern. 48% of youth and young adults have experienced sexual assault, dating and domestic violence by the sixth grade. 60.3% of youth and young adults report being hit, slapped, grabbed, pinch, spit, act, and over 60% didn't realize that they could\nSpeaker 4: be in a dating and domestic violence relationship. Teen dating violence looks like physical assault, verbal abuse, emotional mental, physical stalking and of course, cyber. And we thank you very much for bringing this to your to the city's attention.\nSpeaker 4: It is a national resolution. And because of your support, we'll be able to bring local work, a local commitment here into the city of Long Beach. There's a lot of work that's already being done, but it's not nearly enough because all of our children are impacted.\nSpeaker 4: Violence and abuse actually starts in the womb, and if we do not address it, we are going to have a worse problem. Right now, the numbers are 36% of every pregnant woman is physically assaulted. 36%. If we were to turn around and look at the audience and ask them, how many of you have experienced teen dating violence\nSpeaker 4: , domestic violence or sexual assault? I'm sure almost everyone would be because every one of us is impacted by it. If it's not in our family, it is in our neighbors, it's in our children. And so I thank you very much for bringing this to light.\nSpeaker 4: We do have additional information that we will be happy to share with you. I also have something for you all. I brought our brochure that talks about the work that we do. We not only address teen dating violence and sexual assault, but we also address bullying healthy relationships.\nSpeaker 4: Because if we do not talk about healthy relationships, we won't be talking about any relationships as well. And our organization has been partner with all state foundation to eliminate teen dating violence and sexual assault. And so I have a little something for everyone.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, ma'am. Time to time is up. If you can just leave the stuff for for the clerk. That's for you. Thank you very.\nSpeaker 4: Much. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Any other public comment on this item? Okay.

And not my item are item 11, which are my nominations to the Commission on Persons with Disabilities. And I am happy to report that I have three impressive nominees and I just want to give shout out my appreciation to our community.\nSpeaker 0: I am just overwhelmed by the amount, the quality, the quantity and quality of applications. I'm getting to all of our boards and commissions. These decisions aren't easy. I'm really touched by people's commitment. They just desire to serve their community, to lend their time and talents.\nSpeaker 0: So what I'm doing, my recommendations are that we reappoint two of the incumbents and then appoint a new individual. And so whenever incumbents is Lisa Hall Lisa has a wide range of experience with disability issues, including from a personal basis, from working with a parent.\nSpeaker 0: She has done a lot of work with our less privileged individuals for many years, found Christ Episcopal Church as food bank program and does work with our Rantoul community and she has served a term on the commission with persons in just with a commission on persons with disabilities would like to serve in others.\nSpeaker 0: She is one of my nominees and the next nominee is us. And this is in no particular order. It's in the order in which they were interviewed. Jennifer Rohloff is another incumbent and Jennifer has a brother. Her younger brother has special needs, lives in a group home in the area.\nSpeaker 0: But Jennifer, from a young age, in part because of her commitment, in part because her mother was a teacher in the school district, she was actually called upon and agreed to be a tutor in special ed classes when she was in elementary school.\nSpeaker 0: She remembers tutoring in Neil Tam's special ed class, and Mr. Tam is a revered educator. Then the late Neil Tam, his friends and family are still in the that community, but he was a special ed teacher before he became a principal.\nSpeaker 0: Jennifer has served on the board of class in house, which trains and provides employees with special needs folks that serve you at Safeway and other other establishments. And she's said she is a very passionate advocate for persons with disabilities.\nSpeaker 0: And then my third and newbie appointee is named Katie Beeler. And Katie is well, I'll just give you a little, little background. She actually applied to serve on the library board, but I was so, so taken with the description she put in her her application that I reached out and said, would you possibly consider serving on the\nSpeaker 0: Commission of Persons with Disabilities? Arranged for her to meet with Sarah Henry, our public information officer, who also staffs that commission. And so she's Katie Bieler, who works in the publishing industry. In particular, she is project manager on global literacy and education for a company, an independent publishers group, where she oversees publications for persons with reading challenges\nSpeaker 0: , whether they're visually impaired, have dyslexia, ADHD. And she says that after 15 years in the publishing industry, my passion for equitable access to information led me to my current role, where I create software products for people with print reading disabilities.\nSpeaker 0: She's currently the president of the Bay Area Women in Publishing. She also has a master's degree in Jewish art and in visual culture from the. Jewish Theological Seminary of America, as well as bachelor's degree in History of Art from University of Michigan and another and another bachelor's degree in anthropology from University of Michigan.\nSpeaker 0: And she's excited to join this commission. So that's just an introduction. At our next meeting, we'll have a chance to vote on their nominations, but I just wanted to introduce them to you. Thank you, all of you, everyone who applied and those who were nominated.\nSpeaker 0: And we look forward to voting on your nominations next week. So thank you very much.

Unimportant city matters, as are. The vaccination process is moving forward, including with most of us on city council.

As city council members and elected officials, this recommendation is not meant to put any city employees, any of our legislative staff or staff in that matter, or the public at risk.\nSpeaker 2: The council meetings are currently being conducted with the limited number of city staff in the council chambers, as is while also observing safety protocols.

These protocols can be implemented in a way that would allow our body or mayor council to also be president one location as\nSpeaker 2: we conduct our city business. There are other cities as well as the state legislature in Congress. I think that we can look to to provide some models as to how this can take place. And I'm actually pleased to have see some additional steps being taken over the past few days that would actually help provide additional transparency for\nSpeaker 2: council meetings beyond the current model. I want to thank you, Mr. Mayor and Tom, for thinking and working to provide video access to the public. I do believe that this will be a step in the right direction. But I also want this this item to move forward as Long Beach and our region continue to move forward with\nSpeaker 2: vaccinations and reducing the spread and risk of COVID 19. We should be engaged in discussions as to how we should, and we are engaged in discussions on how we are open in our schools, our workforce and our economy.\nSpeaker 2: And as we're having those discussions, we should also be considering how we can safely begin to reopen and reengage with transparency in our city government. And I believe we need to plan accordingly. And this is more written in a way, in requesting the city manager to give us a plan and, of course, move it forward so that\nSpeaker 2: we don't. So we have some some direction. I look forward to the discussion this evening on the item and our request council support.\nSpeaker 3: Is there is there a second on the motion? Second buy comes from mango. Comes from a mango.\nSpeaker 1: No, thank you. I want to thank Councilmember Austin for bringing this item forward. I know that on some committees we're able to see each other, but the public can't see us. I think that there's a lot of transparency that comes with the ability to see one another.\nSpeaker 1: I was at my field office today in the park and many residents very far apart popped by and said hello and are feeling very protected by their vaccine. And I know that not all of our city staff have been able to get that vaccine yet.\nSpeaker 1: However, I'm sure that the city manager can come up with a way for all of our employees to be safe and for there to be additional transparency. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilor Marie Ringo.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. It's have a couple of questions and then a couple of comments. Where are we right now in the tears? Are we still in the purple way for days? Yes. L.A. County, of which Long Beach is tiered for for those types of openings, is still in the purple tier.\nSpeaker 2: Is there any expectation there will be going to be a Renteria offensive? Potentially. We've been tracking the trends for the county and if it continues on the same downward trend, we could reach the seven 400,000 case limit. You know, the next probably week or two weeks and then there's a two week process to two opens later in\nSpeaker 2: March, potentially we could be in the red. And where are we in regards to scheduling or vaccination? So that we were able to early on identify a number of employees as emergency workers. That was a very difficult exercise.\nSpeaker 2: You know, we want to get all of our employees vaccinated. We were hoping to do all 6000 right up front, but clearly there was not enough vaccine to do that. We went through a prioritization process and looked at employees that were emergency responders and also ones that were really dedicated to COVID efforts and were able to get\nSpeaker 2: a number of them done. Over the past week or two, we were seeing a lot more vaccine coming out. We're also getting the ability now to classify more as emergency workers. And we do believe the state is also going to starting expanding some of those near those categories, hopefully in the next week or so, so that we\nSpeaker 2: can begin to do more. So right now, I would say more than half of our employees do not have access to the vaccine. I would just give you some examples about probably most of the department directors that attend meetings are not vaccinated.\nSpeaker 2: Some are, but a lot are not, and some of their support staff are not as well. So we still have a ways to go before we can have, you know, all of our staff able to be vaccinated. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Is there any requirement since this is a change to some work in the working environment of our employees? Zero requirement for us to get our unions to the challenges of find this meeting for or whatever we have to do, meet and confer.\nSpeaker 2: Anytime we're changing working conditions, we look at each one individually. Some of the staff who operate know this. You know, the council chambers, you know, have been operating the council chambers, but obviously in a teleconference format and not a full format.\nSpeaker 2: So we do need to talk about any major changes with our unions. I would make that determination and then sit down and do some meeting. Okay. So I'll read you correctly that we have not had a discussion of of it.\nSpeaker 2: We have not done any meeting. Confer on this now. Okay. Well, if we are not fully vaccinated, we have not had a beautiful immunity, so I can't stay away. So I would if I can, I would like to make such a motion to go to a video call to that topic until that time when we can.\nSpeaker 2: We're going to talk face to face with it.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Think just just to be clear, so contrary to so I think you are second to the motion to just do the video. Is that what you said exactly?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Is there a second on that motion? Vice Mayor Richardson That's the second version. Richardson of Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 2: Thanks, Mr. Mayor. And, you know, I think we can. I want to start off just asking staff just how would you go back to the original motion? Because I don't want to dismiss the sentiment here. I think the sentiment here is that you want to get back we want to get back to in-person meetings because of the\nSpeaker 2: value that that it brings. And I think the readiness that I have is that I think that should be guided by both health and logistical health guidance, logistical guidance. And so I want to ask more specifically to our city manager, what would be the logistical or health concerns with returning within 30 days, the in-person meeting?\nSpeaker 2: So we've been taking a look at this. There are a number of things we would have to do to be able to resume in-person meetings or new video. It is it is easier to turn on video using the current WebEx system if we just use the exact same system that we're all using now, we're able to then\nSpeaker 2: turn on that video if we bring back the council in-house. We would need to do a couple of things. We'd have to run a video system of the cameras in the chamber so that everyone can see that. And that takes certain staffing.\nSpeaker 2: We would then need to have a call in line as well for city staff, because we would have to have a number of staff still who aren't vaccinated and are comfortable coming in, be able to call in and then have the public line as well to make sure that they have that.\nSpeaker 2: So that does take some technological support. We also want to make sure that all of the council have, you know, for the video option, have the access to a good, strong Internet connection and have that tool that you need.\nSpeaker 2: Often it's easier to do video and not audio and not just video. And so that's something we got to work on as well. And then as raised and we got a note from our unions today that I think you want to confer and discuss some of this.\nSpeaker 2: We would need to do that as well. Great. Thank you. So I would say I think the sentiment the sentiment is right. I think two things would need to happen. I would just ask Councilman Granger that the fact that he's n but I think, you know, we're part time, our staff is full time.\nSpeaker 2: You know, Congress, state legislature, L.A. City, they're all full time. The dynamics are completely different. So to go back to in-person meetings, I think we would need to actually talk with you. We definitely need to do that. So I would say, can we include one for staff to begin that conversation?\nSpeaker 2: Because we don't want that to delay the process once we get to the place of reopening. I think secondly, as it relates to the video, I think that's again, something we can do now. I think that's what the substitute motion is.\nSpeaker 2: I think the video we can do, we can do that. I was ready to do that already. I think we do that now. But the in-person meetings, we need to figure out those logistical issues and we need to to make comparison to things.\nSpeaker 2: I would ask you them compare and then give us a to run for on what considerations need to be factored in in order to pull the trigger. So is it is it certainty? Is it vaccination details? Is it, you know, how we're going to handle public comment, all of those things, putting the two front four.\nSpeaker 2: So we do we have a better picture of this. And so those will be the two additions that I would offer to Councilman Rankin.\nSpeaker 3: Read Manga.\nSpeaker 2: Was that a political question? That's a that's a friendly one to meet and confer and to to do a true form for on what needs to happen. Yep. Well, I guess I wasn't clear. My line of questioning was obviously that we need we need to step back to maybe we need to have a meeting with the unions\nSpeaker 2: and we need to work out the logistics of of the meetings. And until those are addressed and I feel safe and our staff feel safe and go to in-person meetings. But if if going to a TFF is essential to clarify this paper, I certainly support that.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So that's the motion in the second on the floor. Let me move on to the next next speaker councilman's in the House.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, Mayor. Like Councilmember and Vice Mayor Richardson said. I think that the original motion, you know, I do agree with the sentiment. I think we're all ready and willing and eager to to go back to our city chambers and conduct our meetings.\nSpeaker 1: I think a year has exhausted all of us. But I think that we need to do that with all the safety measures in place. And right now, I don't think it's safe. I also think it's very important, since our staff would be with us, that they also are vaccinated.\nSpeaker 1: If we're asking them to come back. So I am supportive of the step motion. I know I've been pushing for video for several months now and so I'm glad that we are looking into that right now. I know that also one of the things that I've been advocating for is easier access to public comments.\nSpeaker 1: I know that it's it's easier for residents who are more tech savvy to be able to access public comment. But I know that even in my district, even the most tech savvy residents, that I have also had difficulties.\nSpeaker 1: So I look forward to being able to explore that option of being able to have easier access to public safety. And I know that I'm working right now with city clerk to figure out easier ways of being able to bring about easier access to our public comments.\nSpeaker 1: Because I do think that it's very important that we are on video and that we are seen through video. But I also think it's equally as important that we hear from our constituents and that we give them the opportunity to be able to do a public comment if they so do wish to do so.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm I'm excited that we're moving forward and hopefully one day we will soon. And I do see that as the end of the time. And then the tunnel, the light at the end of the tunnel, I do see that light.\nSpeaker 1: So hopefully we will be in our city chambers soon. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Allen.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to say, I certainly understand the activity and the technical issues that we all experience, especially the public, and that that can be frustrating. And I certainly can't wait for things to get back to normal and get back in the chambers and have being a newly elected councilwoman that I'm just excited\nSpeaker 1: to be in front of that community and just to have that face to face time with my colleagues. But I just don't believe that the time is right. I think that, you know, we have been offered counsel. Folks have been offered to be vaccinated.\nSpeaker 1: But our support team and I don't believe the city clerk's office has been vaccinated yet either. And. And I also agree that it's important that we hear from our from our labor unions and how this could impact their membership.\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, I did receive a letter today from Richard Chavez from A.I.M., and this is one thing he said in this letter. He said. He said, We believe that bringing folks back without any science to support the safety of this action is wrong.\nSpeaker 1: And we believe that an item like this requires a robust conversation. We cannot and will not allow our members lives to be gambled with. And I certainly and I know I know I can imagine anyone who wants to gamble with any of anyone's lives.\nSpeaker 1: And we definitely want to to see, you know, the staff vaccinated before we open up the chambers to the public. So I can totally support the substitute motion. And and I look forward to getting on video.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman Zorro.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. I, too, also support the substitute motion, because I think that first and foremost, the safety of all staff, especially members of, you know, of our union as well, are taking into consideration when not only the council member asks, but there's so much more that takes to run a council meeting that we have to consider\nSpeaker 1: and that I believe it's important and I want to uplift what council members and they have said about making sure we continue to put public commenting process that's accessible and is easy and not just technology wise but language wise as well in the forefront of everything we continue to do, whether it is the teleconference, the video and\nSpeaker 1: hopefully in the future in-person. So I again just believe that it continues. I support the video and that we need to make sure we have extensive conversation about about it before we go in-person. So thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. We have heard from the public comment yet, but I do want to just say that I do appreciate the sentimental considerations from most of my colleagues who we've heard speak already. I think there's been some some some misunderstanding in terms of intent.\nSpeaker 2: I want to just say that I knew that agenda izing this item would create an uncomfortable kind of conversation. But, you know, we all ran for office and any time we are before the public, even on the council dais, it's not a comfortable situation.\nSpeaker 2: And and so the intent behind city council meetings are not supposed to be be comfortable. We but we should be safe. That is something that I think we all agree on. I will claim some success on this item since we are moving toward being more transparent and more accountable.\nSpeaker 2: And that means video access to our meetings that that that is a I'm thrilled with the direction that we're moving in. And I think I mentioned that. And so the substitute motion I will support, but I would have supported that is a friendly.\nSpeaker 2: Had I been given the opportunity to do that and pointing I want to point to the to the Ms. Allan called it the AM Union. The the the meeting our process is is directed oftentimes by policy, directed by council and direction, by the city council.\nSpeaker 2: And so should we move forward, whatever we're moving forward, that that process is going to be what it is anyway. And so I think, you know, we do a pretty good job of engaging with our city representative employees unions.\nSpeaker 2: We should continue to do that, but moving forward with this process in any way. And so I'm going to support the substitute on the on the floor. I mean, I do not need to there's no reason for me to to die on the sword over having in-person city council meetings.\nSpeaker 2: But I do think we should be thinking about this. We should be planning for that in which we should be transparent with the public in terms of give it an expectation on what that looks like. We are moving forward.\nSpeaker 2: We are we are leading our our vaccine rollout. Many city employees already are vaccinated. And I don't you know, everyone has people privacy. And so no one knows exactly who has been vaccinated. But I do expect over the next few weeks, 3 to 4 weeks with the vaccine that we know we're we're supposed to be getting, we\nSpeaker 2: should be in very good shape within the next 30 to 45 days. And so hopefully we can revisit this conversation very soon.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. We have one member of the public for public comment.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Michelle Baker.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. My name is Michelle Baker and I'm a resident district two and a business owner District three. I agree with Councilmember Austin's comments to have a plan to return to in-person meetings. Most council members have been vaccinated and there's only three meetings per month.\nSpeaker 1: Although the public can't attend, in-person meetings should be video live streamed and public still should be able to provide comments even if you don't approve this item. It is imperative that city council video streams are meeting. Most other government entities have WebEx Zoom video meetings, including L.A. City Council and the Coastal Commission.\nSpeaker 1: Even the DNC held their convention on Zoom. I have reached out to the city clerk several times inquiring about video stream meetings or told them July. Yes, it's up to the mayor to decide. And it's ultimately the decision of the council as a whole, the whole of the WebEx video meeting.\nSpeaker 1: I don't understand why there is reluctance to hold video meetings and most other government entities have been doing them for months. Transparency is crucial and it's an open society and people need to know that their council members and mayor are listening to them.\nSpeaker 1: Video streaming ensures that the Long Beach community can see their representatives in action and see what's going on in the city. Thank you so much and hope to see you live too.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. Mayor. So I agree that we should proceed with the video access if we can, but I'm not clear because there was a lot of dialog. How long that will take for our city team to be able to make that technology work for all of us and for the public.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, and let me let me. That's a good question, actually, for for the clerk and Councilman Price, if you don't mind, we could ask the crowd and ask the same thing. Madam Carter, Della Garza, if you're if you're if you're available.\nSpeaker 3: I know that I know you've been working on this video kind of transition for a few weeks. And I know Mr. Modica had mentioned to me a couple of weeks that there were there were some some tie issues that you guys were trying to figure out with software.\nSpeaker 3: Can you maybe update the council on kind of where that's at? Because I know that your team's in working on that.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Thank you, Mayor and Council, we have been working on this for a few weeks and we were able to meet last week with tech and innovation on Friday and determined that there is a way to move forward using WebEx and showing the video.\nSpeaker 0: So we're fairly confident if we do some testing with the council and make sure that the Internet speed and the equipment is adequate, that we'll be able to do that going forward. And again, it's just a matter of when we can work with the council offices and determine if the equipment is sufficient and get this going.\nSpeaker 0: So we feel we feel really good that we can make this happen pretty quickly.\nSpeaker 3: And Madam Clerk, just to clarify also Councilman Price's question, I think what you had mentioned to me is that you think in the next meeting or two that you'll have everything kind of tested. And then whatever software that I think you guys were looking at buying or or you guys were looking at some kind of text back\nSpeaker 3: in back of the house piece that you needed to add is would be in place, is that correct?\nSpeaker 0: So there is a piece of equipment or some software that we're looking at for translation services that won't be ready within the next couple of weeks. However, that will not prevent us from moving forward showing WebEx video on screen.\nSpeaker 0: We we feel fairly confident in the next week or two we can get the equipment distributed to the council members and get it tested and verify that everybody's connection is sufficient. We should be able to do that. Absolutely.\nSpeaker 0: The soonest would be next week, but it might be the week after if we can't reach out to all the council members and get that situated.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Price. Giving back to you. Sorry. Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 1: So, Mr. Mayor, you you have my question answered, so I'm fine, thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, great. There's a motion. Any second members, please go ahead and cast votes. It's a substitute motion.\nSpeaker 0: District one.\nSpeaker 1: I.\nSpeaker 0: District two.

        "source": "Speaker 1: Report from Economic and Property Development recommendation to accept funds totaling 3.9 million funded by the Community Economic Adjustment assistance for reductions in defense industry employment and execute a contract with blue drop performance learning in the amount of 2.5 million to develop web based platform materials citywide.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman, actually, let me turn this over for our staff report. We have a quick report from.\nSpeaker 10: Nick Schulz, executive director of the Workforce Investment Board. Good evening, Honorable Mayor Garcia, members of council. The item before you is the acceptance of an award from the Department of Defense Office of Economic Assistance under the Defense Industry Adjustment Program and is related to the impending closure of the Boeing facility in Long Beach due to elimination in\nSpeaker 10: the C-17 weapons system. Air support for communities, in fact impacted by factory closures and laid off employees focuses on developing adjustment and implementation strategies. Our local adjustment strategies focus on regional job creation through business development and expansion, workforce development and community economic diversification.\nSpeaker 10: Pacific Gateway aggressively pursued this program because we understood the uniqueness of the defense industry can create obstacles for communities affected by defense downsizing because firms and workers develop specialized skills and competencies designed to serve designed to serve government and military customers.\nSpeaker 10: They are challenged when trying to enter new markets and new sectors. Second, we know we must plan for the long haul and assume that we will not immediately be able to replace all the lost defense jobs. Replacing those jobs or adding new jobs in the communities is a long term proposition, and it is unlikely that a single\nSpeaker 10: new employer will ever absorb the entire impact. Instead, we are focused on developing strategies that support multiple economic drivers to replace lost defense jobs. When faced with downsizing, large defense contractors opt to remain focused on defense and government business, while in contrast, many smaller firms in the supply chain have interest in pursuing new markets or diversification opportunities\nSpeaker 10: . We want to help local firms assess their competitive assets and challenges and design appropriate strategies for new business development by focusing on strong partnerships and a commitment to change as critical success factors. We believe we can ensure a successful community transition occurs.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you and I'd be happy to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item seen on Councilman Richardson?\nSpeaker 3: Just want to take a moment and again, say congratulations. This is yet a second week of of great work represented on our agenda from our workforce organization. And I look forward to seeing the cumulative totals when we review our federal legislation by the numbers, because I have a I have a I'm going to guess that we're we're\nSpeaker 3: we're we're going to be well ahead of where we were last year in terms of our performance and in receiving federal support. So congratulations and great work.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman. Mango. I'm sorry. My apologies. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. And I'd also just like to say congratulations. I think this is this is good news, as good as it can get with considering that we are we're dealing with a plant closure. I can remember when the career transition center was was developed originally to deal with major reductions in force with the job losses associated with\nSpeaker 8: the McDonnell Douglas and Boeing back in the nineties. And this is this is bittersweet. So I think this is good. I'm a little kind of curious because I know that most of the workforce that that has will be leaving or that has left the the plant there.\nSpeaker 8: Many of those are 20 plus year employees and curious what type of retraining they will have as through through this service. Do you have any specifics on that? Mr..\nSpeaker 10: So actually, this is very different than anything we've brought forward to you before. This actually doesn't fund retraining specifically as Department of Labor will pay for that training. And we do have a national emergency grant to fund specific skill development for laid off Boeing workers in the pipeline.\nSpeaker 10: What the OJ grant does is actually allow us to build infrastructure that extends our reach out. So professional employees, those folks are sometimes hesitant to walk into a center like we operate, or those folks who actually have the skills to navigate the career pathway and access specific services on their own.\nSpeaker 10: This platform will actually extend our whole suite of services, as well as take the training courses offered by our partner providers, the ones that they can afford through online access. This will actually make those trainings available to folks without ever having to walk into our center or into a classroom.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Schulz. And I'm not sure if you mentioned how we we identified this fund or these funds.\nSpeaker 10: So actually, the Office of Economic Adjustment had actually worked with Long Beach as a community before when the Navy was in town. It is not a competitive solicitation like many of the things we move forward. It's specifically for a community that loses a prime defense contractor similar to the BRAC process you would see when a base would\nSpeaker 10: close.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 1: I want to thank our our team again for doing such a great job on this. Many of my colleagues joined me last night at the grand opening of Mercedes in the old MD. Facility. And as we transition the supply chain of the region, it is great for our city to be a leader in this, and it would\nSpeaker 1: not be possible without the great work. Thank you to the city manager and the Workforce Development Team. Nick, you have been a beacon of light for this city since you've started. We just cannot say enough about the great work that you've done and the number of new jobs that are going to be in the pipeline.\nSpeaker 1: So look for another council agenda item coming soon that will help our Long Beach residents get these these best and brightest jobs. We were already out there meeting. I met with a couple of VP of the companies within the last week, and I can't wait to bring that on board.\nSpeaker 1: And I know that with Nick's help, it'll be a successful project. So thank you all.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Ringo.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you very much. I also want to give kudos to staff for bringing this forward. I do have a couple of questions in regards to the length of this funding. Is it a one year, two year project one?\nSpeaker 9: How long it's going to go.\nSpeaker 10: Current amount you will be approving runs through September of 2016. Based on the progress in the deliverables of the plan, we have the opportunity to continue to find relevant, relevant projects through.\nSpeaker 9: And what would some of those delivery deliverables include, such as.\nSpeaker 10: Deliverables are in three categories. First categories economic development and planning that include that includes a data collection and analysis of existing industries. It includes and industry cluster mapping as well as public engagement around the economic drivers and growth opportunities for the Long Beach community.\nSpeaker 10: The second part of the grant revolves around land use and infrastructure planning. This is with regard to long time, long term use or transition of the facility. So there's a financial feasibility analysis involved with that land use and infrastructure planning as well as a C-17 transitional master plan.\nSpeaker 10: And that would be developed based on opportunities that that are shown to have promise out of the economic analysis that's conducted. And then the third piece of the plan that we've talked about in Councilmember Austin's questions is the assistance to impacted defense firms and workers.\nSpeaker 10: And that's there's. The C-17 defense and dislocated worker platform, as well as direct assistance to C-17 supply chain firms.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, that that third component was one that has most interest for me in the sense that do we have some kind of background on these employees as to a level of experience, education, ability to transition to other jobs in the in the not only in that in their own industry, but transition to jobs locally within within their\nSpeaker 9: own labor market here. And also perhaps even and we will have many opportunities within the city of Long Beach with perhaps some positions within the city itself.\nSpeaker 10: So fortunately, Boeing's complied with all their notice requirements under the WARN Act. We do have both positioned and positioned in number in each position and job descriptions related to almost 1600 folks impacted by the final closure. We're able to do some talent mapping with that.\nSpeaker 10: Look at the knowledge, skills and abilities of those folks coming out of the coming out of the Boeing closure and then map that over to existing opportunities in the labor force. And if there is not a consistent or highly predictive match for them to gain reemployment quickly to take a look at training opportunities that we have available\nSpeaker 10: locally that would help to close the skill gap and get them reemployed.\nSpeaker 9: Finally, in regards to the last part you spoke about, in terms of the mapping, the opportunities for retooling, retraining obviously is important. Are they going to be connected somehow with our OPI programs or lobby City College should they want to continue their education or enhance whatever it is they have?\nSpeaker 10: Again, there's we can have more of that discussion when we bring forward the specific request for for to accept the training dollars related to the laid off worker. Again, those will be federal workforce investment dollars that assist in that regard.\nSpeaker 10: So we are. Mandated to use what they call the employment training provider list. It's a state sourced list. You have to pass the standards set by the Bureau of Post Post-Secondary and Private Education, and you have to meet performance to continue to be on that list.\nSpeaker 10: Local rope programs, local Long Beach City College programs, CSU ALB PA programs, as well as private proprietary programs appear on that list.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Any public comment on the item?\nSpeaker 2: Very good, Kirk, as he addressed this is an interesting fund. I've never I never have gotten inside of it. But I'm wondering, in all seriousness, whether or not. This fund or a fund like it from the federal government might be used.\nSpeaker 2: To take the aircraft facilities. And. Make that, as I suggested a couple times before of it using. That our new City Hall complex period. We could put nine floors there especially. Certainly that building is more than ample to handle on one floor.\nSpeaker 2: What we have here are nine floors. And other city offices. Let's examine the possibility. See whether or not those funds exist. The case could be made that this is also as a result of employment. Industry is city wide in the in due to the reduction of military service and so forth or of military equipment or demand, therefore\nSpeaker 2: . So let's take a look at that if that money is there.

Hens, piglets, roosters and bees and animals we should have. It just struck me as being absolutely insane to devote that much time. And that was just the tip of the iceberg, apparently, if you've had marathon discussions like that before on that subject.\nSpeaker 7: But to me, that was just inane, considering the problems we face in terms of crumbling infrastructure, budget shortages. The crime, the reduction, the reduced police force, notwithstanding the good efforts they do. It just amazing to me. Absolutely no sense whatsoever.\nSpeaker 7: And I hope we don't have any further discussions on that subject. And more to the point. Where? To the point?

        "source": "Speaker 1: Introduction of ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code by deleting Section 20 5-2.4 concerning the accrual of sick leave by certain part time employees.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members. My name is Monica Alvarez Celis, and I'm an analyst in Human Resources Office. I'm here tonight to speak to you about amending the municipal code, in particular, Section 25, Dash 2.4, that references the part time sick leave due to the implementation of AB 1522, commonly referenced as the Healthy Workplace Healthy\nSpeaker 2: Families Act of 2014. Our current municipal code is in violation of the requirements enforced under the new paid sick leave law. Allow me to direct you to the chart posted on page two of my report where a comparison is provided describing the key differences between our current MUNI code and AB 1522.\nSpeaker 2: Under the new paid sick leave law, its requirement that we allow our part time employees to accrue a maximum of 24 hours of leave or a three day equivalent. They would accrue leave based on actual hours, worked at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked.\nSpeaker 2: Our current existing municipal code provides a five day equivalent based on the average hours worked for the year. Total hours worked. Only certain part time employees are eligible. And that we are eligible to receive the sick leave 12 months after their one year anniversary date.\nSpeaker 2: The hours are not accrued but frontloaded at the at their date of eligibility. So as a staff member, it is the city's Human Resources Department recommendation that we implement the new requirements imposed by AB 1522 while simultaneously providing a more generous leave accrual, allowing a minimum of 28 hours of sick leave per calendar year by continuing to\nSpeaker 2: abide by the policies set by the current municipal code. The city is in violation of the paid sick leave law and potentially at risk for penalties. This concludes my report. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 5: So I have a question that I'm a little embarrassed to ask because I emailed and Michael Roche sent me a nice detailed answer and I still don't quite understand it. This is my question. Are you aware of it myself, Ellis?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. Okay. So that what I said is and that's a great table that was really helpful, but there is no reference in in the ordinance, deleting the ordinance. We're going to vote on that. Delete Section 25, dash 2.4 to the proposed administrative procedure provisions which exceed Assembly Bill 1522, specifically the 28 hours or equivalent five days and\nSpeaker 5: the one hour paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked or a front load of 28 hours at date of hire. So how if we're deleting the old ordinance that included that what takes its place so we make sure those provisions exist.\nSpeaker 2: We have drafted an administrative procedure that we have shared with the departments that have the high level of part time employees. And it's primarily it's all dependent on what's decided here at this current council meeting, whether or not we're deleting the muni code.\nSpeaker 2: So we'll have to go back in amended if we have any changes. But basically what we're doing is recommending that we go with the 28 day annual accrual based on their actual hours work rather than their average total hours worked as current under the muni code.\nSpeaker 5: And no, I understand all that. So then the administrative procedure that you reference that you're circulating among these departments. That's a good point. Not all departments would have a lot of part time work, recreation and parks probably does and some others.\nSpeaker 5: But. And is that administrative procedure something that is just approved at the executive level and doesn't come back to council?\nSpeaker 2: That's correct. Staff makes a recommendation. We send it up to administration for approval and then we implement it.\nSpeaker 5: This time I understood. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Perfect.\nSpeaker 6: And a mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Member ready.\nSpeaker 4: To move. Introduction of an ordinance amending the Aluminum Municipal Code by deleting section 20 5.2.4 concerning the accrual of sick leave by certain part time employees.\nSpeaker 0: Second comment member asked.\nSpeaker 5: Quick question, I guess I do have one more so on page two. The regarding the proposed administrative procedure leave accrual, how will it be determined whether sick leave is accrued one hour per every three days, worked or frontloaded 28 hours at date of hire?\nSpeaker 5: Did you just answer that?\nSpeaker 2: I did not. Okay. Our plan, our recommendation to the city administration is that anyone who is hired as a part timer on a variable schedule, that they are set up for a one hour accrual for every 30 hours worked.\nSpeaker 2: The front loading should only be made available to those who are seasonal and are all primarily in the park and RECs department because they are only eligible to work for a maximum of six months. And so we wanted to be able to provide them with the sick leave benefit sooner rather than later.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you very much. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Although some favor I. Opposed. Motion carries unanimously. Thank you. Thank you. And now we have. City Manager Communications.\n",

For whom? And Toyoda Mike Conaway will walk us through it.\nSpeaker 8: Mayor Garcia, members of the city council, this item brings forward the first sales tax incentive agreement from the Department of Economic and Property Development. Human Toyota, formerly Beech. Toyota intends to relocate its car sales operations from 4401 Pacific Coast Highway to 3399 Willow Street at Redondo Avenue, human to Saudi, intends to significantly expand and renovate the new\nSpeaker 8: site at a cost of $4.2 million, not including acquisition cost. Beach Toyota, which human acquired in 2008, enjoyed a sales tax incentive agreement that was originally entered into in 1996 and which expired in September 2013. Mr. Nathani requested that the expired sales tax sharing agreement be renewed and the sales tax basis of that agreement was $135,000, above\nSpeaker 8: which sales tax revenues were shared equally. To facilitate discussion, Mr. Nathani agreed to double the sales tax base to $270,000 and requesting to equally share sales tax revenue above that amount until the earlier of reimbursement of the $4.2 million renovation costs for 15 years.\nSpeaker 8: Kizer Marsden reviewed the request and concluded that based on prior sales and conservative projections or the 15 year period, the facility should generate nearly $12 million in local sales tax to the city, of which approximately 4 million will be shared, with whom Toyota and approximately 8 million will be retained by the city.\nSpeaker 8: This amount is nearly 4 million more than the sales tax base staff believes. The sales tax incentive agreement is a persuasive economic development tool and is widely used by other cities. Staff recommends that City Council authorize the proposed sales tax incentive agreement and Mr. Human Assadi is in the audience this evening and is available to respond to\nSpeaker 8: counsel if requested. And additionally, I'm available to answer your questions.\nSpeaker 4: May.\nSpeaker 5: Move.\nSpeaker 3: Again. Okay. There's been a motion and a second. Councilmember Price, I mean Councilmember Mongo.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. This is going to be the first of many sales tax agreements that are going to come before this council. I'm really excited that we're going to attack increasing our sales base here in Long Beach so that we can afford the important things that we need streets, sidewalks, trees, public safety and all of those things cost\nSpeaker 10: money. And to do that, we need Long Beach residents to purchase their cars, purchase their groceries, purchase their gas inside the city limits of Long Beach. We're really proud that Hooman has chosen to stay in Long Beach. We know there are a lot of potential areas he could have moved to and we are thankful to have you\nSpeaker 10: as a partner and we look forward to doing more deals like this in the future. So bring us some more business. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Scott Trumbo.\nSpeaker 1: O'DONNELL Yes, thank you. And I just want to congratulate Mr. Herrmann. He's a good man. He does well for our city. He's a volume dealer. That means he sells a lot of cars and that tax comes back, back into our coffers and pays for our streets, sidewalks, libraries, etc..\nSpeaker 1: And I thank him for his commitment to our city. You just mentioned it. He could have gone to a number of other cities, but he chose to stay in Long Beach, cost him a little bit of money to do it, and it took him a couple of years to do it.\nSpeaker 1: Not not on the fault of the city, just in tact on matters with regard to how dealerships are located. But he was very committed to moving inside the city limits of Long Beach, and we look forward to more good stuff from him.\nSpeaker 1: So thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilor Andrews? Yes?\nSpeaker 2: It's Mr. Herman here. I'd like to congratulate him, but I've never seen him before. Oh, you don't have to sit that far in the back, young man. Okay. Congratulations.

And there is a report in here that I'm sure we'll talk about later, but it was developed by John GROSS and Mike Conway.\nSpeaker 7: And they do talk about the importance of the city of Long Beach, focusing on three premier areas of sales and one of those is auto sales for new vehicles. So this is really a great thing for us to continue to incentivize and work with businesses to bring in this particular industry to the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 7: And I want to thank staff for their report, and I think it ties in with this agenda item.

And I know a lot of us have heard a lot about the 90813 and that it is upwards of 19% unemployment. And it's sad.

And I also want to thank my council members, my cup, my council member colleagues for including me in this motion, because I think it's more important that we have local agreements that are in line with project labor.\nSpeaker 11: Agreements mean that's how we get to be successful. And so I'm fully supportive of this and I'm looking forward to working again with our community groups and with the faith based groups. Faith based groups. Got a little list there.\nSpeaker 11: Some fun to work on this. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman Monk.\nSpeaker 4: I just wanted to make sure that this includes all types of jobs in the community, not just our labor jobs, but all of our local businesses. The benefit to a community where local hire is prevailing is not just in having your local residents have jobs, but also in the reduction of the commute for the whole region, the\nSpeaker 4: reduction of pollution for the whole region. So I just want to make sure that we look at incentives also for our local businesses to hire local and what percentage of their payroll would be local.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. See no other comments. Is there any public comment on the item? Please come forward.\nSpeaker 9: Very good. Kirk has the address. I would suggest that if any outside were to look, follow this council meeting. And if you listen to the previous long three hour discussion on this other item and this, it would be positive proof that this is a dysfunctional organization where the left hand doesn't talk to the right hand.\nSpeaker 9: All of these have merit. This. This argues well for the fact that you jumped the gun. Because this could have it's actually this would mean more than just cleaning up. This could be an essential part of and should have been an essential part of Murray's right in.\nSpeaker 9: Without what you spent 3 hours talking about. I would suggest the left hand get to the right hand. And with all the money that this city is spending on communication, it would seem to me that you should start talking, communicating to each other.\nSpeaker 9: Let the left hand know what the right hand is doing. This has considerable merit, as does the other. There's no sense in horsing around and setting up two committees to commissions and wasting further time to do it. So I would suggest that we need some.\nSpeaker 9: Again, it goes to the issue. We need some better direction from the leadership of this city. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Next speaker.\nSpeaker 8: Good evening. Derek Simpson, again, executive director of Long Beach County Action Partnership. Though I've learned a lot in my life this last two months in this process has been quite the experience and education in terms of how we can do better about jobs in our community.\nSpeaker 8: And it's been because of, as the councilwoman said, the openness and the opportunity to sincerely share information in a way that we could make meaningful and sustainable decisions in our community. I want to thank you again for bringing this item to the agenda of the council tonight, because, as Mr. Richardson said, this is the juice.\nSpeaker 8: This is where I use the analogy as I was trying to understand how I could articulate it to you. I just recently bought a really, really nice camera and it does everything that I wanted to do, but I don't know how to make it do it.\nSpeaker 8: And I think that by reading my manual and understanding steps one through ten to get through any given process, it helps me get some absolutely wonderful pictures. I think in this case, with that play being a wonderful document, this indeed historic.\nSpeaker 8: This particular local hire policy will help us as a community understand how we get the results that it was intended to provide us as a community. So we really hope that we have that continued seat at the table to understand how this policy will help us understand better the play's implementation in our community and make the impact\nSpeaker 8: that it was intended to make. We want to ensure that each of you know that we're willing to share whatever information that we have and work with you to make this what it was intended to be. And thank you for bringing it this far with the support of your staff here at the city.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 14: Good evening, Alexander Hanham with the Legal Aid Foundation and the local hire coalition. In his recent State of the City address, Mayor Garcia encouraged businesses to invest in Long Beach and hire local residents. And with the play and with this agenda item, I think the council and the city have signaled that they're prepared to make that same\nSpeaker 14: investment. So we thank you for that and we're excited about that. We look forward to working with the Council to refine this policy to make sure that we can maximize that investment and the benefits to the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 14: Um. The local hiring policy can work if it's a three part policy, which includes a first class hiring program, local hiring policy for play construction and local hiring for non play construction. We're very excited about the possibility of a first source hiring program.\nSpeaker 14: Um, first source hiring can be a great way to, uh, give good jobs in certain sectors to local residents like the service industry. Like retail. Um. First force hiring cannot be used in conjunction with a play. Because unions are under legally binding agreements in the way that they hire for for a certain job.\nSpeaker 14: Um, if unions try to circumvent those agreements, then it can subject them to liability. They can violate their agreements. So it's important, in addition to the first source hiring, to have a play specific hiring policy to resolve the remaining questions that need to be answered to ensure that Long Beach residents get the maximum benefits from the play\nSpeaker 14: . Um, for example, the policy can spell out the requirements that a resident would need to, um, to qualify as a local resident or as a disadvantaged worker. Um, in addition, and more importantly, the policy can lay out the procedure that contractors must go through, um, to try to hire Long Beach workers before they open up jobs to\nSpeaker 14: residents of other cities. So before moving from Tier one to Tier two, what does a contractor have to show, have to demonstrate that they have done. Um, to try to fill those jobs that Long Beach residents. Um, it's our understanding that this policy will include a first class hiring program for non construction jobs as well as a\nSpeaker 14: program for play and non play construction jobs. Um, so we respectfully request clarification on that point. Um, but we're excited to work with the Council on this policy and we thank you for agenda item. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 9: Ernest Roberts again, I think it's great that you guys are looking into the jobs coordinator role in a in a policy. I think that's very important. I can tell you that as has in our work in Los Angeles, we probably put something like 1700 people into the trades, into the various construction trades, the L.A. County building trades\nSpeaker 9: and the Carpenters. Um, and the processes in the policy would have to be really clear. I understand that there's been some confusion about the first horse, first horse hire and construction trades, and the first are does not work with union contractors.\nSpeaker 9: So even if the project is at $500,000 a union contract, it will still not be able to pull somebody off of a list. They're still going to have to go to the trades and get a dispatch. There's a lot of detail in this thing, but I think I'm glad that you're looking at this and I encourage you\nSpeaker 9: to to use whatever expertize you can you can get your hands on. There's a lot of expertize here within our coalition and and in labor to help you figure this out. A clear process of how the trades are going to move, I mean, move to get people from these colleges.\nSpeaker 9: You know, the apprenticeship programs are training programs in and of themselves. They generally don't need a lot of apprenticeship training. But I do understand that that's what you guys are doing and that's fine, but at least have a clear process of how that's going to happen and that's what the policy will do or does.\nSpeaker 9: So there's two parts to the policy as we see it, because the first horse hire stuff and then there's the stuff that deals with the construction trades and how that process, how the outreach, how the how the, how the, the network of agencies is going to contribute to this to the to this pipeline, which is why the\nSpeaker 9: pastors got involved in the first place. It's not unusual for them to see a lot of their congregation with significant issues that need need help in this area. That's why they're here. So just make sure that it happens.\nSpeaker 9: Also, for purposes of transparency, it might not be such a bad idea to think about having somebody from the community, somebody as knowledgeable about this as one of that six member panel for the oversight for the for the project labor agreement that will give some transparency, give some assurance to the to the pastors and the rest of\nSpeaker 9: the community that this process is open and clear. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And I think our last speaker.\nSpeaker 4: Hello. Council Honorable Mayor Janine Pearce with Lane, Los Angeles Alliance for New Economy. I just want to applaud you guys for your vote earlier and applaud you for taking items. This item number 28, we would just like to to say that we encourage us to look at a robust jobs program to ensure that our plan is really\nSpeaker 4: successful. And we'd really like to see a pre apprenticeship program that has a proven track record used as a model for what we can custom make for Long Beach. We want to ensure that low income residents are prioritized, as you already have.\nSpeaker 4: And and, of course, veterans making sure we have a carve out for that. At Lane. We have a proven track record of working with organizations like the Hospitality Training Academy as well as L.A. Trade Tech. And we would definitely like to work with Pacific Gateway in trying to make sure that our pipeline in Long Beach is strengthened\nSpeaker 4: to make sure that building trades can be successful. And not just in those industries, but also in the tourism industry where we, you know, have raised standards there. But we need to make sure that we're getting local residents into those jobs.\nSpeaker 4: And so I just applaud you guys and look forward to working with you on this.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone, for coming in. We're going to turn this back to the council count tomorrow. Yes.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Thank you. You know, I think especially in my district, I think without a doubt, the residents in this district, you know, that need the programs like this to get a jumpstart. And that's the needed to in order for them to succeed.\nSpeaker 2: So, you know, this is absolutely one of the ways that we can create, I think, really great jobs and thank all the our culture people bringing this to the diocese. Thank you again.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Ringa.\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. I, too, want to thank staff applicants for. However, what I've heard a lot about tonight is the input from the community in regards to not only the play, but the stadium as well. And what I'd like to see it for.\nSpeaker 11: From here forward, the next 45 days, your staff can reach out to the ministers, your clients to lean to. I mean, they're getting older. It's like, okay, thank you. To reach out and include them in this discussion because I think it's very important that we be as inclusive and transparent as we possibly can in this process.\nSpeaker 11: So I would encourage staff to please reach out to these other community groups that are in the audience as well and include them in the discussion.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. We're going to go and go now to a vote. Obviously. Thank you to all the community that's been working on this. I know there's been a lot of a lot of meetings and hours and an interest.\nSpeaker 1: And I think just so that the community knows that things are important to note, that I think that we actually have a for us on the city side, we have an all star team on this. And I think we're all been very impressed with with Nick Shultz and his ability to do this.\nSpeaker 1: And I think he's very excited about the opportunity to bring something forward. And so we want to wish him and his whole team a lot of luck as we put this thing together. So with that is going to take a vote.\nSpeaker 0: Motion carries seven zero.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And now we're going to go ahead and go to 15.\n",

Last week, once again at our committee, Seattle Public Utilities joined us and talked about the work that they have been doing to protect Seattle's waterways. This is something that SPU has been working on for years now, and I really want to say thank you to all in Seattle public utilities that have been working\nSpeaker 5: on this. The city's federal consent decree for control of combined sewer overflows. That means both the wastewater that comes from our home and businesses, plus the overflow from our city streets and off our roofs. The federal government mandated that our overflows going into Puget Sound and into Lake Washington not exceed one site 1% per year.\nSpeaker 5: So we have entered into a consent decree with the federal government and we now have an opportunity for the city to delay the achievement of that standard in favor of what's called stormwater projects that have better water quality results.\nSpeaker 5: I'm really very impressed with the work that SPU is doing. And no rate increase are going to go beyond those that were identified in our strategic business plan. But it will result in the adoption of this Council bill that allows us to extend the time in terms of implementing the consent decree.\nSpeaker 5: So we earlier approved the plan at a conceptual level. We had discussions about this last year and then several times in my committee this year. The integrated plan is a significant policy choice is going to add $100 million of capital costs through 2030, and it will really boost our infrastructure work.\nSpeaker 5: The benefits of this plan are that we're going to have cleaner water faster. We're actually going to get more bang for the buck. We'll be spending more money, but we'll have a significantly higher water quality outcome. So our committee recommends moving forward with this and to adopt Council Bill 118378.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Questions or comments?

        "source": "Speaker 1: Thank you. Two more requests to move up items. Item number 19, please.\nSpeaker 0: Communication from Councilwoman Sara. Councilmember Your Honor, Vice Mayor Richardson. Recommendation to request City Manager to work with community stakeholders to create a vision and feasibility plan for a Cambodian American cultural center.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Farrow.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Vice Mayor, and I thank you as well as Councilmember Urunga, for signing on to this item. And I want to. Jim Whipsaw. Look, I'm sorry. I do not mean well among own, but Laconia. I couldn't join my own.\nSpeaker 0: So I just want to thank everyone for being here today who've written.\nSpeaker 2: Comments and emails of.\nSpeaker 0: Support, as well as.\nSpeaker 2: Making sure to be here.\nSpeaker 0: To speak in support of the item. As many of you already know, because we commemorate the Cambodian genocide every year that many have resettled here in the aftermath of the genocide, making Long Beach, the largest Cambodian population in the United States.\nSpeaker 0: And which is why I am so proud to bring forward this item, to make sure that we make this dream of so many Cambodian living in Long Beach, the beginning of a reality of creating a Cambodian American cultural center.\nSpeaker 0: And then, given how arts and culture was almost completely lost during the genocide. It's been so important to many of our Cambodian elders that arts, culture and history is not lost, but that it's not only celebrated and promoted, but preserved so that the next generation, such as myself, the Cambodian Americans, are able to also learn and understand\nSpeaker 0: as well as the broader community, learn and understand the arts and culture and language as well of the Khmer people. So I also want to add that the mayor supports this item as well, even though he couldn't be here today.\nSpeaker 0: So I spoke with him and that he was in support of this. So I wanted to make sure to share that and also want to make sure to share that. It's and you know, we just had such a rich culture of making sure to celebrate our diversity and the culture and adding into the many cultural centers here\nSpeaker 0: in Long Beach, and that we hope to add the Cambodian American Cultural Center to it. With that said, I love to open this for public comment. Thank you. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilmember Sara, we have I'll offer a few comments. We do have 18 people here, so I want to make sure we get to get to them. I just wanted to say I'm happy to support this. I think it's important.\nSpeaker 1: It can do a lot to enrich our cultural tapestry, the cultural center. We've taking steps on the African-American Cultural Center, the Latino Cultural Center, and I certainly believe the Cambodian American Cultural Center will be a tremendous addition to our city's cultural fabric.\nSpeaker 1: That said, let's go ahead and begin public comment here we have I'm going to call them up three at a time. And if you come up and line up because there's 18 people, if you can come up three at a time, that would be helpful.\nSpeaker 1: First is vital in this. And then next is Daniel Lu and Suzanna Sneed. Is it on? Going to they're going to help you lower the podium. Beautiful. Thank you. Malala. Okay. Thank you. Good evening, countrymen, and how the woman and wife honor honorable mayor.\nSpeaker 1: My name is David. Throughout the night in. My friend. Call me that. My parents and my father, all the survivors of the killing feel. I've been a long time resident of the state. I live in District one, all from I've been living in Long Beach over 30 years plus.\nSpeaker 1: Since then I have seen that Cambodian American have come a long way in a nine. We overcome a lot of racial violence and tension. And our neighborhood is now named Cambodian town. Honorable Mayor and member of the City Council.\nSpeaker 1: Now it is time to start a new chapter in our history. It has been a dream of for a number of years by many a Cambodian American. To have a cultural American culture center in a united state. We have 320,000 Cambodian.\nSpeaker 1: American. California have an estimate of 118,000. Yet outside of Cambodia, Long Beach have been over 20,000 lodges in the country in one city. I'll compare the American need at home for our identity and legacy so we can preserve for the next generation and educate other American about army music or band or our food.\nSpeaker 1: Ancestral artifact has partially. Our rich history of our global. I hope his vision. I don't know. 19 Campbell or American Culture Center come to realization with your support and with your hope. Thank you. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 1: Next is Daniel and after that is Suzanna. And after that is Christina Lee. Daniel. Hello. Hello. Hello, City Council. Thank you for sharing space in your presence today. My name is Daniel Loo and going public comment on behalf of Cambodia towns thrive based on our community vision plan, draft and community engagements.\nSpeaker 1: With over 200 plus community members, many expressed the need for youth educational spaces, outdoor, multicultural center and civic comments to meet the overarching guiding principles of creating healing restorative communities. Of these community priorities connected to creation of the Cambodian American Cultural Center.\nSpeaker 1: It provides a space for across racial and ethnic dialog, as well as intergenerational conversations that preserve not only Cambodian history and culture, but also the rich and rich history and culture that is unique to a diverse community that makes Cambodia town what it is today.\nSpeaker 1: The center will be essential for us to move forward from no history, no self taught, to know history, to know yourself, which is a essential part of building community capacity, reimagination and power. Uh. Although the Cambodian American Cultural Center will hold great significance for the Cambodian community in cultural peacekeeping, police keeping.\nSpeaker 1: It will also serve as a space to share knowledge and community expertize from all communities of color. Because the path towards collective liberation is together, not separate. As Angela Davis mentioned, we need to create spaces to dream first, to then reach re-imagine futures.\nSpeaker 1: Disinvestment is part of the longer movement for racial equity and reconciliation. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next, this is Dennis Main, followed by Christina Lee, then Mark Hobson.\nSpeaker 0: Then trip the welcome. Thank you council members for introducing this topic. My name is Suzanne Thiam and the executive director of the United Cambodian Committee. And on behalf of UCC, I urge you to support this Council item in support of a Long Beach Cambodian American Cultural Center.\nSpeaker 0: As folks have shared before me is that this space will create a safe space for commune members to not only learn, but also heal together from the genocide, but also for our young and next generation to be able to understand more about themselves and their identity as Cambodian Americans.\nSpeaker 0: In addition to that, the work that we do within our Cambodian community, UCC helped co-lead the Cambodian Town Thrives Collaborative, and our vision is to uplift the Cambodian vision plan for Cambodia Town, which includes actual development and investment within our communities.\nSpeaker 0: What that means is that we help different focus groups and community forums within this focus group and kumu forums, one that was held by Cambodian families and elders. The committee members shared that they really wanted a space to share their culture with one another.\nSpeaker 0: So they talked about being able to share food, language, but cost cross-cultural exchange not only about the Cambodian community, but also to learn about the Latin X community, about about the black community here in Long Beach. And so with that, this space can not only can only can also uplift the Cambodian culture, but also uplift cross-cultural solidarity\nSpeaker 0: and understanding across all of our communities. The ways that you see using that is that we're supporting the African-American Cultural Center and also the Latin X Cultural Center. So I urge you to support this counter item and to ensure that there's community input into this process, but also to build cross solidarity across other communities.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you. Next, we have Christina Lee and Mark Hobson and Roth from Christina.\nSpeaker 0: The River Sewer. Vice Mayor Rex Richardson, an honorable city council member. My name is Dr. Christina Lee. My practice is in the First District, and I'm also a local pastor at the Long Beach Cambodian American United Methodist Church, located in the fourth District.\nSpeaker 0: I am here to speak in support of the District six. Councilwoman Duff, the City South Agenda Number 19 for a number of reasons. So, number one, the Cambodian American Cultural Center, which I would call the center, is will be a place where we as a people can connect to our ancestor registry and to continue.\nSpeaker 2: Their legacy.\nSpeaker 0: As the descendents in the United States. The CAC center will also be a place where people and the children especially can gain a greater understanding of what the refugee had to overcome to be here today. The CAC Center will keep the heritage alive through knowing the loving and the beautiful cultural values of the authentic.\nSpeaker 0: My ways and that were nearly destroyed by the Khmer Rouge regime. And the.\nSpeaker 2: CAC.\nSpeaker 0: Center can contribute to the unique diversity.\nSpeaker 2: Of the.\nSpeaker 0: City of Long Beach, with the greater public understanding of the Cambodian American narrative through awareness and education. The center also will remind the Khmer children of the potential in the strength within them. So by making them aware that they can survive, they can do it despite what their background or their parents have gone through and they can\nSpeaker 0: harness to use that for their own pursuit. For example, so I was an orphan who arrived in the early eighties, but I was able to become who I am today through the loving and caring support of the Christian family who has supported me.\nSpeaker 0: And just because I was here and I didn't see any other people around, but there was some Cambodian community I could relate it to through the churches. The center will also be a place of the elderly where they can relax and relive the stress of life.\nSpeaker 0: And it's a position that's very important to have that connection and the support. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Fantastic. Next we have Mark Hobson, then Roth from the Angelina Train. Mark Okay, my name is Mark Hobson. I'm going to read a letter for gymnasts in case you couldn't make it today. So dear dear Vice Mayor Rex Richardson and honorary city council members.\nSpeaker 1: My name is Chan Hobson, executive director of the My Parent Association with an office located in the sixth District. And speaking on behalf of the Key Board of Directors in support of District Six. Councilwoman Susie Searles, Agenda Item 19 for a Long Beach Cambodian American Culture Center.\nSpeaker 1: For over 2000 years, Cambodia was well known for its many remarkable temples, such as Angkor Wat and its beautiful silk weaving. It also has a rich history of literature, arts, dance and culture. Unfortunately, much of the Cambodian arts and literature was almost destroyed by the communist Khmer Rouge, and the majority of artists and artisans were killed.\nSpeaker 1: This is why it is crucial to have a Cambodian cultural center that promotes and preserves my art, culture and history. For this reason, we come together today to support District Six Councilwoman Sylvie Sierra's agenda, item 19 from Long Beach, Cambodian American Culture Center.\nSpeaker 1: I urge you to support this item by voting yes on the agenda item 19. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Rock Prom and Angelina Tran and Anthony Vieira.\nSpeaker 0: Rock the Fool. Um, well, I will be her interpreter.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Look for Toy Story three chosen. Is the market like. Go off to the right problem. You've got people moving in like me. Two with one or more android, five door gear. Those who get paid for a film to try and acknowledge and stop looking like Nokia.\nSpeaker 0: Malcolm Gladwell. Some guy got repriced all that long term and tried to downplay the fact that all you're. My name is Prum. I am sorry that from beginning June would have thought. Vice Mayor Rick Richardson and City Council Member.\nSpeaker 0: My name is Robert. I am the resident of the District six. I live here in Long Beach since 1981. I am very active and getting involved in numerous volunteers activities and participating in meetings in the neighborhoods and in the city, such as neighborhood clean up, street, cleaning up, gathering three planning, tree watering to make our neighborhood free\nSpeaker 0: of traffic and beautify our city. Tonight. A lot of Americans might in a year come through an order from more or less a market column photograph and stuff like from movies like Beat Cop and Cardinal Law about the book My American.\nSpeaker 0: I am here. I am standing here in front of you to speak in support of the District six in the of the Cambodian American Cultural Center, the Law of Capital Crime. I am a Chicago D.A. like Damon Chapman.\nSpeaker 0: The way I am outcast to approach write that talk me and my twang your unfavorably ni forsyth I look back and let the cool calm of the uptight backgammon player for a little suck My folks, I'm fake You let my back roll now because I'm not like.\nSpeaker 0: The Cambodian cultural center is a place with the seniors, and the young people will have a chance to interact with each other, to learn about Khmer tradition, language, arts and culture from the past before the Cambodian genocide and the life of Calmeyer or to choose here in Long Beach to create a strong bond with the young generation\nSpeaker 0: . So the and third generation gaps will become closer to them no longer available. Wait a moment. Coming. Your own God gets much more clear. And also how bonding between the young generation so that the new generation can be mourned together.\nSpeaker 0: But the pearl cam, I mean, ran for some time, kind of, you know, I'm on my way to my I mean, let the pay up to wake you up to wake me up. I want the mountain of family and castle to wake up.\nSpeaker 0: And you have to say. It is very important to have the Cambodian American Cultural Center Center with the senior will have the opportunity to connect with other seniors for mutual support whenever the need will help them in that dialog with you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Almost all local control can be lost by watching out my job. To learn more about the poor. Come on. I'm an accountant, so therefore I'm asking for full support in the items by voting yes on agenda item 19 for the language Cambodian American Cultural Center.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. All right. Next is Angelina Tran. And after that is Anthony Guerra and then Linda Shay. Angelina.\nSpeaker 0: I saw Vice Mayor Rex Richardson, Honorable City Council members and city manager comedy. My name is Angelina Chen. I am a resident of District nine and I am the assistant peer leader of the Youth Inspiring Change and Unity Youth Group.\nSpeaker 0: The Cambodian American Cultural Center is a necessity for our youth to appreciate their culture and embrace their identity. Growing up in Long Beach, I didn't have much opportunity to thoroughly learn about our whole Cambodian culture because it wasn't taught in school.\nSpeaker 0: All I learned from my parents was that they lived through the horrific communist regime. And they had to flee the country and settle to settle in the United States. Hence, young Cambodian Americans growing up in Long Beach don't really know much about their own history, culture and language and authentic art.\nSpeaker 0: This will lead them to lose their own sense of identity. And I truly believe that our identity and heritage is much more than just surviving a genocide. We can't just let one tragedy define who we are as a community, and our community deserves to know about the beauty that our ancestors left behind.\nSpeaker 0: And for our elders and young generation alike, it would mean the world to us, for the Cambodian American Cultural Center to become a reality. I strongly ask for the full support from VICE. Mayor Rex Richardson and city council member.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, sir. Next is Anthony Guerrero, then Linda shave and math, then may lie. Anthony? Oh, yes, sir. My respects. Vice Mayor Rex Richardson and Honorable City Council members.\nSpeaker 0: My name is Anthony Guerrero.\nSpeaker 1: And I am the My Parents.\nSpeaker 0: Association peer leader of Youth Inspiring Change and Unity Youth Group. The Cambodian American.\nSpeaker 1: Cultural Center will be.\nSpeaker 0: The core center.\nSpeaker 1: That will highlight the rich cultural, intellectual and spiritual.\nSpeaker 0: Richness of the heritage of Cambodia. The ability to learn.\nSpeaker 1: About their.\nSpeaker 0: Beautiful language, the majestic arts that existed during the Korean period since the 12th.\nSpeaker 1: Century, and the.\nSpeaker 0: Knowledge of Cambodia.\nSpeaker 1: Before the dark years.\nSpeaker 0: Grant them the connection to their heritage that they deserve to know. This Cambodian cultural center will.\nSpeaker 1: Encourage them to cherish the beautiful.\nSpeaker 0: Heritage that still exists within Cambodian society today.\nSpeaker 1: This special.\nSpeaker 0: Cambodian.\nSpeaker 1: Cultural center is the place to highlight the.\nSpeaker 0: Legacy that they will continue here in the city of Long Beach and in the United States of America. I would like to welcome at least the City Council.\nSpeaker 1: To support.\nSpeaker 0: The creation of the Cambodian.\nSpeaker 1: American Cultural Center, to.\nSpeaker 0: Provide a means for the Intergenerational Committee residents to benefit and rebuild their own community and the relationships bonding with each other. With this with this transparency, transparency of this city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you. Next is Linda Shay. Then Maya laughs. And then same thing.\nSpeaker 0: Can Linda can be absurd. Good evening, Vice Mayor Rex Richardson and honorable council members. I'm Dr. Linda and I live in the first district here in Long Beach. I'm speaking in support of District Six. Councilwoman Dr. Sally Sara.\nSpeaker 0: Agenda Item 19 at for the support of the Long Beach Cambodian American Cultural Center. The Cambodian American Cultural Center will allow survivors of the killing fields to heal together with their loved ones. Cambodia has a rich literature, literary, artistic dance and cultural history that was almost lost in the war.\nSpeaker 0: Every survivor that has passed away takes with them an irreplaceable story of not only their lives in the killing fields, but Cambodia before the war had happened. Sharing these survivors historical memories with the young generation keeps the memories of not just the survivors, but the memories of the educated, creative, artistic Maya who built a great society before\nSpeaker 0: the war. The Cambodian American Cultural Center will be a place for the elders to alleviate isolation through having a sense of community that will enhance their quality of life. And in addition, speaking from a public health professional professional, I want to bring to your attention that it's going to provide a safe environment for them to tell their\nSpeaker 0: stories, share them, and definitely improve their emotional wellness and their health. So I urge you, please make this dream of ours happen. Thank you so much for your time.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next, we have Mueller. Then Hancock. Dan. Then trial. Sonia.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Hello. My name is that. It's made me a laugh. And I am a Cambodian American refugee who had the privilege of learning the sacred art form of Cambodian classical dance in Long Beach. It is such a privilege for me to be here and advocate for this center.\nSpeaker 0: Since I was 12 years old, I was part of my arts academy. Since its incorporation in 2000 to first as a student. For the last several years, as an as an instructor and the managing director of the Long Beach programs, I have the responsibility of being one of the gatekeepers of our culture and traditional arts.\nSpeaker 0: And because we almost lost this art and we're only here by the surviving 10% of artists. Long Beach has the opportunity to help unite all of the remaining artists and provide the space to preserve this altogether by having the center.\nSpeaker 0: It's my pride to pass down our culture and tradition to the next generation and remind the older generation that is not forgotten. It is difficult for a parent to speak about their past and what they've gone through. But I have witnessed their stories, their tears, as they felt inclined to share about their past.\nSpeaker 0: It is during these moments is when I realize that this art can be a form of healing for survivors from a young age. All I knew about Cambodian being Cambodian was only darkness. I never knew the details of what my parents went through and just only knew about violence and suffering.\nSpeaker 0: And it wasn't until I enrolled in dance school was in, I discovered the rich and vibrant history of Cambodia. Being a dancer allowed me to learn the history and tradition of what Cambodian is, and having this hub will allow our community to grow and thrive even more in this diversity.\nSpeaker 0: The younger generation will have a safe space where they can learn and understand where they ancestors came from and help them understand their identity. Your time is up. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Next is Song Con, then Charles Song. Then Andy Song can be up. Before we thought we were still looking at banana. Good evening.

My name is Tom Song. I am a co-chair of the Equity for Cambodians. And a community organizer. I like my fellow brother and sister to speak in support of District six.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Farrow's Agenda Item 19 for a Long Beach Cambodian American Cultural Center. Long Beach is home to the largest population of Cambodia outside the Kingdom of Cambodia. This is due to meeting tomorrow, resettling and immigrating to the city after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979.\nSpeaker 1: The Cambodian Genocide Watch a traumatic moment in history where millions of lives were lost and those who survived, including my family, were severely traumatized by the ordeal. During this period, much of the arts and cultures had been destroyed and nearly lost forever.\nSpeaker 1: This is why it is crucial to have a Cambodian cultural center where most could have a place to heal and promote preserved art and culture. City of Long Beach is also home to amazing culture, including the Museum of Latin American Art, the Pacific Island Ethnic Museum, the Homeland Cultural Center, and the Long Beach of Japanese Cultural Center\nSpeaker 1: . The construction of the Cambodian American Cultural Center will continue the ongoing tradition of celebrating the diverse art and culture in Long Beach. Honorable Vice Mayor and Ottoman Council Members. It is so right for you to support this item and I thank you so much for it.\nSpeaker 1: Next we have Andy Redd and Charles Wong. Chad Wong and then. Totally normal. So, Andy, Europe, soul mate, vice mayor of education and I am both city council members. My name is Andy RATH, and I'm a freshman at Cass High School in Dominguez Hills.\nSpeaker 1: I'm also a resident in the seventh District. In a youth aspiring change in unity member. As a Cambodian American youth, I don't know much about Cambodian history and have no ideas about the trauma that my grandparents had gone through during the communist Khmer Rouge regime.\nSpeaker 1: I know that my story is not reflected in what I see in the textbooks. The stories that I learned from my parents about the Civil War and the genocide, along with the challenges of resettling in the United States.\nSpeaker 1: I heard about the youth issues, the mental health, and the challenges our people faced as refugees. Yet every time I look at photos and paintings of the wonder of Angkor Wat and other temples that were built during the Mai Empire, I know that there's a lot more for me to learn about my grandparents and.\nSpeaker 1: Parents history and trauma and pain. I want to learn more about my heritage and the rich civilization that our people had. I have a definite belief that the Cambodian American Culture Center will be a place not only not just a place where our grandparents, parents and elders to share their sad and happy stories to help each other\nSpeaker 1: . But a place for youth. For a place where the youth can go to, for inspiration, to learn more about our identity and to recognize the potential that we have inside us. We like to have a place where we can be together and recognize what it is to be American.\nSpeaker 1: I am standing here on behalf of all of my youth as.\nSpeaker 0: Time has expired.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you so much. Next is Chad Wong in satin of Mom. The Invention, a grainy chat. Good evening, Vice Mayor and city council members. My name is Chad and I have been a resident of the sixth district for 41 years.\nSpeaker 1: I am here this evening speak in support of Agenda 19 for Long Beach, Cambodian American Culture Center. The city of Long Beach has been home to many cultural sites that have been blessed to be a culinary vendor in the past.\nSpeaker 1: With the Museum of Latin American Art. The Pacific Island. At the museum, the Homeland Cultural Center and Long Beach, Japanese culture. But I have yet to work with my own culture center. It's because we never had one. There are so many residents from the past 41 years.\nSpeaker 1: That are of Cambodian descent. They have made great strides and made historic and historical contributions to the Cambodian American community and to the city of Long Beach. They brought with them the importance of art and culture for four decades.\nSpeaker 1: It's been sewn into the fabric of the Cambodian community, the Sea, Long Beach and the Greater Long Beach area. I personally know so many friends, residents and former residents of the Cambodian. American background. They are successful in Korea, such as public servants, lawyers, police officers, doctors, nurses, teachers and business owners.\nSpeaker 1: They have paved the way for so many of us. Having the Cambodian Culture Center will be of great importance for Cambodian Americans and for the city of Long Beach. It will bring Cambodian history and give cultural equity. It can be a place to share among other rich cultures, within our city and abroad.\nSpeaker 1: I urge you to support this item by voting yes on agenda item 19 for a Long Beach Cambodian American Culture Center.

Thank you. And as you now reach out to me when I can be helpful.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilmember You want to thank you back, Mayor, and I want to thank everybody who came today and offered their comments on this very important item. I think it's part of the evolution of Long Beach. I mean, back in the day, we were known as the International Hotel, and that certainly is true and true today.\nSpeaker 1: I always talk about the story when in 1983, 84, when the U.S.S.R. first opened up, I was part of the committee that made the transition from the La Raza Neighborhood Center to the United Cambodian Center. And that was the beginning of a long relationship between myself and the community community as well as between the commuter community and\nSpeaker 1: Long Beach. We welcomed you then. We welcome you now. And this center that we have is just going to be another great step forward in the growing relationship that we have with each other. More importantly, for me, cultural centers like these we have in the Filipino community, Latino community definitely is about our children and it's about our\nSpeaker 1: children learning about our cultures and the cultures that we grow and we maintain the strength of our diversity in our city. So I welcome this opportunity to investigate this ability to open a center in the kimono community and looking forward to having a center identified and a groundbreaking in the very near future.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.\nSpeaker 0: And so thank you, Vice Mayor. And I just want to say thank you to Councilwoman Farrow for bringing this item forward and Councilmember Turanga and Vice Mayor Restaurant Richardson for signing on to this very important item for a Cambodian American cultural center.\nSpeaker 0: I also just really appreciated all the speakers that came here today. Just thank you for sharing your stories and your heart with us. I especially enjoyed hearing the youth talk about their desire to learn more about their history and their heritage.\nSpeaker 0: And it's just a beautiful testament to how important this cultural center is going to be and mean to the community. I supported the feasibility study for the creation of a Latino cultural center, and I also believe it's important to promote the development of our Cambodian community and culture also.\nSpeaker 0: Our diverse communities here in Long Beach deserve cultural preservation and beautiful spaces to learn about each other. So I just really look forward to you, you know, identifying a location and I just can't wait to see that happen.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I want to just start then my support. Thank Councilmember Thoreau for bringing this item forward. We have really turned a corner in the city, and in the last few years, we both dedicated ourselves to celebrating culture, celebrated art, and really put in our.\nSpeaker 1: Our values are where our mouths are, so to speak, in terms of celebrating diversity. And this is another step in that direction. I think this is long overdue. I look forward to working with this community to make this cultural center a reality, along with the African-American Cultural Center, along with that next American Cultural Center.\nSpeaker 1: We will be able to have a world class city that I think we will all be proud of, but be an example for other cities across the country. Thank you, gentlemen. WOMAN They have.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Vice Mayor. Thank you very much, Councilwoman Sara, for bringing this item forward. I think it's only fitting that in, in a city where we pride ourselves with our diversity, that we finally bring in a Cambodian cultural center.\nSpeaker 2: I think that's amazing, amazing news. I know that I have a lot of Cambodian community in me in my district, and I want to thank all of you from my district that came and spoke today. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: And I look forward to supporting the Cambodian cultural center every step of the way. So congratulations on this historic item. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. And I want to thank all those who came out tonight to support in favor of this item. I think it's a fantastic item. I want to thank a couple and Sara for bringing it. And like my colleagues have stated, our culture and our diversity in the city of Long Beach is what makes us\nSpeaker 0: so special. And anything that I can do to help support different communities being able to celebrate and honor their culture and their traditions and set a framework for the future generations to be able to be rooted in the culture of their.\nSpeaker 0: They're their parents or grandparents and those who came before them. I will be happy to do so. I, like many of my colleagues, have stated, I stand here ready to support anything you may need to move forward.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman. Super not. Well, thank you to all the speakers here tonight for sharing your stories. Also, a special thanks to the fourth District residents and those representing organizations headquartered in the fourth District for speaking tonight. And I look forward to supporting this item.\nSpeaker 1: Fantastic, Councilwoman Sorrell.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I you know, I want to add that in addition to creating this Cambodian American Cultural Center, it's just adding to the Latino Cultural Center, as well as the African-American Cultural Center. That well will have the space to be able to understand our roots and celebrate and promote the arts we're able to cross, come together to\nSpeaker 0: learn from each other as well. That's what I hope we can do. But I also didn't expect to get so emotional as each speaker came and spoke. It just reaffirmed why this is so important and I am starting to get emotion again, just talking about it.\nSpeaker 0: So I just appreciate all of you for coming to speak your heart and your mind and your soul about what a dream this process is to begin exploring, creating a plan and a vision together in unity with our elders and our youth so that we're able to come together and root ourselves and to be able to grow\nSpeaker 0: together in this process. So a countdown. Thank you, jambalaya.\nSpeaker 1: All right, a fantastic item. Congratulations again, members. Please cast your vote.\nSpeaker 0: Councilwoman Mongo. Motion is carried.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: And so we'll take item six, six and seven together through Jim separately.\nSpeaker 5: I would suggest together.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's what I'm thinking too. Okay, good. So six and seven together. So that is proposed ordinance 2016 0311 and 03181 being an ordinance and one being a motion. So, Mr. Wagner, will you take them away?\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Madam Chair. Nick Wagner, council staff. The staff report on these two pieces of legislation begins on page 57 of your materials, both proposed ordinance 2016 0311 and proposed motion 2016 0318 would help make the wording of the King County Charter and the King County Code gender neutral.\nSpeaker 5: And by gender neutral I mean wording. That does not imply that certain roles are suited exclusively or primarily to a particular gender. For example, the term fireman could be interpreted as implying that firefighters are normally men, whereas the term firefighter is free of that implication.\nSpeaker 5: The goal of making language gender neutral is not new, as shown by the excerpt from the 2003 edition of the Chicago Manual of Style that is quoted at the top of page 58 of your materials. Three years earlier, this Council had adopted what is now Section 1.03.120. A of the King County Code, which is quoted in the\nSpeaker 5: middle of page 58 and which requires the use of gender neutral, gender neutral language in the code that excuse me, that provision, however, is prospective only it does not affect the gender specific language that is already in the code or in the charter unless that language happens to be amended for other reasons.\nSpeaker 5: As a result, the transition to gender or gender neutral language in the code and the charter has been slow, as noted in proposed motion 2016 0318 the proposed ordinance and motion that is before you would address that problem, the ordinance would place on the November ballot a charter amendment making the charter language gender neutral.\nSpeaker 5: The ordinance, which is attachment one that pages 61 to 76 of your materials, is 16 pages long. There is also a technical amendment, Amendment One, which is attachment to a page 77 of your materials. Since the county code is much longer than the charter, making it gender neutral is a larger project in its original form.\nSpeaker 5: Proposed Motion 26. 0318. Would direct the Council Clark to develop a plan and timeline for the project. There is a proposed amendment, Amendment One, which is the attachment for page 83. However, that amendment has been superseded by Amendment two, which has been distributed to this morning, I believe, and which directs the Clerk of the Council to develop\nSpeaker 5: options for the Council to consider and provides guidance for developing those options. And my understanding is that the sponsor that Amendment two is considered a friendly amendment by the original sponsor of proposed Motion 2016 0318. In particular, Amendment two specifies that one of the options must be performing the work within existing staff resources.\nSpeaker 5: There's also a title amendment T one, which also was distributed this morning, which would conform the title to the motion as amended by Amendment two. And that concludes my staff report. Unless there are any questions.\nSpeaker 0: I don't have any questions, but I know we have an expert on board on this topic. So is there anybody like to make any comments on this? Councilmember Ko Well, since you're the expert, you want to comment? Thank you, Madam Chair.\nSpeaker 0: I don't know that I'm an expert on this, but I do. I am experienced. Well, hopefully your experience makes you next expert. Sometimes that goes hand in hand. Not always. However, I'd like to give a little bit of background here in a couple of ways.\nSpeaker 0: First of all, I think it was in mid-January when other the other new council member, Claudia Balducci and I and our staff were receiving an orientation right here in our chambers on our charter and codes and many other things.\nSpeaker 0: And both Councilmember Bill Dutchie and I and our staff, both our staff, all of our staff had noticed when we were looking over materials that the charter had contains gender specific language. And what really caught my eye, and I believe the others, was that council members are referred to as councilmen or councilman throughout the charter.\nSpeaker 0: So we were very interested and we talked about it later and I talked to the various people here and we kind of put on our radar that this would be something that would be worthy of change. But we were just getting used to becoming council members too, so it all got delayed a bit.\nSpeaker 0: But I would like to back up to the year 2007 and in this year I had an experience that I had in which I had no idea what was going to be happening. As it all played out for many, many years that I had been approached by one of the city and Seattle Councilmember with a female firefighter\nSpeaker 0: who worked at that time, had worked for ten years as a Seattle firefighter, but she was referred to as the fire man in everything. And she thought after ten years of serving her community in a very, very high risk capacity, that she should not have to be called the council fireman any longer.\nSpeaker 0: And so they requested that I introduce legislation in the state Senate. And as we started looking into this and found that at the federal level, occupational and professional terms had been changed in the federal codes quite some time before that.\nSpeaker 0: And we looked into it and ended up I introduced legislation and you have a copy on a peer if you want to take a look. 2007. Which was an Gore's Senate bill eventually 5063. The bill report enacted is very short.\nSpeaker 0: Might take a look at it, but it specifically says that the code revised are in consultation with the statute. Law Committee must develop and implement a plan to correct gender specific references. Then the code making annual recommendations to the Legislature with completion by June 30th, 2015.\nSpeaker 0: So that started the whole process. We actually finished two years earlier. Each bill. During every legislative session during that time was like this that I and it was the 1983 that state they required that all statutes be written in gender neutral terms, just as was the case as Nick presented.\nSpeaker 0: And I think you said, Nick, that was 2000.\nSpeaker 5: That's right.\nSpeaker 0: Prospectively, but not retroactively. So a number of us thought that this would be something worthwhile to have completed, both in the charter, which involves a charter amendment. So we'd go before the voters next November. And in our code, having experienced this for so long, I do have one thing that I think is really important to bring out\nSpeaker 0: , and that is that in no way does any change require that our residents and our citizens speak in non gender specific language. They can still call people fire men if they want. There's nothing to do with what our citizens, our residents do.\nSpeaker 0: It's more what is reflected in our codes and this sense retroactively from before, nothing. Secondly, nothing would change the meaning of the codes, the substance. It's strictly the use of terms that are gender specific, changing to gender neutral.\nSpeaker 0: I have to say, Nick, I think you did a great job of making the changes in the charter for the proposed ordinance and ballot measure. Really good job on that.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. It was a group effort, I should mention.\nSpeaker 0: And secondly, I if it's all right, I would like to have a code revise or I come by to ask him something specifically. Bruce Ritson if that's all right, Madam Chair. Certainly. Thank you, Bruce. When when you and and Nora.\nSpeaker 0: So Clare and Nick talked about this initially you contacted Kyle Bass and the legislative code advisor who worked with me all these years and got information from him. And I'm interested in the just you're giving a brief summary of what came out of those conversations for our work ahead if we do adopt it.\nSpeaker 1: Hi, I'm Bruce Ritson, the code advisor. Yes, I spoke a bit with Kyle Thiessen and some of his staff, specifically the attorneys who worked on the project. I think one of the things that we came up that would be different from us is that they have an interim time when they can work on projects that it's kind\nSpeaker 1: of a downtime for the legislature in the summer. And they dedicated about ten people to this project, two attorneys, but other staff members to the project. And they came, they had limitations. They had to work with specifically size limitations.\nSpeaker 1: So they worked up to about a 500 page per year limit. But even within that limit, they were able to complete the project two years earlier. As you mentioned. I think the one thing that comes to mind is that some of the things seem easier than they might be.\nSpeaker 1: Just on the surface of it, there were some things where they ran into words that either had some kind of limitations on changing them. For instance, something might have a federal term that is close to that that also been applied to them.\nSpeaker 1: And so they had to work out some things with different interest groups and experts. That was more than they were anticipating. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that they kept it extremely limited to just changing gender neutral terms.\nSpeaker 1: So it wasn't any other kind of clean up going on there with the language. So that that's the kind of thing I ran into. They were very helpful. They gave me their word list of what they used and other reference materials that they used and found helpful.\nSpeaker 1: The other thing that they pointed out is that in retrospect, they thought that maybe some other approaches may have been taken. For instance, instead of changing things like him, him to him or her, to actually cite the actor rather than introducing the him or her issue.\nSpeaker 1: So hopefully we'll be able. Get even a more improved product from that effort. The other thing is there's still some times when something sneaks up on them that they hadn't realized for whatever reason. Very occasionally. But that happens as well.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much, Bruce. And with that, I recommend both of these to you. And I think that it's important to note we do very serious work here at the council and we represent our constituents. This may seem as though it's not as important substantively compared to other work that we do, but I do believe that it\nSpeaker 0: is important and it's very symbolic, too, in terms of eliminating biases that we have in our code and in our codes and in our charter that I think can be handled. And I think it's the 21st century. I mean, this is something we should do.\nSpeaker 0: Well, thank you. So I have one question. Council members, this is your history with this. I might ask you to put it, for instance, here, that we use the Chicago Manual of Style. Have we as a council ever approved that or do we know?\nSpeaker 5: Madam Chair, that is simply a reference work that I cited as an example of a recognized authority that supports the use of gender, gender neutral language.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Because I know that we use a style that everybody uses and the state level and there's some parts of that style like making King County the capital. I mean, little C's on county and and some kinds of rivers with little others that.\nSpeaker 0: As you said not too long ago, forget everything you learn in English, which is tough since I'm a former English teacher. So that bothers me. Why? Why are we doing that? Because I don't think that's what's being taught in college or in elementary schools.\nSpeaker 0: So it's it's jarring to read it when it's written like that.\nSpeaker 1: It is based on the approach that was taken by the state of minimal minimizing things like capitalization. It is a rather standard approach to take to writing, though. Mean it's not unusual. And in fact, some of many of the style manuals follow a similar kind of style.\nSpeaker 1: But we do have some specific rules that we selected. But it's you have to select one way or another. And we have gone in certain directions for making the choices. But it's also the approach is very much like the state took, and it's very similar to other states and other municipalities and how they approach it as well\nSpeaker 0: . Yeah. At some point I think we need to make a decision here. And I understand why there were typecasting days where you had to get the little other tool and, you know, whatever. But since it's all computerized, I don't see any problem with capitalizing words.\nSpeaker 0: And I'd be interested in knowing, does the University of Washington teach, you know, capitalize anything anymore? You know, when the universities are teaching, you don't capitalize anything that I'd be more comfortable saying. I swallow it. But until then, I really don't like it.\nSpeaker 0: So I just won't put that on the record that I think we at some point need to be looking to see how we want our charter to look. So people think that we're at least literate and so we don't drive old English teachers crazy, including me.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, so enough on that. The amendment that is here is for the other one. So let's take them separate for the book as well as an amendment. So Councilmember, were you put 2011 and 1216 03111 before us. Are you referring to me?\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Yes, I was. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I moved proposed ordinance 2016 0311. Thank you very much. And I believe we do have one technical amendment.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, there's a technical amendment. Amendment one on page 77 of your materials.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: It simply supplies a word that was inadvertently omitted.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's a really tough one. Councilmember, you put the amendment number one before us under the adoption of the amendment. All right. I think there's there's a reason for that one, for sure. So all those in favor of adding the word properly, please say I, I as opposed nay.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So now we go to the underlying motion as a motion or ordinance. This is an it's a motion underlying ordinance.\nSpeaker 5: This is a motion proposed motion. 2016 0318.\nSpeaker 0: No, I'm looking at 311131.\nSpeaker 5: Oh, I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Excuse. So that's an ordinance, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the underlying ordinance as amended, is before us. This is the charter amendment. Are those in favor, please?\nSpeaker 1: Sorry. Going to take comments or debate on this.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, so I didn't see anybody than I thought I would comment that and the second one. But it's long as I'm speaking, I can say very, very briefly that it was one of those interesting moments at the beginning, you know, of the first week here as a council member to be reading documents that referred to me as\nSpeaker 0: councilman. I want to I think there's probably but not not a not a coincidence that in the year when you have two new council members, both of us women, that this comes up. But if this trend continues, I want to assure my diminishing number of male council members that we're not proposing to change the council woman.\nSpeaker 0: We just want to make it, say, council member so you can all be included as well. Thank you. You're more gentle nature. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm glad to hear that. All right. Well, I'm glad to have two more council members who happen to be women on board.\nSpeaker 0: So with that, yes. Council member.\nSpeaker 1: Betty, I first of all, I would have no problem being called council woman. We're in a new era here. But I just wanted to take a moment to thank, actually, both council members, Cole, Wells and Vale duty for taking up this issue.\nSpeaker 1: And just straight back or just harking back to a little bit of history, it's appropriate that Council member Cole Wells is the prime sponsor of this charter amendment. She represents District four on the Council and District four elected the first woman to the new King County Council, Bernice Stern.\nSpeaker 1: That was in 1968, after the voters approved the Charter amendment, creating this Council on changing from a three member commissioner form of government. Renee Stern's campaign theme was, quote, We need a woman on the new nine man, King County Council.\nSpeaker 1: So today, that anachronism and hope is being fixed. And and that's, I think, all for the good. And I think it's very appropriate that the councilmember from District four has taken the lead on it, given the history here.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for that bit of history. And I'm sure Bernice is looking down with a smile. Councilmember Robinson. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Councilmember Dombroski, for that little bit of history lesson for us. I'd also like to thank Councilmember Lambert because she was very involved with this effort as well and very supportive and has made\nSpeaker 0: really good suggestions as well as on the motion that will come up right after this. And I really appreciate all the support. We have six sponsors on this proposed ordinance, which I very much appreciate. Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: All right. So now we are ready for the clerk to call the vote. Thank you, Madam Chair. Councilmember Belge.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember, dumbass.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Done. All right. Councilmember Garcia by Councilmember Carlos I Councilmember McDermott, Councilmember Up The Grove Councilmember by Mike Bauer. Madam Chair, I am chair with seven Eisner notes and council members McDermott and Broderick are excused. Excellent. So on this, the next question will be next week.\nSpeaker 0: Do we need something that will say who? Right. The pros and the cons statements for this?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. Assuming the council takes final action in support of the amendment, that would be the next step.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, that's what I thought. So if you could start preparing that and I'm assuming Councilmember Caldwell's that you would want to be one of the names. So anybody else interested in, you know, being a pro on this, let us know.\nSpeaker 0: And so we'll be ready to do that or didn't see any calls here, but anybody who's interested can do that. All right. So now we're at the motion sheet, thousand 60318 and this is going into the code and we've been briefed and we've been briefed on the amendment.\nSpeaker 0: And so amendment number one has been pulled because it was improved in amendment number two.\nSpeaker 3: So I want to say something to you.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Gossett. Madam Chair, we forgot to ask you whether you wanted to expedite this and whether you want it on consent. Well, I don't think so, because I think everybody want to speak to it. So expediting, okay.\nSpeaker 0: Expedite, but not on consent. Thank you for asking that. Okay, so let's put this before us. Councilmember Caldwell's, will you put 20 60318 before us? Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes, I proposed motion 2016 0318 before us. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And Councilmember Bell, did you would you move your amendment? Amendment two. Thank you. Would you like to speak to it at all? I would think. Okay. And thank you for joining me on this amendment. The motion, it's also asks for a a report or workplan from our county clerk that explains how we're going to go through this\nSpeaker 0: process of amending the entirety of the King County Code, which has been reported that if it was printed out, which it isn't any longer, about 6000 pages. So it's a it's a body of work. And what the amendment would do is ask that the clerk, when she provides us the draft workplan for approval, include options.\nSpeaker 0: I wanted us to be mindful of the fact that we're going into a year when we're going to have county functions really pressed for for funding in our budget. We have a budget shortfall coming up. And so as we go forward with this work, I just wanted to be thoughtful about the fact that we should do it\nSpeaker 0: in a way that is the least impactful to staff workload, both in the council side of the government and in the executive branch and in the other place. We might need to look for help, but also mindful of the costs so that we minimize the cost.\nSpeaker 0: It's an important thing to do, but it can be done over time and that I think we should do that in a way that both gets it done and is thoughtful and mindful of our budget constraints as a county so that the purpose of the amendment as offered and I can answer any questions if anybody has any\nSpeaker 0: . Thank you. I thank you for that amendment. And I and I agree with everything you said it's important to do, but we need to keep it in balance with everything else that's important to do in the county. So all those in favor of Councilmember Caldwell's.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Madam Chair. And I do support this amendment and I appreciate councilman respected she and Lambert bringing it forward. Everything in here, I believe, was implied, but I think it's really helpful to have it specified. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for a collaboration on all of this. And so all those in favor of amendment number two, please say those opposed nay, the amendment is approved and now we have the underlying major motion. Yes, there's a title amendment because of the passage of amendment.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, I may move amendment one. Do we have that someplace? It's in the packet that was handed out with amendment to it. It just changes the title to say Develop Options for how to apply gender neutral references. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Okay. Although I am in favor of the title amendment, please say I. I as opposed name the title amendment and thank you for catching that. All right. Thank you. All right. Now we urge the underlying motion.\nSpeaker 0: And so any final comment? Okay. Others could please consider that. Thank you, madam chair. Councilmember Chai councilmember number five councilmember Dan all Councilmember Johnson. AAM councilmember for well I Councilmember McDermott councilmember of the world I don't remember fun writer.\nSpeaker 0: Madam chair I know those councilmembers McDermott and Don are excused. Excellent. So that is let's do the same thing with expedite so the be at the same time but not I'm concerned. Okay. I don't see any other business.\nSpeaker 0: Is there any other business to come before the body at this time? With that, the meeting is adjourned. Thank you. Don't forget to.\n",

I'm going to have Councilman Ortega please read Proclamation 1290.\nSpeaker 6: I will be happy to. Proclamation number 1290 Series of 2017 in recognition of 2017 National Hunger and Homeless Awareness Week in Denver, the Denver metro area. Whereas everyone has a right to healthy food and a safe place to live.\nSpeaker 6: And. Whereas, everyone of any age, background or zip code can be affected by hunger and homelessness. And. Whereas, according to the Colorado Children's Campaign, nearly one in six. Let me say that again. One in six Colorado kids face hunger every day.\nSpeaker 6: They may receive their only meal at school. And. WHEREAS, thousands of people in Denver work hard to secure a better future but must choose between paying rent, buying needed medications and purchasing groceries. And. WHEREAS, systemic issues of hunger and homelessness have a wide ranging and harmful impact on individuals and on our community.\nSpeaker 6: And. Whereas, lack of sufficient healthy food stunts, brain development and physical growth diminishes motivation and productivity, hinders education and deteriorates one's health. And. Whereas, support programs for people without enough money for food and housing help build a foundation for a better, healthier lives and a better, healthier Denver.\nSpeaker 6: Whereas, government agencies, along with food pantries, shelters, faith based groups and other community based organizations strive to address the needs in our community. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one Hunger and Homeless Awareness Awareness Week is intended to educate the public, raise awareness about poverty in our community\nSpeaker 6: , and encourage people to get involved in anti-poverty organizations. In Section two, we recognize that many community organizations do impactful work to fight hunger and poverty, organize volunteers, and provide much needed food and services that lift our entire community, including hunger free.\nSpeaker 6: Colorado Metro Kerry. Bienvenidos Denver. Inner City Paris. Sid de la Raza Community Ministry and local organized local school organized effort such as Teller Backpack Friends, among many others. Section three November 13 through 19 is declared as Hunger and Homeless Awareness Week, and you are urged to donate to these organizations mentioned or a local food bank in your\nSpeaker 6: community or the food bank of the Rockies. Section four that the clerk of the city and county of Denver affix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to hunger free Colorado metro carrying then beneath those Denver inner city Paris said vicious de la, a community ministry and\nSpeaker 6: teller backpack friends.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman. Your motion to adopt.\nSpeaker 6: Mr. President, I move for the adoption of proclamation number 1290.\nSpeaker 1: It has been moved and seconded. It comes by the council. Councilman Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. You know, we're fortunate that Denver is a city that has many organizations who who step forward and come to the aid of folks in our community who are struggling. I'm aware of many, many different churches and both nonprofit and for profit organizations that that step up and in provide food to people in our\nSpeaker 6: community. It's not unusual to see in the park across the street different organizations who come down and provide a meal to people who are in the park, many of whom are homeless or we have. And in many cases, they're both nonprofit and for profit organizations.\nSpeaker 6: We have a group that serves one meal a month over at Saint Elizabeth's Church, on the area campus that provides a hot meal. And I'm sure there are different organizations there every Sunday after mass providing a meal to two folks in our community when some of our day shelters are closed during the weekends.\nSpeaker 6: So oftentimes they provide a meal. But when they're closed, you know, that's a day when people otherwise wouldn't be getting food. And so the fact that we have organizations that. Gather their friends and other volunteers to prepare the meals and to bring them down and to to serve them and to not just provide the meal, but to\nSpeaker 6: to to be a kind face on the other end. Because oftentimes we find that many of our homeless folks feel so isolated. But to learn that we have so many families also in our community that are struggling. And when you see the cranes across our metro area, including our downtown and in all the development and construction, you\nSpeaker 6: would think that we wouldn't have this kind of poverty and challenge in our community. But it does exist. And this is the time of year when people. You know, open up their hearts and their pocketbooks and they're committed to trying to help their fellow neighbor, their fellow man that that has found themselves in a situation of of\nSpeaker 6: need. And there's nothing worse than just going hungry and not having access to food. So I want to first say thank you to all of the organizations in the city of Denver that that do this day in and day out or shelters do this day in and day out.\nSpeaker 6: So I just want to encourage the adoption by my colleagues, and I want to thank Joe Wood for my staff who helped put the proclamation together. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And thank you for bringing this forward. See no other comments, Madam Secretary.\nSpeaker 4: Raquel Ortega. I SUSSMAN High Black. Clark High. Espinosa High. Flynn, I Gilmore. Herndon, I Cashman High Kennedy I Lopez. I knew Mr. President.\nSpeaker 1: I Please close the voting and announce the results. We have somebody hanging fire. All right, please close voting in us. Results 3913 I Proclamation 1290 has been adopted. Councilwoman, is there anyone you want to bring in there?\nSpeaker 6: I have a couple of folks, so I'd like to ask Vicky O'Neil, who's the senior vice president with Hunger-Free, Colorado. She'll be introducing Andrea Fuller. And then we have Vincent Marnell with the Teller Backpack Friends, Joyce Neufeld with community ministry and Linda Jamison with Denver Inner City Parish, who will be speaking.\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, and thank you to Joe Wood for coordinating our presence here. And thank you to the entire council for the proclamation. It takes public private partnerships to successfully address a problem in our community like hunger.\nSpeaker 2: And we've been very fortunate to enjoy very robust and meaningful partnerships with organizations like Denver Human Services. And I want to shout out to their leaders Don Morris and Todd Jorgensen, for their support over the years in tackling this issue and also the many nonprofit organizations, food banks, food pantries in the city who are doing this work\nSpeaker 2: . Like you said, every day we are actually seeing the impacts of these partnerships. When Hunger Free Colorado started in 2009, Colorado had the fastest growing child poverty rate in the United States. And at that same time, our children had the lowest participation rate in the federal food nutrition programs.\nSpeaker 2: And so, for example, we were 44th in the nation for school breakfast participation and today were 12th. Back then, in 2009, one in six of the general Colorado population were experiencing hunger. Today, that's one in ten. And as you mentioned, today, we're one in six children experiencing hunger.\nSpeaker 2: In 2015, that number was one in five. So you can see that we're we're moving the needle, but we still have quite a bit of work left to do. And in order to do that, we need the public and private sectors to come together collaboratively to work on solving this very solvable issue.\nSpeaker 2: Tonight we have Andrea Fuller here to talk for a moment about her experience with this issue. Thank you. Good evening, Council. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for putting this proclamation in order. I want to ask a couple of questions.\nSpeaker 6: How many of you have ever had to go hungry or.\nSpeaker 2: Missed a meal, but not by choice? What would you do if you did not know how you were going to feed your family? This is the reality for thousands of mothers, children, fathers and others in metro Denver. Food, health and housing are inextricably linked together.\nSpeaker 2: And I know this from experience. I am a mom.\nSpeaker 6: Owner of three small businesses, an entrepreneur.\nSpeaker 2: I have completed two college degrees. I work from 7 a.m. to almost midnight most days and work 6 to 7 days per week. And yet rent.\nSpeaker 6: Is over 50%.\nSpeaker 2: Of my income. And without snap, I would not be able to buy.\nSpeaker 6: The food that.\nSpeaker 2: All of my family needs to stay healthy and to continue working. I have had to skip meals or eat less. I have.\nSpeaker 3: Experienced illness due to not.\nSpeaker 2: Eating enough. There's absolutely no reason that anyone in this great state or city should go hungry. It is thanks to organizations such as Hunger Free Colorado and many others that were mentioned, including Metro Caring. And the opportunity to advocate through them that I am here in front of you today.\nSpeaker 2: This proclamation is a start, but there's so much more that we need to do. Affordable housing must be built and more prominently intentionally placed throughout the city. Laws and policies promoting less food waste and more readily accessible.\nSpeaker 6: Resources.\nSpeaker 2: In areas used most, such as Montebello, Globeville and North Park Hill, providing preventative health care. All of these needs are within reach if we work together as policymakers, advocates.\nSpeaker 6: Businesses, nonprofits and the community. Thank you for listening. And let's put words.\nSpeaker 2: And proclamation into real action. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Is Vincent here? Vincent Munnell with the Tiller Backpack program.\nSpeaker 7: I can't echo her sentiments enough. Thank you very much for seeing me. This was a very kind surprise with the tell it back to our program. If anybody here knows the Teller Elementary, we're in Congress Park. We have a pretty simple goal.\nSpeaker 7: We have a lot of kids that come to school for food. Kids shouldn't have to go to elementary school for food. They should want to learn. They just want to play. They should want to be kids. They should want to be led and mentored.\nSpeaker 7: They shouldn't in a community such as ours that was built on giving. It was built on taking care of one another that come together for any number of reasons. They're always there with with an open hand. Yeah. We have kids who walk to school past my very house.\nSpeaker 7: The Just want a bite to eat. So we we recognize the need about three years ago. Unfortunately, every year the need has grown. We went from helping five families to seven families, and now we're up to about 34.\nSpeaker 7: It's it's a very, very unfortunate circumstance when you live in a community that's surrounded by. For sale signs for homes that are, you know, seven or $800,000. And we have we have families that can't put food on the table for for young minds.\nSpeaker 7: So this is definitely a step in the right direction. The Tell Her Backpack program is it's a lofty goal to help end childhood hunger. But with, you know, with steps like this and with with groups like the Tell It Backpack Program and every other group, it's it's definitely achievable goal.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. And then we have one last speaker. Excuse me. I think we have two more Joyce Neufeld and then Linda Jemison.\nSpeaker 2: Well, thank you for allowing us to be here tonight and for also this proclamation. My agency, Community Ministry of Southwest Denver, serves about 35,000 individuals a year, and that's just a drop in the bucket in southwest Denver. So making people aware of hunger and homelessness is really important.\nSpeaker 2: And Andrea is an example of who we see the most of. It's the working poor. It's not necessarily a lot of homeless people, but it's the working poor people who struggle on a daily basis to put food on their tables.\nSpeaker 2: During the past two years, about six major food pantries have closed. Denver Urban Matters was one of the most recent that closed and that impacted the whole Colfax corridor there. They're moving their work to Saint Francis Center, but that's becoming more and more common that the smaller pantries are closing.\nSpeaker 2: Even the bigger pantries are closing due to lack of funding. So although we're aware of hunger and homelessness this week and especially during Thanksgiving holidays, we see a lot of people suddenly increase their awareness. It's all year round.\nSpeaker 2: The people are hungry. And so I'd ask that, you know, every day is Hunger and Homeless Awareness Week, and that every day we can have an impact on the lives of the kids. And organizations like Hunger Free Colorado are making a huge, huge impact, as well as all the other agencies that impact in so many different ways\nSpeaker 2: the garden, the food rescues. So many agencies are working together to make a difference in this community. So don't forget us all the rest of the year, not just at this time. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you for that important reminder. Linda Jamison, are you here? Okay. Come on forward, Larry. And then, Mr. President, Rudy Gonzales from Sid Vicious would like to make a few comments as well.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening. My name's Larry Martinez with Denver, inner city Paris. I'd like to say thank you to Councilwoman Ortega as well as the rest of city council for this proclamation and helping raise awareness. This is a very important issue and one that is solvable.\nSpeaker 7: You know, we live in a state where one out of nine people in Colorado struggle with hunger. I echo a lot of what was already said here tonight. The work that these organizations are doing is is very important.\nSpeaker 7: Inner city parish, we're distributing over \u00a335,000 of food every month and we're serving 1100 and duplicated individuals every month. And that number continues to grow and grow. And here, you know, at the same time, we're having organizations close and resources are getting more scarce.\nSpeaker 7: So like Joy said, you know, remember us throughout the year and Colorado gives us also coming up and remember us then. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Rudy, are you going to be the one speaking? Okay. If you can come forward. This is Rudy Gonzalez with Sid Vicious. La Raza.\nSpeaker 7: Yes. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you. Council. City Council. With me is Neva martinez, Ortega, who's our director of our emergency services program for Servicios de la Raza. We're a probably the largest one stop culturally responsive, linguistically specific provider in the state now providing multiple human services.\nSpeaker 7: And one of our turnkey programs is emergency services, which we have been providing our communities now for probably over 35 years. And we're a 45 year old agency fiscal year. We served over \u00a3170,000 of food to 15 to 16000 people.\nSpeaker 7: And that's infants, that's children, adolescents, disabled veterans, homeless, foster care. Every population you can think of, we have served we serve our elderly. We work with them on a lot of different levels to try to keep them sustainable and in their home hygiene.\nSpeaker 7: In-Home. So. We want to thank you for this proclamation, Councilwoman, and thank you for all of your votes. It is important we are serving those in crisis, the vulnerable, trying to get them to a safe level, a table level, and get them to thriving.\nSpeaker 7: And so I just want to introduce Neva martinez, Ortega, who has a little challenge for a city council.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, really. And thank you again, Councilman Ortega. As Rudy mentioned, we always struggle with funding in these programs. And currently our basic emergency services program, Food Pantry, is completely unfunded. But we are still working with our community partners and relying on our community to still make our holiday season and our everyday food bank happen.\nSpeaker 2: So I brought you all a little gift in bringing up this proclamation of a reusable grocery bag with our information, but also an opportunity to participate in our holiday events where we'll be providing 900 food boxes to the community.\nSpeaker 2: So I don't know who to give this to to give to you all. Thank you. But but with that is an opportunity to to help our organization and helping our community provide those food boxes.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you and thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Right.

        "source": "Speaker 6: Thank you, Mayor. This hearing involves the financial management department. The recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution amending the master fee and charges schedule.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. West.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Vice Mayor, members of the Council. Leah Erickson, our budget manager, will provide the staff report.\nSpeaker 7: Good evening, Mayor and council members. Today's city council's approval is being requested for the second quarter changes to the master fee and charge schedule. This schedule is updated at least twice a year to meet City Council's policy on user fees, which calls for full cost recovery whenever appropriate.\nSpeaker 7: The last time City Council amended the fee schedule was on September 3rd of 2013 as part of the fiscal year 2014 budget. Attachment A to the report includes seven departments with fee changes. And these fees include items such as in the clerk's office, increasing the fee for providing express passport services by a dollar to reflect the United\nSpeaker 7: States Postal Service's fee increase. It also includes fees for the Belmont Pool, the new outdoor pool. And these fees were based on a comparative analysis of other outdoor public pools. And it was meant to update and standardize the fees and related to the use of that pool.\nSpeaker 7: They should be noted, those those fees will be reviewed with the opening of the permanent Belmont Pool, and they are going to be retroactive for January 1st, 2014. In the police department, there's a number of general fees that are just being rounded to minimize use of change.\nSpeaker 7: So they're being rounded to the nearest whole dollar. And in, for instance, another example would be public works, charging a fee to cover the cost of printing no parking signs that are used in temporary construction zones. So like I said, seven departments do have fee changes as part of this this report and myself and members, representatives from\nSpeaker 7: those departments are here, if you have any specific questions.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. I'm going to move on to any sort of public comment on the hearing. Seeing none. I'm going to go and close the hearing and take it behind over here to the council. Councilor Morgenthau.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I just had a couple of questions for staff. One is, I think there's something in here. Why must the HIV AIDS health education classes start 30 minutes later than the closing time?\nSpeaker 0: To.\nSpeaker 7: Council Councilmember Lowenthal we will have Dr. Bitch Kushner from Health and Human Services here who can answer that question.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Lowenthal.\nSpeaker 10: The question was why the classes start a half hour.\nSpeaker 7: Later.\nSpeaker 10: Later than.\nSpeaker 7: Than the closing time of.\nSpeaker 10: The health.\nSpeaker 0: Department? Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Probably. It's more of a.\nSpeaker 10: Function of availability for the clients that are ordered.\nSpeaker 11: To take the course.\nSpeaker 10: That's the only reason I could give.\nSpeaker 7: Okay, that's. That's fine. I just thought that was peculiar. Peculiar? Sorry. The second question I had is under the news rack removal. And Dr. Kushner, I don't think that's your expertize, but if the owner fails to cure the violation within the stated number of business days, the news rack shall be removed and stored in a designated place\nSpeaker 7: . So Long Beach Municipal Code states that the owner shall pay the expenses of removal and storage of the newsroom. I'm just curious, do we have do we still have difficulty with the news rack removal? I know we did some time back.\nSpeaker 7: And I know you're proposing an $85 retrieval fee per rack, but is that based on the administrative work that it requires or a difficulty in compliance?\nSpeaker 6: Honorable, lone, tall.\nSpeaker 11: The cost is to recover the actual physical work that an employee has to go out to remove the rack, put it on a truck, and take it back to the yard and store it.\nSpeaker 7: So that's our retrieval.\nSpeaker 11: That's all retrieval.\nSpeaker 7: I mistook that about the.\nSpeaker 11: Administrative.\nSpeaker 7: Fee. Perfect. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: You think you can spiritual escape?\nSpeaker 8: Yes. Think I'm the Marine face. I would not be more prudent to wait till we've had the audit on him.\nSpeaker 0: On.\nSpeaker 8: The Marine face before we. You've got indication here about.\nSpeaker 0: And see what it says. Page.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. Cover administrative processing costs are proposed by the Marine Bureau. 10% increase for temporary slip late fees. I thought that we were going to have a complete audit of those fees. And wouldn't it be more appropriate to wait to the audits done before any change of any fee related to that?\nSpeaker 6: Councilman George Patton Director Parks, Recreation, Marine. I think the fees that we've got identified here for dry, dry boat storage and they aren't related to the audit. The audit, I think, deals more with what was being charged to the Marina Fund in terms of maintenance.\nSpeaker 8: Well, the temporary slip they would not be related to someone is using.\nSpeaker 6: That's a late fee.\nSpeaker 8: I understand that they charge, but that's cumulative on top of the other fees. I'm just asking if we're going to have an audit of that at that time. It might be appropriate to come back with all the increases suggested increases, because I would think the auditor would audit anything related to that.\nSpeaker 1: I don't believe that was in the scope of the audit.\nSpeaker 8: The auditors not here. So.\nSpeaker 1: We're going to have a response to that. I know that the order is not here. Well, I think that wasn't part of the audit scope.\nSpeaker 6: The scope was to look at the maintenance charges that was charged to the Marina Fund, not so much the slip fees and whether or not they were appropriate or the increases in slip fees.\nSpeaker 1: Container ships could do anything additional.\nSpeaker 8: That's why I think you got somebody.\nSpeaker 1: O'Donnell. Just two questions. Does this does this change the fee structure to the launch ramps at all? DAVIES, etc.? I don't believe so. Okay. And what about residential restricted parking permits like those around the colleges.\nSpeaker 8: For permanent.\nSpeaker 7: Purpose of.\nSpeaker 1: Residential preferential parking? Right. Typically, I believe at 30, maybe 65 now. Do they go up to 65? I'm trying.\nSpeaker 7: To. Councilmember O'Donnell, there are no changes to the parking fees.\nSpeaker 1: Great. So parking in lawn traps are left out. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: So let you finish this, Mr. Vice Mayor. Where are we with the emotion?\nSpeaker 0: No. The hearing?\nSpeaker 5: No. Is there emotion? All right. Any other questions will entertain emotion. Moved in second move against memberships seconded by Mr. O'Donnell. Any public comment? All right. Eight questions. CNN members cast your votes in hearing our number one.\nSpeaker 6: Motion carry seven votes. Yes. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Members. I probably need to comment on this because I didn't even know it was up. But you'll notice that the nameplate in front of me, says Admiral Bob Foster, Starfleet Command, which has been my lifelong dream. But they film Star Trek the movie here about four or five years ago.\nSpeaker 5: And and the know they made some improvements to this room. And if you watch the movie it outside the windows of San Francisco but it's in this room but they sounds.\nSpeaker 1: Like a campaign. They went out they found.\nSpeaker 5: Out that I was somewhat of a Trekkie. And the producer said, if I would have known that, I would have made the admiral who did the court martial. I would have said Admiral Bob Foster. I said, that would have been really great.\nSpeaker 5: So before they left, they gave me a nameplate that said Starfleet Command. So people have been calling me Admiral tonight, and I just kind of ignored it and I thought, What the heck is that going on? So anyway, that way explanation.\nSpeaker 1: Are you really are tricky.\nSpeaker 5: I love the look like the old Star Trek, right?\nSpeaker 1: And that's good.\nSpeaker 5: And I really enjoy the old star had some great themes in there. But anyway, that's neither here nor there. We're not going to solve that tonight. All right. We have public comment. I think that's correct. Greg in public comment.\nSpeaker 5: John Music Mrazek. I hope happiness. Right?\n",

Item 15, please.\nSpeaker 0: Item 15 is a communication from Vice Mayor Richardson recommendation to receive and file a presentation from Philosophy on National Poetry Month and Direct Department of Library Services to partner with the Arts Council of Long Beach to prepare an update on the Youth Poet Laureate Program.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. The month of April is National Poetry Month, and we're taking today as an opportunity to recognize poetry and also to have an update and receive an update on our Youth Poet Laureate program. Arts is an incredible part of our community.\nSpeaker 4: It's a, you know, something that brings us all together. And we've been incredibly supportive of arts through murals and performing arts and a whole host of things. And what we're seeing here is, oh, I have the clicker. There it is.\nSpeaker 4: Fantastic. Okay, great. So National Poetry Month is something that is a program that was established in 1996 by the Academy of American Poets. It's an opportunity to celebrate the impeccable body of literature created by poets. It acknowledges the wealth of humor and humor, human emotion found in poetry.\nSpeaker 4: And the it was approved by we brought the Youth Poet Laureate program to City Council back in 2019. I brought it forward along with Councilmember Urunga, Councilmember Andrews and Councilmember Pearce, and the goal was to capture the essence of our city, inspire creativity and all residents, bring literary arts to all, to people who may have limited access\nSpeaker 4: or few opportunities to to poetry or expressive writing and enhance the city's current literacy and arts program and overall to uplift, cultivate and celebrate the youth voice. The program was initially stood up and the idea was to target kids 14 to 19, and they were encouraged to apply and submit poems throughout the city.\nSpeaker 4: We went through an initial first year where 30 teens were invited to perform at public events. It was set to launch. The full program was set to launch in 2020, but then we were impacted by COVID 19, and so we thought it would be a good opportunity to now bring it back and has staff to take another\nSpeaker 4: look at how we can make sure that, you know, we continue this incredible program that that really was was stopped short due to COVID 19. According to library staff, the plan is to bring is to have the program up and running by January 2023.\nSpeaker 4: And I want to support that effort. I think our city council should support staff in that effort to get this program back up and running. So this recommendation is. Today we're celebrating National Poetry Month, but also sort of reaffirming our commitment to making sure that poet poetry is accessible to all.\nSpeaker 4: And that's sort of the idea of the president of the the motion today. And at this point, I want to invite up philosophy. There is I want to divide up philosophy. Philosophy. He's a good friend, a Long Beach poet, grew up in North Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: His entire family, he's he went to Hamilton Middle School, Jordan High School in Long Beach State. And he's well regarded as a leading poet, not only just here in Long Beach, but around the nation, as we've been highlighted in, you know, verses and Flow Def Poetry Jam.\nSpeaker 4: And he's a North Long Beach guy and a good friend. And so, without further ado, I handed over to philosophy.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, everyone. Doing tonight. Thank you for such an opportunity to speak on the artistry that we have here in Long Beach. Coming from North Long Beach. It's one of those things that we are I am rooted in this city and being able to hold that flag all over the world and saying poems.\nSpeaker 6: And people say, where are you from? Not Long Beach. So that being said, I'll delve right into this poem. Through the Youth Poet Laureate program. We are planting seeds of strength in our communities, tending to the soil of our youth, cultivating their mentality with mentors and placing their fingers in the enriched soil of creativity.\nSpeaker 6: We are watering the seeds of their success, growing competence, teaching tenacity, and engaging young leaders to express themselves for healing and resolution. Raise your pen and write from the epicenter of your truth. Write for healing. Write until the silence becomes tears.\nSpeaker 6: Write until tears become smiles. Write from the core of your being. Be the voice for the voiceless. And listen and listening ear for hearts that are not heard. We have our thumb pulse on the rib cage of society, pulsing with every smile, teardrop, laughter or hugging of loved ones.\nSpeaker 6: We are harvesting the spoils of their hard work with integrity and a positive attitude. The children are the catalysts to change. They blossom as the stem of a sunflower, illuminating their lives as a guiding light or lighthouse, guiding ships to the shore of their success, floating on an ocean of opportunity at the telescope, seeking the horizon and\nSpeaker 6: morning sun. We are birthing the vision of a new generation. We are steadfast in the fortitude of our beliefs. We believe in kindness, compassion, love, literary arts, dance, dedication to the craft, and never failing to be a beacon of truth.\nSpeaker 6: We are honest and deeply rooted in Long Beach. We sidestep obstacles and find freedom at the edge of a pen or pilot. Gita. We shoot for the stars as supernovas in the night sky. We write with artistry and expression as a rose through concrete, pushing its petals through the cement.\nSpeaker 6: We are resilient as using our thorns to break ground. The lower yet program is ground breaking. It will change the landscape of the literary arts and Long Beach. It is a charging forward. It is spearheading the charge. It will create literary spaces of free thought for our youth.\nSpeaker 6: And plant seeds of success for their future. So bring forth the laureates. It is their time to lead. I am philosophy. And I thank you humbly for this time with you.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. That satisfies our presentation. Again, we you know, we're coming out of the pandemic and we need to make sure that we get back to where we where we were and and make sure that this youthful program gets the support that it needs.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 7: Yes, I'm happy to second this motion and always move. Then touched by the artistry and the great words of our good friend, dear friend philosophy. He said A lot of powerful words in there, but I caught on to a few.\nSpeaker 7: And is that there? Was that. That that concept of free thought, which is the antithesis of groupthink. And I think we could all learn from that, particularly as public officials, that we are able to think for ourselves and have free thought and not necessarily subscribe to the thought that everyone else wants us to.\nSpeaker 7: We don't talk on talking points. Thank you for your presentation, sir.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman in the house.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, philosophy. You know, I am one of your biggest fans. I remember when we first met. Your words just inspired me so much. And I continued to be inspired by your so very powerful and sincere words.\nSpeaker 1: One of the things that I love about you is your focus on the youth and giving them the opportunity to find their own voices and really make a difference in not only here in Long Beach, but everywhere. So I got to say, when I saw you on the agenda, I got really excited and I even contemplated writing\nSpeaker 1: a poem for you. But I don't know that it's going to be as good as what you write. But I know that I continued to be inspired by you, and I thank you for that. And I thank you for all that you do for the city of Long Beach and putting us on the map.\nSpeaker 1: And you continuously do that. And I will continuously be a big fan of yours. Thank you so much for your powerful words and for your love for this city and our youth.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman Sara.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I want to thank Vice Mayor for bringing this forward and what an important program that we need to bring forward and to update given our recovery process. And I think that our young people have so much to express and there needs to be an outlet and a way to shape their identity and and find their place\nSpeaker 2: and to lift up Long Beach altogether. So look forward to hearing back about the program when it comes back in philosophy. I love your shoes. Where can I buy a pair? Seriously, I need it in pink, though.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. We have a motion and a second. I don't believe there's any additional public comment.\nSpeaker 5: If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item 15, please line up at the podium in the zoom. Please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine now. See none. That concludes public comment.\nSpeaker 3: Members roll call vote.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Sun has. Councilwoman Allen i.

We know that there's an outstanding issue of diversity, and this is an organization that has a lot of power over determining what officers we get.\nSpeaker 2: And they have screened out many candidates of color in the past and have historically not had therapists of color on staff doing the screening. And so want to make sure that it's on everybody's radar.

No. Motion carries and the appointments are confirmed. These are either part of the Gender Equity Safe Communities and New Americans Committee.\nSpeaker 6: The Report of the Gender Equity So Communities and New Americans Committee General 12 Cancel 118904 relating to appropriations for the Seattle Information Technology Department and many audience 125207, which adopted the 2017 budget, lifting a proviso in ratifying confirming certain prior acts.\nSpeaker 6: The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks very much, Councilmember Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Council Bill 118904 effectively lifts a budget proviso that was documented in Green Sheet 2071b1 2017 concerning some additional need for a community engagement prior to the release of funds for the Seattle Police Department to move forward with its procurement and operation of a department wide program related to body worn video, commonly referred to as body\nSpeaker 6: cameras. Just really quickly, as a refresher around what the conditions of the proviso were that that were imposed upon the department, I just wanted to run through the four components that were documented in that 2017 proviso that were approved by this body.\nSpeaker 6: In our last budget cycle, the proviso had four parts to be completed by February 1st of 2017 by the Seattle Police Department. In conjunction with and in consultation with the Community Police Commission, one SPD had to reconvene. The Stakeholder Work Group formed the prior year 2005.\nSpeaker 6: And excuse me, 2016 ents and they needed to seek out their advice regarding any outstanding issues or community concerns related to body worn camera protocols and policies to speed in consultation with the stakeholder work group and Council needed to develop a detailed action plan for community engagement on body worn video by December 2nd, 2016, that included a\nSpeaker 6: plan for regularly sharing with my committee a status update on community engagement efforts. Three. Speedy needed to submit to the Council a final report that summarized the results of the Department's community outreach that would describe how the draft body worn video policy would was responsive to community input and the operational needs of the department.\nSpeaker 6: And the report also needed to identify any unresolved questions or issues related to the body worn video policy and implementation protocols. And lastly, the Department was required to document how it would continue to engage and seek the advice of the stakeholder work group on the use and deployment of body worn video equipment in a sustainable manner well\nSpeaker 6: into the future of the deployment of this new technology into our community. So before us today is and before my committee last week was a consideration of whether or not the 127 page report submitted by the police department to full council in my committee was effectively in compliance with those four different criteria that were articulated in the\nSpeaker 6: 2007 2017 proviso. After deliberation, the committee determined that the the the requirements of that proviso were met. I do want to note that we heard in public comment both at committee and here today and have received some email correspondence related to what the what I think could be confusion as to what the proviso was intended to do\nSpeaker 6: versus what it wasn't intended to do. And I just want to be really clear that the proviso clearly was a requirement and a directive to the police department to engage in additional community outreach, which I think at the end result had been approximately two years worth of community engagement.\nSpeaker 6: I'm not saying that it was an entire two years worth of community engagement. It was certainly in fits and starts, I would say. But the proviso was not intended to relitigate the issue as to whether the city should or should not pursue the body worn video program.\nSpeaker 6: And I wanted to be really clear, is the drafter in the generator of that proviso that the intent of the proviso was to make sure that as as the city moves towards deployment of body worn cameras into our community, that it was being done so in a manner that was informed by impacted communities.\nSpeaker 6: So that that, I think, is what the actual intent was. And I just wanted to say that given that the the committee recommends that the full council approve the ordinance lifting the body worn video proviso and before I end my comments in hand and answer any questions or open up the floor for others to add their comments\nSpeaker 6: , I just wanted to add that in public comment. Again, both in committee and here, we've heard a lot about about whether or not body cameras are desired within our community. And I just wanted to point out to a report that was issued just last year that was commissioned by the Federal Monitor, by the city of Seattle, to\nSpeaker 6: take a look at not just community confidence, particularly within communities of color, but also looked at where people were at in terms of their receptiveness to wanting body cameras here. And I'll just read the final conclusion from the report which says, quote, Seattleites overwhelmingly want to see body cameras on their officers.\nSpeaker 6: This is almost universally popular, 92% support, 5% oppose like it was in 2015, in which 89% support, 7% oppose. It's again impossible to find a statistically significant population in this city who supports this by any less than 80%.\nSpeaker 6: This is similar to the 87% of people who think it's a good idea nationally, according to Pew Research's December 2014 poll. Close quote. So I think the challenge before the department and the challenge before this council is to thread the needle and strike that balance as much as we can between operational needs and legitimate, reasonable policy concerns\nSpeaker 6: that have been expressed by a variety of stakeholders, including the department. And I think that right now what we have before us is, is a policy that has that striving to do that it is currently being considered by the.\nSpeaker 6: It will monitor and I believe will have a result or reaction from the federal monitor in early March. So with that being said, I just wanted to lay that out and assure folks who have concerns that this is an iterative process, that we will continue to look at the implementation and deployment of this particular technology in our\nSpeaker 6: community, and that that will be done in a transparent way, primarily by virtue of having quarterly reports in my committee. And I've gotten assurances from the department that to the extent that there are increases in use of force in the field after the point for deployment, that there will be an opportunity to revisit this and consider suspending\nSpeaker 6: the program.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Gonzalez. Any further comments? Councilmember O'Brien.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Councilmember Gonzales, I appreciate your work on this in the Dow lining and where we are today. I'm going to be voting against this and I want to just walk through where my concerns stem from. So be clear on that.\nSpeaker 4: I think it starts from the general concern that I think folks share is the balance between these cameras. Are they going to be used for surveillance or are they going to be used for police accountability? And there's no doubt that a camera could be used for both.\nSpeaker 4: But how we set up a policy that ensures that the predominant preponderance of the work done here is to achieve the police accountability outcomes that I believe we're all working for and to be careful that the surveillance aspects of it, to the extent that they exist, are done in a way that are consistent with our commitment, ongoing\nSpeaker 4: commitment to privacy. I do believe that the the the folks in charge at the police department are trying really hard to get this right. It's a challenging it's a challenging effort to balance this. And yet when I look at where we are today, I feel like there's some work that needs to be done before we proceed to\nSpeaker 4: a full deployment citywide. I want to say that I trust our police department, that they're intense and all my work with them, I believe that their intent is outstanding. But that said, I don't believe it's appropriate to pass policies based on my personal trust with the people who happen to be in charge at the moment.\nSpeaker 4: I think it's critically important that we have policies that hold up under any set of people that are occupying different positions. And specifically, my concern is around the amount of discretion that officers, I believe, will continue to have.\nSpeaker 4: In light of the report that came out. And what that discretion may mean. I believe folks have seen the New York Times article that talked in detail about what's happening here in our city around police body cameras from I believe it's from last October.\nSpeaker 4: There's a data piece in there that it's important to repeat. I know folks here have heard it, but when referring to a study by Ariel and Sutherland, it found that police use of force actually went up by an astonishing 71% when officers to turn on their camera, to turn their cameras on or off at will and went\nSpeaker 4: down by 37% only when they recorded nearly every interaction with public from start to finish. That's one data point, but it's a pretty big data point with a pretty big spread of outcomes depending on how this can be implemented.\nSpeaker 4: And so when I look at the I'm specifically looking at attachment F to the report and under Section five, where will Seattle fall following that? Is it a place, a system where they're intended to record every interaction or when they can turn them on and off at will?\nSpeaker 4: And it's hard for me to tell, frankly, when I'm looking under Section five, see discretion in recording. It starts off by saying that employee is acting in good faith. To exercise discretion in this policy will not be subject to discipline for the decision to record or not record.\nSpeaker 4: That's a pretty big caveat that I think carves out, like, hey, as long as you're trying, we're going to give you a fair amount of leeway. And that feels like it's pretty broad. Then when we look at some of the areas where folks have discretion, there may be a odd circumstance.\nSpeaker 4: I'm looking at five F here. There may be limited circumstances when respect for an individual's privacy or dignity outweighs the need to record an event when skipping to the bottom. When an employee believes such a circumstance exists. Employee may deactivate the body worn camera.\nSpeaker 4: I won't go into detail to repeating this, but there's numerous places where there's a lot of discretion, and it's hard for me to figure out how we will enforce those rules and say, was it appropriate use of discretion or not?\nSpeaker 4: And then we come back to the caveat, well, as long as they're acting in good faith, we're not going to discipline them. It feels like I worry that we are going too far in the direction of the of the study where folks, police officers, will have a significant amount of discretion to turn on and off the cameras\nSpeaker 4: at will. So my one issue is with the Seattle Police Department, not, again, their intent. I believe they're trying very hard on a very challenging thing, on a challenging issue. But I'd like to see more work around that.\nSpeaker 4: I also have concerns about other levels of government and how that interacts with our ability to implement a law that if it were just up to Seattle, I think we could do much better. Specifically around states, public records, disclosure rules.\nSpeaker 4: We've heard that there is an effort, an ongoing effort to change these. But that's an effort that's out of our control. I mean, we will certainly weigh in on that and lobby and have in the past. It's not clear to me that we're significantly closer to resolving that, and there's no certainty that we will resolve it in\nSpeaker 4: a way that meets our needs. I appreciate that. In the the police department's response to the ACLU's letter, they highlight that if things don't go the direction we want them to go, that they would certainly be opening to revisit this.\nSpeaker 4: But I think that ultimately highlights the uncertainty around it. And finally, setting this, the police department in the state aside, I have serious concerns about federal government's use of data, concerns that frankly, even two weeks ago, I don't know that I would have felt as strongly about we will be collecting immense amounts of data on people in\nSpeaker 4: our community. And I don't see any way at the moment how we can shield the federal government from having unfettered access to that one way or the other. And when we have a federal government that is doing things like having immigration agents, board domestic airlines to check IDs of everyone on board, it causes me grave concern about\nSpeaker 4: what this amount of data on people in our city being well, not willingly handed over, being made available because we have no alternative to the federal government does. And again, the urgency of moving forward on accountability is important to me, but weighed against these other factors.\nSpeaker 4: My preference would be to not deploy body camera citywide at this time and take a little more time to both see what evolves at the state and federal government and work on our policies internally to see if we can do a better job to eliminate some of that discretion.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Bryant. Any further comments? Council members. Back then customer accounts from the question, but yours are just questions. Okay. We'd like to answer it now or later. Okay. Customers want.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, President Harrow. I wanted to thank the. Public Defenders Association, the ACLU, the NAACP and the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Washington State for not only testifying, but also specifically talking to the NAACP and the ACLU for engaging with my office as we sought clarification of many of these questions that were emerging as Councilmember O'BRIEN You\nSpeaker 2: know, one went over many of them. I think the council members who are advocating for this particular ordinance have cited the support for BODYCAMS and the consent decree and made the case that it's an important part of police accountability reforms.\nSpeaker 2: But that is the question that emerges in my mind. Will these cameras be used for police accountability, or will they be used to increase warrantless surveillance of all our communities, particularly our immigrant and black communities who are systematically targeted by law enforcement agencies around the country.\nSpeaker 2: I think John Gardner, own of the ACLU, posed that question quite well in his email to council last Wednesday. He said, and I quote, A policy geared towards surveillance and prosecutions looks very different from one geared towards accountability.\nSpeaker 2: We should not ignore data that suggests rolling out cameras with the wrong rules may lead to an increase in violence and may decrease community trust in law enforcement at a time when the trust is particularly fragile. It is for this reason that simply rolling out cameras with the stated intent to adjust the policy on the fly is\nSpeaker 2: not a cost free decision. And Gordon and Gordon Brown had a really good quote that was in The New York Times about the some of the information we have. So what policy has the SBT put in place for the deployment of body cams?\nSpeaker 2: Well, the fact that discretion for turning the cameras on and off and control over what happens with the footage is fundamentally in control of the speed. Makes it clear to me that this policy cannot, despite intent, be primarily designed to be a tool for accountability.\nSpeaker 2: For accountability. There is to be some other independent agency whose mission is accountability of the speed and who are empowered to make those decisions. Otherwise, it's simply a case of the fox guarding the henhouse. Brian Massey, the chief operations officer of the LAPD, was here year, sent this letter.\nSpeaker 2: To all council members except for me objecting to the ACLU opposition to their body cam policy. My office will get into the serious failure of communication from a city department or city council member leader. But for today, I would like to focus on the substance of his letter.\nSpeaker 2: Brian Maxey admits, quote, The policy does not allow officers discretion to turn the cameras on and off under specific circumstances, but is not nearly as nefarious as the ACLU letter suggests, unquote. I have to ask, how can this be an effective accountability tool if officers have that discretion in the first place?\nSpeaker 2: He goes on to concede that, quote, The federal government can request and receive data from the department, unquote, but justifies this by saying that, quote, the speedy currently audio and video records the same sort of events that the current body worn cameras policy instructs officers to capture.\nSpeaker 2: The department has almost a petabyte of ICB information, unquote. And by the way, what is a better bite? I don't know. And I think I know a lot about that stuff, but I don't know what a petabyte is.\nSpeaker 2: But I would like to quote Sean Garner own again, who said that as to privacy, body cameras record far more video in far more places, including the interior of buildings than in-car videos. So it is disingenuous to suggest that simply because SBT currently audio and video recorders the same sort of events, the body cameras would also have\nSpeaker 2: the same rules apply. Also additionally in the the newest letter from the ACLU talks about a specific concern, I think that should be highlighted. The potential result is that body camera footage, combined with the availability of that footage to the federal government and with facial recognition searches could compromise an individual's immigration status in direct contravention to our\nSpeaker 2: city's status as a welcoming city. For example, day laborers often gather in the parking lot of Home Depot in West Seattle, which is located next to the Speedy West Precinct, with officers wearing body cameras. Recordings showing the faces of those individuals would be open for the federal government to run facial recognition searches, possibly triggering deportation actions.\nSpeaker 2: I don't think these these concerns should be taken lightly, especially at a time when Trump is a Donald Trump has made it very clear his administration is going to systematically go after a whole host of immigrants, not just as he claims, you know, criminal immigrants with criminal records.\nSpeaker 2: I think this is of a great concern. And I think that given all of the concerns that have been raised by the various organizations, I will have to vote no on this legislation.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Council members want. Any further comments from any of my cast cast members?\nSpeaker 2: QUESTION And Councilmember Gonzales, maybe you can address this because I was with you in the committee last week after the committee, Reverend Walden, someone who we all know and has been very engaged in the CPC, said to me that she felt that we had not addressed how we were going to protect people in domestic violence situations, that\nSpeaker 2: their faces, if the cameras are on, could be a problem. I wonder if that's something that you can address if right now if we could ask for clarification at another time. So I appreciate hearing a little bit because I really want to make sure that people are protected in those situations and that they can call and feel\nSpeaker 2: that they will their privacy will be protected and retained throughout.\nSpeaker 5: If if.\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 5: If it's okay with Councilmember Banks, I'll answer that question in my comments if that's acceptable. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmembers speak now.\nSpeaker 5: Yes, thank you. So body worn video is another step toward greater transparency of policing in Seattle. And as Councilmember Gonzales has accurately relayed, our action today lifts a proviso that allows these cameras to be distributed to more officers.\nSpeaker 5: Beyond the initial pilot, which was conducted last year in the East Precinct and then the equipping of our downtown bicycle officers at the beginning of this year. But a video and audio recording is not new to the police department.\nSpeaker 5: It goes back 12 years. In December of 2005, the police department first began using in-car videos, often referred to as dash cam videos. And they were deployed then in 2006. And today, all uniformed, deficient divisions of Speedy are equipped with the in-car video systems for recording, video and audio.\nSpeaker 5: The patrol officers. Traffic officers. Gang Unit. SWAT team. The only uniform. Unit that does not have the in-car video systems or motorcycle traffic officers. The in-car video system or dashcam videos are required to be turned on by officers any time an officer takes law enforcement action, including street stops like Terry stops on the street.\nSpeaker 5: Any time they arrive at a location of a dispatched call. And once they turn them on, the in-car video cannot be turned off according to a state statute. If an officer has not manually turned on the in-car video system, it automatically comes on when the officer activates their emergency lights or their siren.\nSpeaker 5: In addition to in-car video systems, our detectives commonly record interviews with witnesses and crime suspects. Now I want to address this issue of discretion. And it's interesting when we read selectively from the policy that that guides the use of body worn videos, it's it's actually quite explicit.\nSpeaker 5: Section five B lists when employees are expected to use the body worn videos. Dispatched calls are very similar to the in-car video system. Traffic in Terry stops, same as in car video. On view infractions and criminal activity. Same as in car video.\nSpeaker 5: Arrests and seizures. Same as in car video searches and inventories of vehicles, persons or premises. Sometimes that's the same as in-car video. Sometimes it's not. Transportation of individuals in their cars. Vehicle pursuits or chasing of criminal suspects. And questioning of victims, suspects and witnesses unless the individual does not want to be recorded.\nSpeaker 5: But even if an individual tells an officer, I don't want you to use your body worn video to record me, the officer cannot turn off their in-car video, so the audio from that is still going to be recorded.\nSpeaker 5: And if they're within visual range of the in-car video system, that will be video recorded as well. Officers do have some limited discretion. They can turn off their body worn videos in bathrooms inside of jails. Interiors of medical, mental health counseling or therapeutic facilities.\nSpeaker 5: Unless they're engaged in a direct law enforcement purpose, such as viewing a crime in progress, they're also required to ask consent before they record inside of a private residence. If a person denies consent, they still have to notify that person that the audio is still going to be recorded because of the in-car video system that will be\nSpeaker 5: running. Even though the video may not be available. They're also allowed to protect the privacy and dignity of individuals. And it lists in the section that Councilmember O'Brien read it. It explains where officers may be able to make that kind of a discretionary call.\nSpeaker 5: At natural death scenes. When they're giving a death notification. Child assault victims or sexual assault victims? Cultural or religious objections to being recorded. And where use of the body worn video would impede or limit the cooperation of victims or witnesses.\nSpeaker 5: It's been suggested that. We shouldn't approve this continued expansion of. Body worn videos because it is not limited just to police officer accountability that it could be used for collection of evidence. This is an issue that the Washington legislature considered last year in 2016 and soundly rejected any notion that these videos could only be used for officer\nSpeaker 5: discretion and could not be used as evidence of criminal activity. If we were to pursue a policy that would say we could only use these videos for officer accountability, we would be saying to our police officers, we can use this body worn evidence against you if you engage in misconduct, but we cannot use it against the individual\nSpeaker 5: who may assault you. And that's just a crazy idea. So I think we should continue with the. Distribution of the body worn videos. It is sound policing policy. It is supported by the American Civil Liberties Union nationally. It is supported by police reform advocates across our country.\nSpeaker 5: And it's used in literally hundreds and hundreds of police departments around the United States, including 40 or 50 right here in Washington State.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Burgess. Excuse me. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? Well, I guess I'll just say a few. And that is the very simple issue in front of us, is whether the terms of the proviso have been listed.\nSpeaker 0: As Councilmember Gonzalez pointed out, number one, have convened a stakeholder group of the number two developed a title Action Plan for Community Engagement. Have they issued a final report summarizing that work? And it was indeed a lengthy report.\nSpeaker 0: And have they documented how they will continue to engage and seek the advice of a stakeholder workgroups? And I think under undisputedly my mind, they have complied with the letter of that proviso, and I'm certainly supporting the lifting of the proviso for those reasons.\nSpeaker 0: It's always sort of a natural. I suppose. Inclination to get caught up in the pros and the cons of body cameras to begin with. And I respect the opinions that we heard from some of those opposing today and certainly not new objections and very respectful objections.\nSpeaker 0: But in 2017, I think we are living in a country and in a city where video technology has changed the landscape of this country. That had it not been for video recordings throughout this country, we would not be having probably probably the intense both demonstrations and intense focus on what is happening to particularly African-Americans.\nSpeaker 0: But many people who have unfortunately suffered at the. At the hands of police officers. In 2016, over 250 African-Americans were killed by police officers. Not not all unjustified, but these are staggering numbers when you look at what's happening without body cameras.\nSpeaker 0: Look at our criminal justice system. We have a lot of data that would support. And I have all of the citations that. African-Americans are clearly arrested, as we know, at six times the rate of white people in our country, that a black person is 3.7 times likely to be arrested for marijuana possession, when in fact the usage\nSpeaker 0: in these groups between blacks and whites are the same. African-American drivers are about 31% more likely to be pulled over than a white driver. Black drivers are three times more likely than white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop.\nSpeaker 0: That is our criminal justice system in this country. And while I'm not suggesting that. Body cameras will do away with this institutionalized. Injustice. What I am suggesting is that there's already a record of what's happening out there in the field.\nSpeaker 0: The record is what an officer records on his or her report. What I am personally looking for, and I've been looking for since 2010, when I discovered the advent of body of camera technology, is objective evidence and a record, if you will, of what's happening.\nSpeaker 0: And this concern that the ACLU expressed that violence would go would could possibly go up. Is completely inconsistent with the statistics where body cameras are put in place. We have over 50 cities in the state where body cameras are already in place.\nSpeaker 0: We have over a thousand police departments in this country where body cameras are in place. A study in Rialto, California, which is a very statistically valid study that was done and very in-depth study, clearly showed that the use of force.\nSpeaker 0: Against people dealing with the police had gone down 60%. People tend to act differently and often times more responsibly when they know they are being recorded. And this argument that the cameras must be on at all times, and we are concerned that officers have discretion to turn them off, and therefore the answer is to keep them off\nSpeaker 0: . That to me is entirely inconsistent. That. The office. We already know that officers have incredible discretion in what they're already doing. And again, we have countless examples in this country that justice would not seen even closely the light of day had it not been for body cameras.\nSpeaker 0: And so while certainly it is not the end all to be all in terms of the issues dealing with us, I think it provides one more tool, again, to let us evaluate what's happening in the field such that we can learn.\nSpeaker 0: And together the police department is a learning organization and the city is a learning organization can learn from the deployment of this technology. And as I said earlier, we're sort of getting behind this. Technology is evolving. These policies will change.\nSpeaker 0: And again, to me, we have to begin the deployment such that we can learn and improve and modify the policies. Last. I'd also say that. Council bill rather House Bill 2362 there was an Olympia very recently, you know, which deals with of course, to the costs associated with archiving and the costs associated with public disclosure request had\nSpeaker 0: several other aspects. On the use of body cams as well. And there was a lot of talk in Olympia about that process. And I'll just read one letter that was written by Reverend Walden and cosigned by many organizations, including the representatives from the Philip Randolph Institute Seattle chapter from Partner for Youth Achievement, Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church\nSpeaker 0: and others Mothers for Police Accountability. But they clearly said in this letter that. That people of color were involved in the process of drafting House Bill 2362 and that the city of Seattle had already convened a process. I got to tell you, I attended on March.\nSpeaker 0: On March on January 19th, I believe it was the African-American Police Advisory Council, January 19th, where this matter was discussed. I've had debates at the University of Washington. I've had legislative districts where they've endorsed use of body cams.\nSpeaker 0: As Councilmember Gonzales said, there were several polls or or surveys taken where this is overwhelmingly supported by the public. So I think it's time to actually deploy it. The technology continues to grow the community on modifying the policies as we see.\nSpeaker 0: But again, this sort of endless process of that, we seem to get stalled. I think it's time to move on. Okay. Well, let's wrap up. I think we're trying to vote. Please call the role on the passage of the Bill O'Brien.\nSpeaker 4: I know it's. You got a record. I know. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: So aren't they. Hi, Burgess. Hi, Gonzalez. Johnson. Whereas I. President Herrell I. Five in favor, two opposed.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. The bill passed and Cheryl signed it.

So our next proclamation and last proclamation is the art and wine fair. This is the 35th anniversary of the Alameda Art and Wine Fair.\nSpeaker 0: So who's that? I see. Janet Maccabee, executive director of downtown Alameda Business Association. So come on now. Here's your proclamation. Where is the first? Alameda Art and Wine Fair was held 35 years ago on August three and four in 1984.\nSpeaker 0: And. Whereas, the event continues to be the largest street festival on the island, staffed by 200 volunteers each year, a total of 7000 volunteers and over 14000 hours of service over the past 35 years. And. Whereas, the event is co-produced by the downtown Alameda Business Association, Daubert, its board of Directors and member businesses and strum productions to\nSpeaker 0: raise funds to keep downtown Alameda clean, green and safe. And. Whereas, the event provides an opportunity for thousands of visitors and residents to discover our vibrant downtown districts, celebrate the creativity of Northern California artisans and sample locally crafted beer, wine and food.\nSpeaker 0: And. Whereas, more than 200 bands have performed live over the years and a local stage was added in 2018 to highlight Alameda based performers. And. WHEREAS, the event offers family friendly entertainment, including a Ferris wheel, bungee jump, water balls, kiddy train and puppet show.\nSpeaker 0: And. Whereas, to celebrate the 35th anniversary Dover will hold, will host a free showing of every poster from the fair's 35 year history collection at the Auto Body Fine Art Gallery on Park Street from July 17 to 28, 2019.\nSpeaker 0: So now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Marilyn, as the Ashcroft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim July 27 and 28 as the Art and Wine Fair's 35th anniversary in the city of Alameda and congratulate the downtown Alameda Business Association on their continued success and invite Alameda INS and visitors to enjoy the 2019 Art\nSpeaker 0: and Wine Fair. And with that, Ms.. Maccabee, would you like to say a few words?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, thank you. Madam Mayor, councilmembers and city staff. Thank you for acknowledging that. Acknowledging the 35th anniversary of the art and wine fair in historic downtown Alameda, the downtown Alameda Business Association Board of Directors, Board, committee staff and our event partner Equestrian Productions are most grateful for the years of support that this council and the many that\nSpeaker 3: have gone before have given. We are equally thankful for the support of the dedicated city staff, including but not limited to our police and fire departments. Permits and planning, public works, economic development as each have assisted us with the details necessary to pull off this major event.\nSpeaker 3: Many of you have volunteered and your time and your talents and you've stood by local residents that have also helped our loyal sponsors and community partners that have helped to fund this undertaking. Share this honor with our association.\nSpeaker 3: We'd like to acknowledge our downtown businesses who roll out the welcome mat for tens of thousands of people every time we put this event on. And so we are ever grateful to them for their hospitality. I hope you can all be there on the 27th and 28th.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: But difficult. I know you don't think congratulations like married.\nSpeaker 9: There were some issue with ABC which.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Next step is oral communications where we have a limited number of speakers may address the counsel regarding any matter not on the agenda and we have 15 minutes set aside for that and any additional public comment that doesn't happen in those 15 minutes will happen later in the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: So do we have any speakers?\nSpeaker 1: We have three.\nSpeaker 0: Three. So with three speakers you will each get 3 minutes. You never have to feel like you have to use all 3 minutes. But any. Would you want to call our speakers?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. Pat Potter Mackenzie. Tap and simmer.\nSpeaker 3: You don't know how tempted I am to continue my conversation on the car, but I won't.\nSpeaker 0: I'm not on the agenda.\nSpeaker 3: It's not on me anyway. I just wanted to point out that that the impression I got from that incredibly great city comment meeting at the Elks Lodge about carp was so well attended and the ideas were so fantastic.\nSpeaker 3: But the one thing I took away was that most people hadn't read the document. They wanted to tell you what they felt about climate and and that sort of thing, but they hadn't read the document, or they may have read the executive summary.\nSpeaker 3: And the reason is, is because this document is so heavy. I mean, it's so big. So what I'd like to suggest is that that every time you have a plan, when it's a draft, you make five copies of it, you give it to the library.\n",

If you don't mind, in the back. We're going to get started.\nSpeaker 5: We all say.\nSpeaker 2: It. Excuse me, David. It looks like you have a really adorable baby back there. But if you don't mind, we're going to get started.\nSpeaker 6: Tony Massaro.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Speakers should begin their remarks by telling the council their names and cities of residents and if they feel comfortable doing so, their home addresses. If you are here to answer questions only when your name is called, come to the podium, state your name and note that you are available for questions of council speakers.\nSpeaker 2: 12 3 minutes. Unless another speaker has yielded his or her time, which would result in a total of 6 minutes on the presentation monitor. On the wall you will see your time counting down. Speakers must stay on topic of the hearing and must direct their comments to the council members.\nSpeaker 2: Please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to council as a whole and refrain from individual or personal attacks. Councilman Cashman, will you please put Council Bill 1034 on the floor? Thank you, Mr. President. I move the council bill 1034 we placed upon final consideration and do pass.\nSpeaker 2: It has been moved and seconded the public hearing for Council Bill 1034 is open. May we have a staff report?\nSpeaker 6: Good evening. Theresa is Sarah with community planning and Development. This is a map amendment rezoning application for 1209 north of Perry Street. The proposed proposal is to rezone from general urban multi-unit, three storey and urban edge to unit to general urban residential mixed use five storeys.\nSpeaker 6: So the property is in Council District three in the West Colfax neighborhood, just north of the Perry Street Station and the Lakewood Dry Gulch Park, three blocks south of West Colfax Avenue, four blocks north of West Sixth Avenue.\nSpeaker 6: Property is about a quarter of an acre or 11,300 square feet. It is currently vacant. The property owner is requesting the rezoning to prepare the property for redevelopment. So again, the request is to rezone from general urban multi-unit three stories and urban edge two unit to general urban residential mixed use five stories.\nSpeaker 6: So the general urban context is characterized by multi-unit residential in a variety of building forms. Low scale commercial imbedded in residential areas. Residential uses primarily located on collectors or local streets. Generally in a grid street pattern. So again general urban multi-unit three stories and urban edge to unit C which is a 6000 square foot lot vacant property\nSpeaker 6: surrounding buildings scale of 1 to 2 stories. And on this map I'm not sure you can see well, but there's a darker orange. Those are three properties that are under site plan review for taking advantage of the M3 zoning and building townhomes or a triplex on the smaller property.\nSpeaker 6: So we're already seeing redevelopment on this block. Existing zoning general urban multi-unit three storey and urban edge two unit on three sides of the property and south is urban edge two unit. This gives you a little bit of a flavor of the context.\nSpeaker 6: Property itself is vacant. To the right is the house just north of the property. And then to the right. Lower right is the property across Perry Street. Then, of course, lower left is the Perry Street Station. And then a property across the alley on the upper left.\nSpeaker 6: Most of them. One or two stories, as we said. So informational notice on this went out to all of the registered neighborhood organizations in the area, as well as City Council on August 25th to notify everyone that we had an application that was complete.\nSpeaker 6: There was a planning board hearing held on October 19th where planning board voted 10 to 0 to recommend approval of this application. And the application did go to the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on November 8th and was passed on to this body.\nSpeaker 6: And I'm going to take a drink because my thoughts getting dry. And you see here the list of the rhinos that were notified. The West Colfax Association of Neighbors, Sloan's Lake Citizens Group, Villa Park, Neighborhood Association, Denver Neighborhood Association and Inter-Government and Inter Neighborhood Cooperation.\nSpeaker 6: Today we have three letters of support that were attached to your staff report. So you know the criteria well, consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, furthering the public health, safety and welfare, justifying circumstances and consistency with neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent.\nSpeaker 6: The plans that apply our current plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and the West Colfax Plan that was adopted in 2006. So comprehensive plan 2000 tells us to protect our air quality by expanding the use of transit and increasing the mix of uses within our neighborhoods to encourage mixed use transit oriented development to determine the potential for transit oriented\nSpeaker 6: development in our station areas in particular, and encourage such opportunities where it is possible. Blueprint. Denver The land use concept is urban residential, a higher density and primarily residential concept, but does include some complementary commercial uses. The property itself is an area of stability and an area of change.\nSpeaker 6: It was an area of change. And then the RTD right of way to the south was all an area of stability. And then the alley got relocated to the north of the property. And so we ended up with a little bit of area of stability mixed with the area of change because the blueprint Denver map wasn't changed\nSpeaker 6: when the alley was relocated. So the street classifications are Perry Street is a main street collector and 12th Avenue is designated local collectors balance, mobility and the land use. So the West Colfax Plan of 2006 has a framework plan that has future land uses and urban design districts.\nSpeaker 6: And this is the section of the plan that speaks to future rezonings of property, and it does designate this property as urban neighborhood station that should be located. These areas are located within a half, half to a quarter mile of the light rail stations.\nSpeaker 6: And these the plan says these areas should be single family or multifamily at a scale of 1 to 5 stories. Also in the plan is the concept of growth opportunity, areas that were sort of like areas of change and areas of stability.\nSpeaker 6: And this property was designated a growth opportunity area where existing housing stock is dated and declining and it might be appropriate to redevelop the area. And this just shows you that urban neighborhood station designation from the West Colfax plan and this is the showing you the residential growth opportunity area.\nSpeaker 6: It's a little hard to read, but the the red properties are that residential growth opportunity. The other thing that this map shows is multi-modal green streets, which Perry Street happens to be one where the plan talks about beefing up the urban design and the multi-modal use of this street.\nSpeaker 6: It's important because it connects to Colfax and it connects to the St Anthony's redevelopment. So the land use recommendations out of the West Colfax plan are to recommend higher density for housing diversification and higher density in strategic locations like station areas, main streets and town centers, and to support infill development and mixed use projects and says the\nSpeaker 6: plan says these are especially appropriate at town centers along Main Streets and in close proximity to transit stops. The West Colfax Plan also designates the area in district plans where it talks about the character of the area and talks about in that section of the plan redeveloping the edges of Villa Park and the West Colfax neighborhood.\nSpeaker 6: So this just shows you the designation of the Pleasant Hill Station in the West Colfax Plan with that staff believes that this application conforms with all of the plans and furthers the uniform uniformity of district regulations. By going to a standard zone district that's not custom.\nSpeaker 6: That will have the same rules throughout the city for that zone district and furthers the public health, safety and welfare by implementing the city's plans. Justifying circumstances, its changed conditions, the land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to a degree that it's in the public interest to encourage redevelopment of the area.\nSpeaker 6: CPD believes this criteria is met. There is major investment in this area with the light rail. Metro White Light Rail. Redevelopment of St Anthony's within a half mile are the Knox and Perry Street stations. So this area is definitely undergoing change.\nSpeaker 6: So we believe there is. Correct. Justifying circumstances. There is changing conditions. And we did talk a little bit about the general urban neighborhood context, multi-unit, residential and a variety of building forms. Low scale commercial embedded within residential areas.\nSpeaker 6: Commercial uses in a variety of building forms. The X5 is intended to promote safe, active, pedestrian, scaled, diverse areas and activating the public realm. The mixed use residential mixed use zone district. You can have ground storey retail, but you can't have upper storey retail.\nSpeaker 6: You only are allowed lodging or residential uses in the upper storeys and you can also have a strictly commercial building. But if you have a strictly commercial building over 10,000 square feet, I mean strictly commercial building, then you're only allowed a building of 10,000 square feet in that zone district.\nSpeaker 6: And there is only one. Building form allowed and that's the shopfront building for. So staff believes that the g r x5 is the appropriate zone district for this property and. And staff recommends approval.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. We have two individuals signed up to speak this evening. First up, we have Bruce O'Donnell.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President, of members of the council. My name is Bruce O'Donnell, and my address is 386 Emerson Street in Denver. And I'm delighted to be your last matter of business this year. And before you everybody gets out for the holidays, I am not going to repeat Theresa's entire presentation.\nSpeaker 9: I'll try to be brief. I do want to point out that we did have good community engagement with two RINO's, as Theresa said, and have positive community input and feedback in support of the application. This is in a blueprint Denver area of change and in the West Colfax plan.\nSpeaker 9: This calls for tod type redevelopment with five storey heights and hundred percent lot coverage, which is exactly what the proposal on the District of gr5 accomplishes. This zone, district and this rezoning were initiated prior to the moratorium on the slot home form, specifically because this on the street would make it almost impossible to do that with the\nSpeaker 9: transparency requirements and the build tos and so forth. And so if that is in your mind at all tonight, this is being done because it's consistent with the moratorium and you're thinking on precluding that building for them. I also am available to answer any questions this evening.\nSpeaker 9: Should you have any? But consistent with the staff recommendation for approval and Planning Board's recommendation for approval. I requested City Council approved MAT in the amendment application 2016 i00026 rezoning 1209 Perry Street to grx5. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Next up, David Roybal.\nSpeaker 5: Hello. Good evening, counsel. Thank you for the honor to speak names. David Roy Bach, Star Citizen, a large 21 or seven cell. Jason Street, born and raised in this area, went to Lake Middle School. This area means a lot to me of the tragedy that we happened that we had there.\nSpeaker 5: Which are we lost? I went to school with the Mother Lake. It's a part of the Midwest. We we used to have a time we used to have a studio there. It was called Time Council Studio, and we had a store three blocks away.\nSpeaker 5: So when it says General, General Urban, mixed use, I just hope it's an area that can serve the community and it's something that I want to pay attention to. And I hope constituents on Channel eight are paying attention to of the first rezoning on on the south side of Colfax.\nSpeaker 5: You know, we already know what happened already on the other side of of Colfax by Lake Middle School. It's a neighborhood I don't know. I don't even know. I grew up there, but I don't look like it. So I just want to be real cautious.\nSpeaker 5: If this is the first rezoning that's going to start pushing into the West Side that is affecting all of Villa Park because Villa Park actually goes all the way through the whole Lakewood Gulch. And I've been part of the eminent domain, the light rail, since 2007, and I've seen the long, hard battles that was fought for the\nSpeaker 5: property along there. So it's kind of overdue to see a rezoning there after the light rail. It's a huge transit area from the light rail. Kids walk to there from lake a lot of kids it's a kid access to go to school the nine bus so I just hope that it's something that's good and doesn't change it\nSpeaker 5: and I just sort to know how they reached out to the Jewish community because that is a huge part of Jewish Denver that's still there, been there for hundreds of years, at least 125 years. And I just speak in support of this, that it's going to help strengthen the community and not bring any gentrification and divide the\nSpeaker 5: west side. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. All right, Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 5: Theresa, quick question. Is the e utu c a protected zone district. It is.\nSpeaker 6: But in this case, there is an intervening right of way. And so.\nSpeaker 5: And we move that right away to the north of the property.\nSpeaker 6: But there's still some left now.\nSpeaker 5: So the E2 C is on the south border where the train track is.\nSpeaker 6: Yes. And there's some right of way there between the station and the property.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Okay. So enough to.\nSpeaker 6: Separate the separate. And so the protected district has no effect.\nSpeaker 5: Great. Because that's that's where I was going with that as I was hoping that we were in a upper story setback situation on the south side of this building. So you're just confirming that that is not the case?\nSpeaker 6: That is not the case.\nSpeaker 5: Wonderful. Thanks. No further questions.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman, because we know. All right. The public hearing for counsel, Bill 1034 is closed. Comments by members of council and council. Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. This particular rezoning started pretty early on. It makes one you know, I was very happy with the the community outreach that took place. As you see, one of the neighborhood associations had signed off on it and they didn't get any letters of opposition from either Villa Park or West Colfax.\nSpeaker 7: We can see it kind of speaks for itself, the fact that it's right on 12th and Perrier, where the light rail station is, this is exactly the kind of density that calls for. It is that area of change.\nSpeaker 7: But when you when you see where that station is, it's important that that we're able to increase the amount of units and availability for folks to be able to use that light rail station. Otherwise, as a light rail station, it goes through a single family neighborhood.\nSpeaker 7: And when you look at the West Colfax plan, when you look at the Villa Park plan, a little parks and older plan, it doesn't account for the library or not the library outside the light rail station. But when you go to that West Colfax plan to the north, it does talk about that particular area picking up.\nSpeaker 7: And when you look at blueprints, you know, long standing call for area of change in that area. This is what it is. You know, back in 2010 when we did the citywide rezoning, you know, we knew that, you know, the opportunity would come where we would actually see more increased development that really utilizes that the West Line\nSpeaker 7: and to be able to see, you know, this become a little bit tighter of his own district and find out I think it's a. It's a plus for the community. So you know that we have no opposition. I don't have any opposition to this particular rezoning.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 5: I just want to thank the applicant for moving forward with our x five because of the shopfront form. I think we can sort of at least your architecture can turn the corner. I hope that it does and address that.\nSpeaker 5: The Gulch and it does provide some ground for activation if you choose to if the opportunity is there. So hopefully you're open to tell what Mr. Roybal is saying and see if there's any need in the community. But I recognize that once the zoning is in place, it could be 100% residential.\nSpeaker 5: And so it goes. At least here's a place where the form based zoning code may get it right. We'll see. But that was it. That's all. I do like this as a zoned district in this sort of context, more so than some of the other ones we've allowed thus far.\nSpeaker 5: Thanks.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman. Seeing no other comments, madam secretary.\nSpeaker 4: Raquel Lopez. I knew Ortega i black.\nSpeaker 3: Eye.\nSpeaker 4: Espinosa.

        "source": "Speaker 5: Thank you. And Devin. It looks like he's not here. We will move on to the next item on the agenda. Item 26.\nSpeaker 0: Item 26 is a communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Peers, Council member, soup owner and vice mayor. Andrew's recommendation to require city manager to work with staff to conduct a curb evaluation in parking impacted neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 5: Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 2: So this is an item that is at this point narrowly tailored to impact neighborhoods that are parking impacted. And what we want to do is just take a look at our read curves. We're not looking to shorten red curbs or cause any traffic safety hazards as a result of shortening red curbs.\nSpeaker 2: But we do have some red curbs that really could be evaluated in terms of whether we still need them there, whether they need to be as long as they are. And we think that we can recoup some additional parking spaces if we have the opportunity to conduct a red curb audit in parking impacted neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 2: I know that where we have a parking impacted neighborhood, being able to get an additional spot or two on a street makes a huge difference for the business corridors and for the multifamily residences that are usually located in those parking area parking impacted areas.\nSpeaker 2: We also want to look proactively at how we can try to find efficiencies with our current parking configurations in parking impacted neighborhoods. So having our team out there looking at the red curves, evaluating where we can make some changes will hopefully lead to additional recommendations that we can implement in the future.\nSpeaker 2: I urge my colleagues to support this item that is very much in demand in parking impacted neighborhoods. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 8: Yes, I want to say I support this in concept. I know whenever I first got into office, my staff person, Melton was in the field every single day, auditing every single block we possibly could. I think out of the entire second district, what we were able to get were seven parking spots by shortening curbs, at least out\nSpeaker 8: of the most parking impacted area. So I support this in theory. I look forward to hearing from staff on cost and recognizing that it's a big undertaking but vitiate any effort to add more parking where it's safe. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Coulson, for super now.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you again. Vice Mayor Andrews apologizes for not being here tonight, but he asked me to read this statement. I would like to thank Councilwoman Price for bringing this item forward because I too have concerns for my residents as it relates to red curbs.\nSpeaker 9: It seems like recently we're making these curbs longer in places where we are heavily impacted and the impacted areas on our map also seems to be outdated in district six. Anything west of Long Beach Boulevard is congested. Where I live, we miss the impacted zone by just a few blocks, but we too are struggling to find parking\nSpeaker 9: . It amazes me that the permit parking districts that are already established are not even in the impacted areas. My neighborhoods like Wrigley Historic District have both literally and figuratively been driving in circles to find parking. I look forward to I look forward for a path in the right direction.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. And I want to thank Councilmember Pryce and the rest of the council members for bringing this forward. This is obviously a challenge for our entire city, and I wish I could have signed on as well, because we do have some park in impacted areas as well.\nSpeaker 6: I'm sure that city staff will be be cautious and do their due diligence as they're doing this study. There's also a concern that recently came up from from some of my constituents and neighbors regarding the visibility at the intersections as it relates to red curbs.\nSpeaker 6: And so I would please take that into consideration as you were moving forward with your study, but I'm happy to support this item.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you is core. Leslie, please come forward for public comment.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. With respect to the read curves, parking is definitely an issue in many parts of Long Beach. I spent almost half an hour trying to find a parking place down on Broadway a couple of Saturdays ago. My good luck.\nSpeaker 4: We'll get you a parking place in some of those areas. I am concerned, however, about losing line of sight at corners if red curbs are removed. The real solutions we should be looking at is that is to focus on getting builders to install adequate parking.\nSpeaker 4: It is the height of foolishness to do road diets and eliminate parking requirements when the population is multiplying and we are putting up higher density residential and business structures. Please do not relax. Parking requirements. If we do that, we are only benefiting developers, not the community.\nSpeaker 4: We failed to construct a useful public transportation system in L.A. County, Orange County and Long Beach in the 1960s, when it should have been done. We won't be able to cut back on cars, so we need parking. But the real answer is not red curbs.\nSpeaker 4: It's making sure that we require it in our zoning. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. That concludes public comment that I signed up. I know you. You didn't know you had to sign up currently, so please speak.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I agree with everything that Carlos just said. I am concerned about. The elimination of view viewing at an intersection by eliminating the red curbs. What was the purpose of painting the curb red of an intersection if it wasn't so that people could see what was coming?\nSpeaker 4: I also agree with her on. The. Issue of demanding that builders developers put in more parking in their. Developments. I talked to a contractor and he said, we put in what the city requires. If they required more, we would put in more.\nSpeaker 4: Just last week, I was at a planning commission meeting where they're building an eight storey and a 23 storey building on third and Pacific. Maybe it was 21 storeys. I know it's big. There is only going to be one.\nSpeaker 4: Parking place for each unit. This is ridiculous. Everybody has two cars now and some have very many more than that if they have teenagers. This is replacing a city parking lot. And there's no parking on the streets. So that's what you should be looking at to find more parking.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 2: You and I just want to clarify a few points because I'm not sure if everybody was reading the same item. We're not looking to remove any red curbs, and we are not looking to jeopardize the public safety by creating traffic hazards.\nSpeaker 2: This item is directing our traffic engineers to take a look and conduct an audit. And for those who have complained about different things that traffic engineers have done to slow traffic and comment, I think we can all agree that safety is at the forefront of their minds.\nSpeaker 2: So I look forward to hearing back from them on what the results of their audit shows and again, jeopardizing public safety and traffic safety is not at all any part of this item. And should that be a reality, we certainly won't make any changes.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. There's a motion in a second. Please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 0: Ocean carries.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 3: Agenda item 11 Resolution 318 30 Building to the Move Seattle Levy Establishing Principles for developing a revised work plan for MOVE Seattle Levee Projects to ensure transparency, accountability and thoughtful community outreach, the committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember O'Brien, you may introduce I'm aware there may be an amendment to this, so I'll turn the floor to Councilmember O'Brien to introduce it.\nSpeaker 2: Sounds great. So as folks are aware, the a couple of things have changed since the vote passed the move Seattle levee. One is we have a new federal administration and as a result, we are concerned about not being able to get the same type of federal matching grants for transit projects that we originally had hoped for when\nSpeaker 2: we passed it. We've also seen a lot of construction in this town driving up price for construction, and so the costs of some projects have increased. This is a cause. Seattle Department of Transportation need to step back and do a deep evaluation of the levee projects that were proposed in the nine year levee when voters passed it\nSpeaker 2: and evaluate if they had if they need to make any changes that add to meet the current budget. But this resolution does is it establishes some principles for the department transportation. As they evaluate those changes and the requests following those principles, they come back to us by a committee meeting in early December with what any recommendation, any\nSpeaker 2: recommended changes they want to make to that plan. So we have a chance to review that and see how it goes forward. We had good discussion in committee, made a few changes to this legislation, but ready to move forward.\nSpeaker 2: And Councilmember Herbold discussed a change that would help coordinate with Seattle Public Utilities. The amendment wasn't ripe in committee, but it is. Right now. So I'll turn it over to Councilman Herbold. Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: So much. To get us started, I move to amend Resolution 31, 83 zero by adding a new subsection one H, a new Section three and Re numbering the section numbers accordingly as presented in the distributed amendment.\nSpeaker 2: Second.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. So this amendment asks escort to coordinate with SPU to take into consideration the impact on SPU projects and ask for an initial assessment by December 1st and a final report no longer, no later than March 1st, 2019.\nSpeaker 4: This is because one of the questions that was asked during briefings this morning is why? Why focus on SPU? What about the other departments? Well, we learned through the strategic business plan discussions earlier this year that that these.\nSpeaker 0: Projects.\nSpeaker 4: That are associated with the levy are a significant cost driver of rate increases. And largely, it's because these kinds of projects, because they're underground, they are very expensive. And so there's 150.\nSpeaker 0: Million in must do projects associated with SPU.\nSpeaker 4: Related to levee projects and another 49 million in what they call opportunity projects. It just makes sense to do them while the streets are open to do the Levy project. And so it's I think it's really important for this.\nSpeaker 0: Council to have a more.\nSpeaker 4: Clear understanding not only how.\nSpeaker 0: SPU projects will be affected by the new prioritization of of MOVE Levy projects.\nSpeaker 4: But also how those changes might affect SPU customer rates.\nSpeaker 1: Very good. We're going to vote on just the amendment. Any other comments about the amendment pertaining to the SVU piece? Okay. So we're going to vote on the amendment first. All those in favor of the amendment, please vote.\nSpeaker 1: I oppose. The ayes have it. So, Councilman Brandies, you want to say anything on the amendment based legislation? Any other closing remarks on the legislation and the resolution?\nSpeaker 2: I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 1: That's former skater.\nSpeaker 5: I know everybody wants to get out of here. I just want to say thanks to Councilmember O'Brien for his leadership on this. I'm hoping that as we reset the Seattle or move Seattle investments, that we are going to be able to do so in a way that truly prioritizes improving safety and flow for all users, but particularly\nSpeaker 5: in light of the conversations that you have helped to lead in the last few months here, that we are specifically focused on pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders, and that we evaluate where projects may have been put on hold like the streetcar, how we can make sure that we're expediting opportunities to get people moving throughout the city.\nSpeaker 5: And I look forward to the report back and seeing a path forward to make sure that our invested investments in transit are meeting our values of both environmental protection and transit mobility. So I'm looking forward to working with you on that.\nSpeaker 5: I thought of a few amendments at the last minute where I, I think that those would better be reserved for another day. So I'd love to work with you on those. And, Mr. President, I wasn't going to do this earlier, but I'm gonna do it now.\nSpeaker 5: I just want to say thank you to all of our staff. It's been an intense week as we all worked on various resolutions and prepared for our normal council activities. So I just want to take a quick moment to say thank you to my staff, especially Michael Maddox and Sage, who worked on the EMT and shoebox issues\nSpeaker 5: . And also to Patricia Lee, who I didn't get a chance to thank earlier from central staff who worked on the EMT resolution specifically. It's been a long week and we're closing it up so I won't take any more time, but to say thank you to the good sponsor of this legislation.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks for mentioning those great folks. We appreciate.\nSpeaker 2: That. And it's been a long week and it's only 430 on Monday. So.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Councilmember Gonzalez, thank you.\nSpeaker 4: I just wanted to ask a question on this, since I didn't have the benefit of attending the Sustainability and Transportation Committee where this resolution was discussed. And I had just a sidebar conversation with Councilmember Herbold about the implications on the budget, which were about budget process, which we're about to undergo, and how the resolution interplays with any\nSpeaker 4: decisions that we may be considering during the budget related to transportation investments via the Muse Move. Seattle Levy And perhaps you can just highlight that for us before we we called us for a vote.\nSpeaker 2: So there's a lot of things moving here and I'll I'll take a just a couple minutes to walk through some the various parts. So there's a levy oversight committee that's been in place since the levy was passed and since the department announced that they were going to be evaluating all the different pieces of this levy, that Levy\nSpeaker 2: Oversight Committee has met, I think, a couple of times a month, and I'm part of that to go through a bunch of the programs. I think there are I can remember about 30 different programs that are part of the levy.\nSpeaker 2: 22 of those my number is not quite right, but about most of them are on track even when we've done some high level analysis to kind of meet the objectives. But their aid programs, they wanted to take a deeper dove out.\nSpeaker 2: And so they've gone with the oversight committee into a deep dove on all of those. Now, the Oversight Committee includes members of the pedestrian advisory board, the Bicycle Advisory Board and the Transit Advisory Board. And those advisory boards all went into deep dives on pieces of the levy.\nSpeaker 2: Look at their programs. The Levy Oversight Committee is having another meeting at the end of the next week or the following week where they will make a final set of kind of recommendations in a letter that we will be receiving from them in addition to this resolution.\nSpeaker 2: And then the motor boards will all receive in September, my committee will receive on behalf of the Motor Board's updated implementation plans for the Transit Master Plan, the bike master plan and the pedestrian master plan in September. And those are the five year implementation plans that we entered.\nSpeaker 2: We redo every single year to add an additional year at the end, but also show what are the priorities. And those plans will be very integrated with the investments in Seattle and other city investments in the transportation projects that are moving forward.\nSpeaker 2: This this resolution was largely designed just to lay out a framework as they're working through this. And to be clear, a lot of this work has already been done on how we want the department to make its final evaluation and select how they're going to prioritize which set of projects.\nSpeaker 2: There are some places where they've been able to figure out creative ways that we can still build, you know, the sidewalk blocks that we had proposed. We're going to kind of change some of maybe some of the sequencing of it, but we can still meet it.\nSpeaker 2: There's some places specifically around transit where they're probably going to say, we can't do the full. The scope of everything we wanted to do. But here's how we're going to. Here's what we think we can do in the sequencing of it.\nSpeaker 2: And this resolution is intended to say, look, when you when you look at, for instance, transit, we really want to prioritize speed and reliability of transit operations as you're making those investments. So keep that in mind as you set your priorities.\nSpeaker 2: But there will be future opportunities, including the implementation plan updates, which will come to us about a month from now. And then we'll come back with a final set of recommendations that will be driven by budget. Of course, that will be post-budget in December to talk about that, too.\nSpeaker 4: I appreciate that additional detail. As we head into the budget season, I just am reminded that oftentimes we receive many notes of advocacy and advocating from members of the community, particularly those who are very interested in seeing the fall in robust implementation of the city's commitment to Vision Zero.\nSpeaker 4: And I just want to make sure that we are taking into consideration the realities in trying to figure out how to thread the needle in this area with the move Seattle Levy that that in some instances is the appropriate revenue source for the things that folks are asking us to support in the budget process and the move\nSpeaker 4: Seattle Lovely Levy is one of the few dedicated revenue streams of revenue that we have to be able to meet some of the transportation issues that I think a lot of us hear from our constituents. So I would appreciate continuing to have an opportunity to engage, to sort of figure out how we're going to piece all that\nSpeaker 4: together as we head into the budget. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Any further comments? If not those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended, please vote i. I. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries and the resolution is adopted. Cheryl, sign it. Is there any further business giving for the council?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, there is. Agenda item 12.\nSpeaker 1: Item 12. Oh my.

Thank you very much, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Collins. Item. Item number four on today's agenda. We talked about quite a bit this morning. This is related to the federal grants that we are accepting. There's a number of important federal grants that are accepted at the end of the year each year.\nSpeaker 0: There has been a document that was circulated this weekend by Greg Doss from central staff. And we appreciate all of the work that they did over the weekend to help answer questions that stemmed from the robust discussion in our committee meeting on Wednesday.\nSpeaker 0: One of the things that you should also note, in addition to the questions that we have submitted that resulted in 11 page response document, is that Director Noble has sent a letter today to make sure that if there are any additional questions that those get answered before those 2021 allocations are spent.\nSpeaker 0: And that's an important commitment from the CBO office, from Director Noble, that he has sent this letter to us, which you all should have received just around 2 p.m. today, to make sure that any additional questions specifically as well related to Homeland Security grants do get answered.\nSpeaker 0: As the council member, Strauss discussed this morning. There was a long conversation in Wednesday on Wednesday's meeting, and I do have additional concerns and questions that I will be submitting. Folks are asked by Alex Nucci and Greg Doss that if you do have additional questions that are not yet answered in that 11 page document, please make sure\nSpeaker 0: that you send your questions by Wednesday at noon so that central staff can coordinate with the office to answer any additional questions. I want to make sure, though, as Vice-Chair Herbal did during our committee last year, that folks know that there's a number of really important grants that are included in the overall bill as well, and we\nSpeaker 0: want to make sure to move this forward to accept those grants.

Councilmember Strauss and then Councilor, you want to go to Councilmember first? Okay. Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Strauss.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I also want to make note of Budget Director Ben Noble's commitment in the Budget Committee meeting to do more work with the Council prior to the the development and submittal of grants that may be of concern to the Council.\nSpeaker 2: An example of the work that this Council has done around funding sources that are of concern relates specifically to legislation in 2017 that the Council adopted. You might remember that that year I proposed to create a new section of the municipal code prohibiting Seattle Police Department participation in the U.S. Department of Defense 1033 program that allows cities\nSpeaker 2: to transfer excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies at no cost. This was a particular program that we had received concerns about, and in response, we, the chief, had had decided to no longer participate in that program.\nSpeaker 2: And then we sort of solidified that policy decision of of of chief best with this with this particular ordinance, I would suggest that our ongoing efforts to take a look at some of these grant sources might result in a request from the council to the department to no longer participate in in some of these grant sources.\nSpeaker 2: But I think that is really important work, and I appreciate that that we need to do moving forward. And I appreciate that we have a commitment from the Budget Director that we can take a deeper dove in the future before these grants are sought.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, excellent. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Strauss.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Chairman Skater. And thank you. Also Chair Herbold. Also want to thank Director Noble for your letter. Your letter, as well as the conversation that I had with Greg Doss and Alex Nucci, have resolved the concerns that I have for today.\nSpeaker 1: And I will be following up with additional questions as per your letter has requested. I really just want to thank you, Director Noble, for sending that along and working with us in an expedient fashion as well. Again, a thank you to Dr. Fisher and Angela Sochi and Greg, for all of your work answering the 11 pages of\nSpeaker 1: questions over the weekend. Thank you, council president. I will be voting yes. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Now way to bury the lead counselor with Strauss. Thank you so much. Colleagues, are there any additional comments on the bill? Right.

Recommendation to refer to the government personnel and Elections Committee. To consider naming of the newly renovated North Health Facility, the Ronald Arias Health Equity Center, in recognition of the legacy, contributions and service of former Long Beach Director of Health and Human Services, Ronald Arias.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Let's get this over to Vice Mayor Richardson.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to just start by talking to a little bit of story history about the North health facility. This is a facility at Highland Park, not a great name, north health facility, used to have a youth child development center in there that closed years ago.\nSpeaker 6: The building was failing. Not a lot of investment in the building. And and so two years ago, we closed down the building, identified resources through grants and other sources to improve the facility. And it's a great opportunity to to engage in placemaking, I believe, in taking something that really didn't have an identity or not much of an\nSpeaker 6: identity and give it a location, give it a name. Given that identity that really reflects our community and becomes a place to be invested in and celebrating. We've done this with changing the North Library to the Michelle Obama Library, the Highland Park Community Center, the Doorstops, the other community center.\nSpeaker 6: It really gives an identity and character to help inspire the community. And so during that time, we had conversations about how we reinvent, reimagine Highland Park in general from just being a collection of buildings to really a complex that really celebrates the people of our community and offer current services to that community.\nSpeaker 6: And so in response to meetings calls, a major $5 million investment was made into the Highland Park, into the north health facility. And the focus is really health equity. And within our framework for reconciliation, reconciliation plan, go for strategy one.\nSpeaker 6: One potential added item is the need to invest in equitable health experiences and outcomes and exploring the creation of a community health center that connects existing programs and organizations as a network for holistic health approaches and patient navigation services.\nSpeaker 6: Ronald Arias Health Equity Center will be that center, and so this new center will feature a youth workforce center that did not exist, that happened in the past that focuses on things like reentry. It will have a clinic focused on sexual health for the community.\nSpeaker 6: It will have youth development programs, violence prevention programs, fatherhood initiative. A number of things that we're not present at the park in the past, and this is going to be a transformative impact. And, you know, I met Ron.\nSpeaker 6: I think Ron is the appropriate person to name this facility. After I met Ron, my first year as chief of staff for Councilman Steve Neal, and Ron came in. I remember the briefing. He already had a relationship with Councilman the I don't know how long or how far back, but Ron came in.\nSpeaker 6: He brought in Lori Ruska, Shawna Stevens, who was like right and left hand. And I hadn't known them, but they came in and said, hey, we want to talk about health equity in North Long Beach Community Health. Initially, it started with healthy corner stores.\nSpeaker 6: We organized around healthy corner stores that turned into the Alcohol Nuisance Abatement Ordinance and liquor store modernization program. Change that transforming liquor stores into healthy markets that ultimately developed into the hills on initiative. Initially, $1,000,000 investment from Kaiser Permanente into advancing health equity.\nSpeaker 6: In North Long Beach, we created the Coalition for Healthy North Long Beach together. We did a lot. Ron's legacy was really community health, investing in local communities to spur transformational change because a lot came out of that initial investment.\nSpeaker 6: And so Ron has contributed so much over his career to our city's public health and to health equity. And for that reason, I believe Ron embodies the character and legacy befitting of someone whose name belongs on a city building, particularly at Highland Park in North Long Beach.\nSpeaker 6: And so with that, I submit to the City Council the proposal to make, to create, to name the North Health Facility, the Ron Arias Ronald Arias Health Equity Center. Thank you. Okay. Councilman Noriega.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. That was a. Awesome presentation in terms of what what you're doing out there. And of course, that facility has provided so much service in the north Long Beach area that is very much needed. Point of history.\nSpeaker 3: I when I worked with Sea Long Beach, I was the assistant, the administrative officer for the Health Department. So I used to go to that facility quite a bit to talk to employees and see the programs that were there.\nSpeaker 3: And the the black health the black infant health program was stationed out there. And so I would go out there a lot to talk to people, look at the kids, and the facility was in quite a bit of disrepair and a congratulations to you to getting the funding to make those very significant improvements.\nSpeaker 3: In regards to the naming of the round, our Audience Health Equity Center I think is very appropriate since Ron was the executive director for many years and I think it was around 15, 20 years that he was director of the health department there and was the main proponent for a lot of the programs that were there, a\nSpeaker 3: lot of the funding that came to the health department. For those of you out there who might not know, our health department is 95% grant funded. So there's very little actual city funds to grant general fund money that goes into the health department for the little programs that come out of there, whether it's in the in the\nSpeaker 3: facility center, there's a center also in Admiral in Admiral Kidd Park and one at a at a martin Luther King Park, MLK. So those those facilities provide a lot of different services as we go into the community. But the but the naming of this facility here in Ronald's name, I think is very appropriate in the sense that\nSpeaker 3: there's a lot of healthy programs that go out of that facility. And a brief resume on Ron is that he did have a lot to do with equity, a lot to do with employment for kids or youth, provided a lot of services in Long Beach in general.\nSpeaker 3: Even before he became the director of the Health and Human Services Department. He was one of the founders of the the La Raza Neighborhood Center, which was which then later became the UCC center. He was very much involved in, in, in tobacco education when he worked for the I was at the Cancer Society.\nSpeaker 3: I think it was forget the name the leaves me right now. But a lot of what he's done has been involved with health and involved with assistance for the community and working in neighborhoods that required a lot of a lot of help and a lot of assistance and a lot of grant funding which he was able to\nSpeaker 3: bring. And he brought it through the health department. So I'm very happy and pleased and honored actually to be able to second this motion and looking forward for it to go through the government personnel and Elections Committee for further consideration.\nSpeaker 3: And I'm sure that once they hear the complete background of Mr. Arias, there will be no question as to the appropriateness of naming this facility after after such a wonderful person, a great man for Long Beach. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, councilman and House.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. Thank you, Vice Mayor, for recognizing the importance of naming such a fitting project, such a fitting, you know, felt health center at heart at your park by the name of Ronald. Ah, yes. I think he is so perfect for this.\nSpeaker 2: He's been a leader in our community for so many years, and I think that projects like this really give us an opportunity to honor our Long Beach leaders. And Mr. Arias has definitely been that for our city as a whole.\nSpeaker 2: So I thank you and congratulate you at the same time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilwoman Sara.\nSpeaker 2: You Mayor. I also want to express what a good call this is, Vice Mayor, for naming this unit in our facility to the run areas health equity center. You know, speaking of his youth work, that's actually the first time I met Ron was probably back in 2000.\nSpeaker 2: I want to say eight or nine when I was the executive director of my Girls in Action. You know, me being a new ed and getting to know all of the various ways to work in partnership with the city, and here he was, the director of a department inviting me and my staff at that time to come\nSpeaker 2: and meet with his staff, all of the department directors. And it was just really, I think, a demonstration of how much he is a champion for ensuring that he includes young people as well as working with and partnership truly with everyone.\nSpeaker 2: So I just want to, you know, also thank council member Urunga and Sun House for signing on to this. And I think this is a great honor for him and I think overall for the community. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I just wanted to say a few words of support and just talk about that. When Ron brought forward solutions, they weren't always the easiest solutions. We really thought about comprehensive ways to reach out and go into the community, out to council members to find a way to make a long term difference.\nSpeaker 4: And I think that naming something after him because of the impact he made on the city is a really great move. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Last May, Richardson.\nSpeaker 6: Just before we go to public comment, just want to acknowledge this community letter. So I want to thank the public for this community letter organized by the steering committee. Honorable Steven Neal, Susanna Edmond, Mario Gonzalez, Jessica Quintana and Shanna Stephens.\nSpeaker 6: The steering committee and a total of 25 leaders, including former city managers, community leaders, every elected official in the north, the you know, that represents the area surrounding this, the center, our community members. And so I want to just acknowledge their support and thank you for sending that letter.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I know we have just got Quintana who has a comment and she just comes up and is going to say a few remarks. I think this is a very fitting tribute to someone that is really the the father of the modern health department that we have here at the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: And also just a mentor to so many people across the city, including myself. I'm very grateful that Ron led this health department with the passion for for the city that he did. I him and Phyllis are two of just the kindest, most generous people that we have.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm just very grateful to to both of them for their service to to our community. Ron Arias is not just really a legend in the health world. Sure. Locally, but also for the Latino community. He is someone of significant contributions.\nSpeaker 0: He, as a young student and as an activist, was raising issues for the Chicano and Latino community, as a as a young college student, as moving on as a as a health specialist, as an activist, ensuring that the city was meeting goals around equity when there weren't a lot of managers and folks in his and leading departments\nSpeaker 0: that were that were people of color and certainly Latinos at the time. And so I think Ron is a very loved in our community among all people. And and I'm really, I think touched that vice mayor, that you and the community in North Long Beach are active in getting this across the finish line.\nSpeaker 0: And we also gave Ron the key to the city not that long ago and well deserved for him and his family. And he's just a fantastic person. So I'm very, very happy to support this. And with that, Miss Quintana.\nSpeaker 4: Definitely. Thank you so much. Parker Garcia and city council members. And this is just I mean, on behalf of center chair in our board of.\nSpeaker 1: Directors.\nSpeaker 4: And the Latino community, we can't say enough about Ron. You know, definitely want to borrow that key to the city from him one day. But he's he's just been a champion in public health, among so many other things.\nSpeaker 4: You know, upon his retirement, Ron never retired. He continued to stay active, a diligent in the community serving on the Miller Health Foundation. He serves on our Latino Cultural Advisory Committee. Ron is as an advisor, you know, to all of our community organizations in the city.\nSpeaker 4: You know, he works diligently fundraising for the Rancho for the Assistance League. Yes. And he started the Latin managers professional organization because it does believe in education and really developing our young people to become in higher education and taking manager positions.\nSpeaker 4: So we're delighted. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. Definitely. You know, the North Long Beach area needs support and needs health and human services in the area. They have high needs, you know, as well as other areas in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you for having the opportunity to speak. And this is very, very just you know, we're all really excited for Ron and his family. And as you said, Mayor Garcia, they do a lot for this city. It should be the Ron and Phyllis Center, actually, because Phyllis is his pillar.\nSpeaker 4: She supports him so much. And so thank you so much. We truly appreciate this.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And with that, we have a motion and a second. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Item 13, please.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 1: Recommendation to a word contract. Oh, that's my recommendation. To reject all bids and authorize a call for bid for the demolition and cleanup of vacant apartment buildings located at Orion Street, West Tower Avenue and Stardust Place at Alameda Point member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 0: As you want.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Mr. Spencer? Yes. Hi, Miss Mercado. So, first, I want to thank staff for being so responsive to the city council, because these are indeed. And I wish my I had wouldn't do this because I can't put the staff report.\nSpeaker 4: But this is the. The demolition of the buildings that we were concerned with out of Alameda point. And I'm happy to see that we're going back to bid. I have just two questions. I'm all for this. I want us to move forward and approve this.\nSpeaker 4: But my first question, Mr. McConnell, is and maybe it's for Mr. Horn, too, because this is on the bids, if all the bids that were received the first time around, the four contractors who responded to our RFP were non-responsive in one way or another.\nSpeaker 4: What, if anything, will we do differently this time in issuing the RFP? So we avoid that outcome again.\nSpeaker 3: So the RFP. Oh, sorry. Hi, I'm Nanette Marcano and the Community Development Department. The the redraft of the of the bid package. It has much more specific language of what will disqualify you for from a bid. The bids came in kind of all over the map, and there were certain items that we wanted to disqualify an applicant\nSpeaker 3: for, but we wanted to make sure that it was something that it was very clear that they were going to be disqualified for. So we redrafted it. The city attorney's office went over it with a fine tooth comb.\nSpeaker 3: So we we feel pretty confident about this bid package.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to clarify, the RFP is request for proposal.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And so when it said in the staff report that the first bids received were non-responsive. Is that what this means? Non-responsive? Was it in one way or another? They didn't qualify.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So we did the bidding at the Public Works Department. Thank you for Bob.\nSpeaker 4: Handling all of so. So by nonresponsive, you meant they didn't meet all the criteria. And this time you've set it out more.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, non-responsive. And in a sense that the lowest bidder, which is the one we would normally go with, we we were super sensitive because, as you know, we've demolished some of these buildings in the past. And we actually had some contract problems with with the award that we did in the past because of disposal costs not\nSpeaker 3: included in the bid. So when we went back and asked some follow up questions, some of the bidders wanted to revise their bids. And so as we moved along with the bidders, we thought, let's just wipe the slate clean and try this again and be very clear on what we're requiring from them.\nSpeaker 0: Now, I want to clarify, staff is recommending that we reject all the bids.\nSpeaker 3: Reject all bids. We're prepared to issue the new bid call for bids tomorrow.\nSpeaker 4: Right. No, I saw that. And I and I like I said, I appreciate that. I support it. So then my only other question is. So these sites, as we know, have had multiple break ins. They've had squatters. And now we are going to assuming the contract is successfully put out to bid and we get that perfect contractor\nSpeaker 4: to work with us that we're going to be opening up and removing asbestos and other kinds of, you know, lead and other hazardous materials. How will we secure these buildings to make sure that during the course of the demolition and the cleanup and the, you know, the completion of this project, they are not broken into.\nSpeaker 4: Again.\nSpeaker 3: All of these apartments have been fenced. And so as we move forward with the demolition, we will be removing the fencing so we won't remove until we're ready to hit to go to the different apartment. So we will take it down in phases so that there won't ever be a time when they're opened and people can move\nSpeaker 3: into them because we're going to it will be a very rapid demolition because we're not we're not taking apart the different the we're watering it and taking it all down at one time. There's no deconstruction.\nSpeaker 4: But are you saying it could happen in the course of a day? Because I'm I'm not thinking it happens that fast. I did read the the bid proposal. And I do understand all the the precautions about watering the site down.\nSpeaker 4: And if wind is over 20 miles an hour, you know, to to not do the work or what have you. But but I'm I mean, some of those buildings weren't fenced. It's true. But some of them were. And and there were still folks who got in.\nSpeaker 4: Are we doing higher fences, something different, more patrolling?\nSpeaker 3: Oh, we definitely do more patrolling right now. But we we've cleaned out the site a lot a lot of the debris at the request of the mayor, a lot of the debris has been removed. And if you've been around there lately, I mean, they're there buildings that need to be demolished, but it's not a lot of trash\nSpeaker 3: or any of that stuff. And it has not. Cumulated because we do more patrols around that area. And so what we will be doing is some temporary fencing in the interim as we're taking things down. But we will increase the patrols.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. That's my concern that I just don't want to make it that attractive nuisance for people to come in. And I mean, it's pretty clear that people were staying there and doing all kinds of activities. And I do understand I was through those buildings and there was all kinds of junk in them, but they still are four\nSpeaker 4: walls and in some cases, a roof and and could be.\nSpeaker 3: In many cases, roof.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Yeah. So. Okay. We will look forward to hearing progress.\nSpeaker 3: Definitely. And we will to I'll take it under advisement to be a little to to to have the security do extra patrolling in the area as we're doing the demolition project.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. That that is that is and that and with that, I would move approval of this item.\nSpeaker 2: Back in.\nSpeaker 0: November.\nSpeaker 6: I still had a couple of questions. So thank you, Madam Mayor, and thank you for the presentation. This was the item that we decided we were going to loan 75,000 from the general fund. So I guess a two part question.\nSpeaker 6: You know, one is we can't get that 575,000 number and one of these bids is almost double that. I mean, are we anticipating that we're going to spend $1,000,000 on this or.\nSpeaker 3: I'm I would say that we're anticipating that the bids will come back and close to the second and third tier, near half a million dollars.\nSpeaker 6: And then I think it says there's no general fund impact. But, you know, we've decided to do this alone. Are the financials at a point where we know if the Alameda Point Fund can cover this or. We don't know that yet.\nSpeaker 3: We don't know yet. We are waiting for the results of the audit to know what our fund balance was from the previous year.\nSpeaker 6: But technically, we may have a general fund impact if. We spend more than the amount that that we have in the fund. So it might be.\nSpeaker 3: We'll know when we award the contract, when we come to you to award the contract, how we're going to pay for it into that will be in that document. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome.\nSpeaker 0: The questions or comments? We have a motion in a second. All those in favor.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 0: Motion carries unanimously. Thank you.

Recommendation to request the City Manager to work with South Coast Air Quality Management District to report on the impacts of the City of Paramount air quality to Long Beach residents.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember I'm sorry. Vice Mayor.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Here in Long Beach, we border a number of cities, and in the ninth district border, the cities of Paramount, Bellflower, Bellflower, Lakewood, Compton, and the community of Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated section of L.A. County.\nSpeaker 0: So issues commonly across across commonly cross city boundaries. What's important that we stay up to date on manner matters that can potentially impact our residents? Our request today focused on a recent air quality concern with businesses located in City of Paramount, which are both only about a half mile away from District nine Long Beach neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 0: In October 2016, the South Coast Air Quality Management District began investigating two metal processing facilities in the city of Paramount after detecting hexavalent chromium, a potentially cancer causing metal. And in the interests of transparency, we placed this motion on the agenda to request city staff to do our diligence and coordinate with HQ, M.D. and City Paramount to\nSpeaker 0: better understand any impacts that this incident has had on our Long Beach residents and their quality of life. So tonight we're beginning that conversation and that discussion and will ask city staff to come back to the City Council with their full findings after engaging HQ, M.D. So we'll start with a brief staff report in a few questions\nSpeaker 0: now.\nSpeaker 2: Diana Chang, our manager of Government Affairs. I can talk a little bit about this item.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor, Council and mayor. We are aware that there are concerns that the City of Paramount and accused have around their metal.\nSpeaker 5: Facilities without.\nSpeaker 3: Getting into too much detail on on.\nSpeaker 5: The findings that a Camden Paramount have been.\nSpeaker 3: Discovering. We are willing and interested in working with the Air Quality Management District and our neighbors on figuring out any impacts to Northampton and the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And I just have a few questions, Miss Mustang two, and I would hope that the responses could be included in whatever report comes back. I'd like to better understand what hexavalent hexavalent chromium is. I'd like to know the difference between a regular metal shop and the ones that have hexavalent chromium emissions.\nSpeaker 0: I know that we have Weber Metals here in Long Beach and Paramount and a number of metal shops that are not necessarily hexavalent chromium emission emitters. And so we want to understand the difference between those two and understand where they where they are that are in Long Beach and close to Long Beach.\nSpeaker 0: So we want to understand that and we want to confirm and maybe you can answer this for us now, who is the lead agency that does evaluate potential potential impacts of air quality of businesses that surround Long Beach?\nSpeaker 3: Sure. So the US EPA establishes health based air quality standards that all states must achieve. And in California, the California Clean Air Act also establishes requirements for cities and counties to meet.\nSpeaker 5: It is the company's responsibility for developing plans and regulations to.\nSpeaker 3: Achieve these public health standards by reducing emissions from business and industry. So and it appears that ACME is is the lead on this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And we have already engaged them, correct?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, that is correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And so when do we anticipate to have some report of the findings of that discussion back to city council?\nSpeaker 3: We think we can have something back to you in about 45 days.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Have we spoken with the City of Paramount as well?\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Our office has been in contact with the city manager's office and Paramount.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So and so in 45 days, we'll have a report back. And can that include potential next steps if we do find that there is some impact along beach neighborhoods? Yes, certainly. Well, thank you very much. And so that's my motion to come back in 45 days with a report.\nSpeaker 4: Any other accounts, comments, seen, any public accounts of your anger?\nSpeaker 2: I want to I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. I know how equality is important to his neighborhoods as it is in mine. So I'm glad that you're bringing this forward and I strongly support it.\nSpeaker 4: Katie, public comment CNN. Okay. We'll go ahead and do the this motion for this for this report. Then with consensus, no objection.

        "source": "Speaker 0: Yes. Thank you. So I'll go ahead and jump in. So there's a variety of factors that determine user fees for the Recreation and Parks Department fee schedule. These include rising costs for staff, contractual services, utilities, and we always are trying to balance these increasing fees with market demand.\nSpeaker 0: So to do this, we compare with other local cities such as San Leandro, Emeryville, Fremont, Union City, and we also do comparison specific comparisons with local on island organizations and facilities such as Girls Inc for afterschool programs and local large rental facilities such as the Elks Lodge, Oakland Yacht Club, Eagle Hall and local gyms as well.\nSpeaker 0: So this year we worked there's there's not nearly as many fee increases as know. We're very we're very sparse with our fee increases as we really understand that due to the pandemic, we recognize the economic impact it's had on so many people, especially people of color.\nSpeaker 0: And so for and to ensure continued equity, we're also we wanted to really keep that at a minimum of our fee increases. And we're also working separately to increase our efforts to provide financial assistance across all our programs, both making it easier to apply and providing more funding.\nSpeaker 0: So and this, this 21, 2021 fee schedule before you was unanimously recommended as presented by the Recreation and Parks Commission. Next slide, please.\nSpeaker 5: Get.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. So this is a cost recovery model that we always build our fees based on. And the overall how it works is at the top of the pyramid, you have the individual benefits, what we call the high cost recovery program.\nSpeaker 0: So these are programs that are designed for individual benefit, that are optional, participate in they, and therefore people are asked to pay a more premium price for that opportunity to participate in these programs, such as adults, sports facility rentals and highly specialized summer camps.\nSpeaker 0: The ones in the middle are considered net cost recovery, so those will basically cover their costs or have a small profit. And their programs are designed for larger groups or multiple groups that pay for the opportunity to participate in a program.\nSpeaker 0: But but we want to make sure it's covering the costs. So to make it as affordable as possible to as many as we can. Those are things such as our classes and our summer camps, our afterschool programs, our tiny top programs.\nSpeaker 0: And then we have the bottom, the most broad, low to no cost recovery. And these the cost of these are offset in part by the the the the ones at the top where we are making more of a profit.\nSpeaker 0: And these programs are free or low cost and they're designed for as many people as possible to access often those that are economically disadvantaged. And these are our include programs such as our mastic senior center programs are park free parks and playgrounds that we really here at LAPD.\nSpeaker 0: We really value everyone in our community and recognize that not everyone has the capacity to pay fees. And we are one of the few remaining recreation departments, really the only one that I know of in our local area that still provides this free programing for youth through parks and playgrounds where they're at the parks, six parks every\nSpeaker 0: day after school and at five parks during the summers. For the last five years, we've also had the Free Park Baseball Summer program and they are completely free and continue to be so based on city council support and for the summer baseball program, also sponsorship from the Elks Club.\nSpeaker 0: And also I always like to point out that every park site has at least one picnic area that's free, first come, first serve. So, so we, we try and make sure we're providing as many opportunities as possible. Next slide, please.\nSpeaker 0: So these are the fees that we are proposing to increase this year. One is the youth athletic. The athletic fields for our youth user groups. We've been increasing this $1 per year every year for the last several years, and that's based on regular discussions with the user groups there.\nSpeaker 0: They're aware of this increase every year. And what we did is, is the fees used to be a set $500 a season and it was not a sustainable model. And so we switched to this hourly rate and with the goal to eventually get to ten or $11 per hour.\nSpeaker 0: And we recognized that we didn't want to do a big jump all at once. So we're doing it incrementally. And by doing this, by increasing these fees, it will help us better recover field maintenance costs such as fertilizer and field equipment, maintenance, water, utilities, the gym increase that you see before you for only made a point.\nSpeaker 0: Jim was based on an annual fee increase schedule that was adopted by council in 2019. So we continued with that set schedule to incrementally increase that over the next three years. Our group swim lessons, some actually went down.\nSpeaker 0: What we did is we used to have some lessons that were 45 minutes, some that were 30 minutes, and we actually decided to adjust all of the lessons to 30, 30 minutes. So the ones that were longer obviously came down in cost those group fees and there was also a slight increase for private fees.\nSpeaker 0: However, even with the increase in private fees, we've been increasing those over the last few years. The proposed fee is still significantly less than the cost of our our local folks of Aquatic and Harbor Bay Club. And we have a deep waiting list for those our youth programs, we're proposing an increase of 2%.\nSpeaker 0: Our standard is 5% each year as what we've been doing for several years. But this year, again, we minimized it to 2% due to the economic hardships faced by many of our families due to COVID 19. So just to put it in kind of number terms, this is the equivalent 4 to $1 per week for $62 per\nSpeaker 0: week program for after school program. Next slide, please. Great. So in terms of new fees, a few of these sort, so the cleanup fee you see before you is only if a large mess is made. It's really not that frequent, but it does happen sometimes.\nSpeaker 0: So we're really implementing this fee only as a deterrent. We're hoping not to use it and just would cover our staff costs to clean up after user groups who don't clean up after themselves. So we'll let them know and use it to encourage them to do it themselves.\nSpeaker 0: The veterans building didn't have specific fees and once were a post-COVID. We'd like to expand rental opportunities there. In regards to lifeguards, we are now requiring lifeguards for all swim facility rentals, including the user groups of swim and water polo teams, master's teams.\nSpeaker 0: This is not something that was previously required but really is best practice and also reduces the city's liability. And we have discussed this with the youth, with the user groups. They've expressed that they're fine with it and they recognize that it's not realistic for their coaches to be adequately supervising folks in the water for safety, as lifeguards\nSpeaker 0: do. You know, they're focused on one or two youth and their swimming techniques, and they're not looking at everything that's going on at the pool. Regarding adult sports tournaments, this is something we didn't have a fee for, but as a new program, we'd like to again, post-COVID, start offering things such as adult softball, dodgeball, things like that\nSpeaker 0: . The youth per hour cost is something that it doesn't supplant or other youth fees. It really is.\nSpeaker 3: I think we need to advance the slides that way.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 3: And I was doing it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Our youth per our course is something that simply provides us with more flexibility, such as what we needed during COVID. We need to react quickly or when we need to or want to start trial. A New Program.\nSpeaker 0: This provides us an opportunity to start a smaller program or make an adjustment as needed. It's still any standard program, such as after school program or camps will still follow the fees shown in the user fee schedule. So with that concludes my report, and I'm happy to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I didn't ask, do we have any public speakers on this item?\nSpeaker 5: We do not.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Counsel, any. The floor is open. Comments, questions, motion. And I just want to thank Ms. Wooldridge for all the incredible work you do day in and day out, but also during this pandemic, how you and your staff have just pivoted so wonderfully to continue serving our our community.\nSpeaker 3: You did a great job on Halloween, making it fun and festive and coming up with really creative alternatives. So I thank you for that. And I know you have some some plans up your sleeve for the winter holidays coming up.\nSpeaker 3: But thank you for for doing that, because, you know, recreation is just so important, especially now when we're all sheltering in place and the news doesn't seem to be getting any better right now. But we we have opened all of our parks and playgrounds, basketball courts.\nSpeaker 3: We just still ask you to do things you know, you're supposed to be doing. Wear your mask, social distance, wash your hands frequently. But council questions, comments, motion by some are not quite.\nSpeaker 4: So I will concur. I appreciate all the thought that has gone into this for me. I would like to recommend and I just noticed that the city manager's alternative recommendation. I would like to recommend that we consider adopting all the new proposed fees, but that we actually freeze the fees for the rest of our offerings for 2021\nSpeaker 4: . Given that, you know, first off, I'm just hard pressed to believe that we're going to have a lot of use at any of these facilities in 2021. And then I know that our nonprofits are being hit pretty hard and they're going to be struggling financially.\nSpeaker 4: And again, as I've said in other conversations, I think that the city is one of the few places that actually has the money that we can spend to provide services. And while I know it's going to be a little bit of a hit, I think we should acknowledge that our parents and nonprofits are taking a pretty huge\nSpeaker 4: one in a lot of ways, and that I would like to just recommend that we do that. So I will hold off making that as a motion because I know other people may have thoughts, but I'm ready to make that motion, if anybody interested.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Rosemary. Next week, Councilor Odie.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Madam Mayor. I think structure will bridge. I think there's a lot of thought that went into these, especially given the pandemic. But I concur with the vice mayor suggestion that we adopt new categories and regulations, but defer the actual increases until 2022, basically for the same reasons.\nSpeaker 1: Our nonprofits are going to be hard pressed to have to pay for anything, you know, let alone, you know. I'm not even sure when we're going to have an opportunity to have, you know, for example, you know, basketball games and such like that given given the trajectory directory of the pandemic and the fact that it's basically being\nSpeaker 1: ignored until at least January 20th.\nSpeaker 3: Bank accounts everybody else everyday so you're in muted is that because you want to comment.\nSpeaker 1: Sure. My quick comment is, let's see, the fee increases that are contemplated are basically meant to recover costs stemming from a use by certain groups or activities. So the costs someone will still clean up. If for whatever reason you know there is a mess, someone will still have to clean up that mess and someone will still have\nSpeaker 1: to provide swimming lessons if there are to be swimming lessons. If there are swimming lessons. So there's a service rendered and there's a cost associated with the service rendered. So it seems to me the costs that fee increases that are are part director has suggested.\nSpeaker 1: So I think they seem to be reasonable in light of the the potential. The potential demand for a Forest Service. It doesn't seem to be out of line. That's. That's my take.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Villa.\nSpeaker 0: So, you know, when I spoke with the city manager about this item prior to the meeting, one of the questions I had was how many people are actually using these facilities or making these rentals? How many of them are actually available right now?\nSpeaker 0: And the reason I asked that was because I think in many respects, people aren't necessarily having the same. There isn't the same demand for these things. Certainly, I think on our on our outdoor camps and things like that, we've had to make some significant changes and modifications to that.\nSpeaker 0: That said, I know that many families are struggling right now. And every dollar makes a difference. The other thing that I want to put out there for my colleagues is that a lot of our sports programs and teams and leagues, the way that they cover their costs is through tournaments.\nSpeaker 0: And I would hate to create a situation where we're actually encouraging people to go out and and violate essentially violate county orders in order to try to make money right now to stay afloat, to keep up with increasing costs.\nSpeaker 0: And I think, you know, I've reached out to some of the leagues and I just wanted to get a sense of kind of what were they doing and what are they, you know, what are their finances looking like?\nSpeaker 0: And I know, for instance, that that alone needs a little league. And then some of these groups, some of our largest nonprofits in town are, in fact, our sports sporting organizations. And and they're taking a huge hit and huge losses this year because they couldn't run their tournaments and and, you know, they reimbursed money and stuff like\nSpeaker 0: that. So I would agree with adopting, but it's kind of freezing and basically putting off the increases. I think that there's a lot of uncertainty right now, and I think it's the responsible thing to do. I understand that the costs will go up, but I also question how many of these things are are really going to make\nSpeaker 0: a difference in the event that we have people who are you know, we have these these pauses happening. And the bigger focus, the greater focus is on the pandemic and making sure that we have an adequate response. So I'm with that.\nSpeaker 0: I actually, you know, with I'd like to hear from the mayor and you know, but I'm leaning towards the alternative recommendation.\nSpeaker 3: So thank you, Councilmember Villa. I am just wondering and if you can help us out, Mr. Baldridge, on the page six and your alternatives. It does note that if the air user fee schedule is not approved, it will negatively impact the recreation fund.\nSpeaker 3: So what what are the implications of the recreation fund not having as much revenue as anticipated?\nSpeaker 0: Can you. Sure. Sure. Thank you, Mark. The impact would be coming back in mid-year or the next budget cycle for a potentially greater increasing the general fund transfer and require more funds from the general fund to offset because our expenditures don't change a whole lot.\nSpeaker 0: We still are maintaining the fields too, so they don't get overgrown, you know, things like that. Our rental facilities are closed. That's the primary thing that's closed currently. And it's it's a it's a big revenue generator for us.\nSpeaker 0: It's in that top end of the triangle. And even with our youth programs, we have a much because of COVID, a higher sorry, lower staff to child ratio. So we have higher costs to revenue ratio we normally would.\nSpeaker 0: So that's a long answer to that. I also want to add one thing in regards. I understand the concerns. I'm fine with that. I would like to look at the swim center, swim lesson cost, because we would like to shift everything to a half hour, 30 minute lesson.\nSpeaker 0: So some of them are actually going it's they're actually going down. So I'd like counsel two to consider this one lesson adjustment.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Okay. And what about the fact that you now are going to need to hire more lifeguards because of this change in policy? Do you have the funding to do that or will we?\nSpeaker 0: In terms of funding, there, there. We only put them out there when we have the revenue. The lifeguards are out there when we have the swim lessons happening or when we have the user groups out there. So the lifeguard fee is a new fee.\nSpeaker 0: So as I understand this, this this motion as it's developing, is it that would be covered under the new fee?\nSpeaker 3: It doesn't it won't impact new fees. Okay. Okay. Can we just go back to the slides? Is there a way we can or. I would like to just look and see a comparison of the new fees and the existing fees.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. We are bringing that up. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So these are all existing. Well, except the swim lessons there are wet and tractable, which is saying she'd like the council to consider because they are making an adjustment now that all lessons will be 30 minutes. So.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, got that. Okay, so here's the new fees. Okay. Um, and I forgot, is there when we're paging this. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Okay. So then based here, that's what I think you. We're starting to make a motion.\nSpeaker 3: Were you or.\nSpeaker 4: Durbin? I would like to move to call now an amended city manager's alternative proposal that we hold all the 2020 fees through 2021, with the exception of the the proposed reduction in swim fees that are reduced and accept the proposed new fees as as proposed with great appreciation to staff and an understanding of this art.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And a very valid. Did you want to speak to that or is that you, Conservative Councilor Brody blow.\nSpeaker 1: I can.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. We have a motion. It's been seconded will be further discussion seeing. Then we had a motion made by Vice Swett, seconded by Councilmember o.T.

There is a minor little matter. As to whether a. The proposed zoning is a good idea. And B, whether. The project, which it is intended.\nSpeaker 8: To permit. In fact. Meets the specifications of the zoning. I have not check that out, but someone else did raise that question and there may be some question as to whether all of the conditions of that zoning have, in fact, been met by the details of this project.\nSpeaker 8: This particular zoning, perhaps in the abstract, need not be a bad idea, but the way you see it realized in the project. Is not a very good idea. You could have the same density and more without destroying the usability, the usable green space that this design does.\nSpeaker 8: Because really, although it looks impressive from a top down view, it looks like you see plenty of green space between the buildings, that that space is pretty well wasted and useless because the buildings are high enough to pretty well shade and dominate the green space that's in that project.\nSpeaker 8: So I'm not saying that the density that you're going for is a bad thing. But doing it in this way doesn't work, and any zoning that just permits this without further control is not a good idea. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Thank you, sir.

This is some of the exciting parts of the transportation work this relates to if you're familiar with where Adobe in. Google are adjacent to the Fremont Bridge on the north side of the bridge and where the Burkman Trail Press is under the Fremont Bridge.\nSpeaker 4: It's a parcel underneath the bridge approach there. As I mentioned earlier, this this same work came before the council a few years back. For some variety of reasons. The council approved it at the time, but the legislation was never or what we authorized never actually was filed in the appropriate way before it expired.\nSpeaker 4: I believe it had to do with an attorney that was working for Fremont Company that retired, and it got buried in a piece of paper, in a stack of paper that no one else picked up. What specifically is happening is the city owns the right of way under the approach there.\nSpeaker 4: If you go on the Berkman, you'll see that there's actually parking down there, which is operated by Fremont Bridge Company through my company. Fremont DOT Company owns properties adjacent to that and the city requires easement to get to its property.\nSpeaker 4: So there was a trade that was made where Fremont, our company, would allow the city to have access to our property through their property in exchange for Fremont, our company being allowed to operate the parking underneath that. As I mentioned, this was agreed to a number of years ago, but it was never finalized.\nSpeaker 4: And so this will take this up once again and hopefully will get finalized appropriately.\nSpeaker 0: Very good.

        "source": "Speaker 1: Considered directing staff to provide the city council with a report on the feasibility of including Alameda in the service area or the Bay Area Bike Share Program. This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco\nSpeaker 5: , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know\nSpeaker 5: that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off.\nSpeaker 5: Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later.\nSpeaker 5: So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it.\nSpeaker 4: I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city.\nSpeaker 4: We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders.\nSpeaker 4: But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too.\nSpeaker 3: So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de SAC.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several.\nSpeaker 6: Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.\nSpeaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right. We're going to move on then.\nSpeaker 6: I mean.\nSpeaker 0: You had direction with that.\nSpeaker 4: There's consensus.\n",

About art, specifically in our city. And and even more specifically around the Denver Public Library's Central Branch and the Denver Museum. As as many of us know, we we care about the art here in the city of Denver.\nSpeaker 1: And I feel very excited and honored to have been to participated in this art selection process. It was it was as a result of pulling funds from both of those construction projects, from the Denver Museum and the Denver Public Library's Central Central Renovation.\nSpeaker 1: And and thanks to those to those two development processes, we have 700 more than $725,000 to dedicate to art that will be installed in three different locations. The artist Paul Castillo will will install the art in three different locations all around those two big renovations.\nSpeaker 1: So nearly three quarters of $1,000,000 just for art. That's that's pretty amazing. But what's even more amazing is our commitment to arts here in the in the city of Denver and and the Denver metro area. But we have a national model for art.\nSpeaker 1: 1% of all large developments are reserved for art installation. We also have the science, scientific and Cultural Facilities District. That's a seven county tax district that provides funding for art and culture in the Denver metro area. As far as I understand, this is unparalleled.\nSpeaker 1: There is nothing like this anywhere else in the nation. And we get a lot of, you know, people who visit our city from other other cities. We are ambassadors on your behalf to other cities in the nation. And when I talk about the AfCFTA, we almost universally get jealous comments on behalf of the this kind of funding\nSpeaker 1: . So and then finally, we also have a community that is heavily engaged in the arts and who give generously of their time and treasure. So so this is how we could have the CFD. This is how we could dedicate 1% of funding development of development projects to the arts.\nSpeaker 1: And even then on top of that, we have and we have our community that that gives. So much to art here in our city and our metro area. I want to thank arts and venues for you, for your work, and including Michael Childers and Director Brunetti.\nSpeaker 1: And that's all I have.

And members of the City Council. City Council's approval is being requested to amend the Fy22 master fees and charges schedule. This is something that's updated citywide at least twice a year to allow departments to meet City Council's stated policy on user fees, which calls for full.\nSpeaker 2: Cost recovery whenever appropriate.\nSpeaker 8: City Council last approved an amended master fees and charges schedule on September 7th as part of the Fy22 budget adoption.

He's not in the audience.\nSpeaker 0: I don't see public comment. We to go and go back to the dais. Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 7: I just want to take a moment to recognize the staff at financial management. It has taken a long time for us to get to a place where we know and understand our fees in a meaningful way. I know it took many years.\nSpeaker 7: I do want to ask specifics on an animal control licensing fee for about four years now. We've been asking that all of the licenses get coordinated through a process where you would be able to pay a partial year to catch up so that all your animals can be renewed at once, saving the department hundreds of dollars a\nSpeaker 7: year, if not definitely be thousands by now considering postage rates. Instead of mailing my house three animal dog license renewals at three different months of the year. You'd save a dollar by putting them all together. This has been three years in the making and I've heard excuses of, Well, we don't have a fee that works for that\nSpeaker 7: or we can't prorate. Do we have any progress towards that? Do we need to add a fee to the schedule or do we need to make any annotation at this time that we'd like to be able to prorate and ensure that entering into the fiscal year of 2020.\nSpeaker 7: Three. No. Yes. 2023. That that would be policy.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. We have our director.\nSpeaker 2: Of Parks, Recreation and Marine.\nSpeaker 8: Who can come up and talk on that. Parks, Recreation and Marine was part of the round one fee study for our citywide fee study. So that may have also been something that was looked at during that.\nSpeaker 7: And I apologize. I know that this started before our current Parks and Rec director. We appreciate you. And we know you picked up a lot of projects and this is a big priority and I'll make sure it's done before the next fiscal year.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I know Stacy Danes, who unfortunately is ill tonight, or she'd be able to probably answer this more specifically. But I know in our recent council briefing last month, we did discuss this in depth.\nSpeaker 1: And I know she is looking into that alignment, which makes a lot of sense. So we are working towards that. And I appreciate your bringing attention to this financial matter.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Mr. Monaco, do I have your assurances that this is something we can pursue before the next budget cycle? Or do I need to bring an agenda item?\nSpeaker 1: Sure, we'll work on it. I'll get this as an item you and I've talked about, and we're talking with the Parks and Rec director about what's the path forward and if you'll need to bring an item. If there's some other challenge that we need to tell you about, we will do that.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I appreciate it. I know it's a priority for animal lovers across the city and an opportunity for us to really find some cost savings and save the money for the department.

Just that we hear this item, because I want to make sure that we're moving all the items up that we have request for item 28, which is the utility\nSpeaker 0: wires audit.\nSpeaker 3: No. Item 28 Communication from Councilwoman Price. Councilmember Super Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request City Manager to report back in 60 days on the feasibility of directing public works to conduct an audit of utility wires throughout the city to identify maintenance needs and violations.\nSpeaker 8: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I am encouraging my colleagues to support this item tonight. Throughout the city of Long Beach, you can see large collections of utility wires crisscrossing streets, alleys and over residences. Often these wires are wrapped in bundles, hanging from telephone poles or tied to other wires.\nSpeaker 8: Sometimes these wires are tangled among tree branches or appear in disrepair and have been left and removed when a previous business or residential tenant has moved out. Violations of maintenance standards by the utility provider can cause safety concerns, including increased risk of fire, high wind, disconnecting, poorly maintained wires, tree branches causing service interruptions and downed power lines\nSpeaker 8: , resulting in damage to private property. Additionally, utility wires that are not well-maintained create visual blight throughout our city and can contribute to the overall deterioration of a community. Individual resident groups have begun conducting their own evaluations of wire issues like these and have begun documenting these maintenance and safety concerns with only volunteer time and expertize.\nSpeaker 8: This effort is severely limited and I want to acknowledge the Belmont Heights Community Association for taking a leadership role in bringing this issue to light. This issue could be addressed more comprehensively if city departments were to conduct an audit of major and minor corridors, alleys and other areas to assess the locations of maintenance issues and safety concerns\nSpeaker 8: with the goal of providing this information to the utility providers, as well as the California Public Utilities Commission. Most recently, we've seen fire danger that has spread throughout Southern California. And if we have ways to identify fire risks, such as abandoned wires in areas that can cause fires, we should be addressing those and addressing them as a\nSpeaker 8: public safety and public health issue. Long Beach is a beautiful and amazing city, but there's always room for improvement and taking more action to maintain something we all see every day, like utility wires, is something we can do to improve everyone's safety as well as make residents feel better about their community.\nSpeaker 8: Sure there is. This is not the biggest issue facing Long Beach today. That's definitely clear. But this is another way that we can continue to work to make sure Long Beach residents feel proud of their neighborhood and that we minimize the risk of fire danger in our communities.\nSpeaker 8: So with that, I'd ask my colleagues to support this item, and I know we do have some public comment on this item tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I want to go to a public comment or councilman, you want to go first?\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'll just say I second the motion. I think this is a very responsible item coming forward. And I want to thank Councilmember Price for bringing it forward and asking me to sign on as a coauthor. I think this is the only concern I have is whether or not 60 days is long enough for for this order\nSpeaker 6: to actually happen and what sort of proactive efforts will staff make once they find hazards out there so that. My comments, but I'll be happy to support this.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Let me go and do public comment then.\nSpeaker 2: Hello.\nSpeaker 9: My name is Sydney Simon. I live at 4115 East Second Street and I am wholeheartedly in support of this agenda item. Um, I have been interested in this issue for a long time and 202,013 I wrote an article for the Belmont Heights Community Association newsletter about the egregious wires going all over my driveway, patio, backyard, everywhere, and\nSpeaker 9: people just came out of the woodwork on this issue and everybody was interested in working on it. So we developed a team to go out and survey our our neighborhood using the criteria of if there were. We called out locations of lines that were more than two lines going to one house, low drooping lines, and the big\nSpeaker 9: rat's nest of wires that's at the at the poles. We filed a complaint with the CPSC, sending in our survey pictures, supporting letters signed by nine other community associations. And we were told that we had no standing unless it was on our property.\nSpeaker 9: We couldn't contact the service CPSC. So I just kept going up on their organizational chart until I finally found a fill in as Mr. Fill In, it says, was a program director of consumer affairs for CPSC, and he sent out their chief engineer to meet with us to go over the survey and to meet with Verizon and\nSpeaker 9: Charter. He called out many infractions that the charter companies had done and the CPSC sent a notice to Verizon to fix them and they basically refused. So the engineer said that he would send it to their legal department.\nSpeaker 9: Well, they heard nothing back. So a year later, we wrote a letter to the city attorney asking for help if he could contact. And it was eventually turned over to. Two, Art Sanchez, who is deputy city attorney, taking care of those issues.\nSpeaker 9: And he sent an email to the CPSC general counsel asking to be enlightened on what has happened. And we got no answer at all at that point. We had a meeting with Diana Tang and Art Sanchez, and at Councilwoman Price's suggestion, it was turned over to the legislative state committee here.\nSpeaker 9: And we have heard nothing more about that. So so anyway, I want to say, I don't 100% support having a survey for the whole city. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much next week for please.\nSpeaker 9: Good evening. My name is Diane Sundstrom. My address is on file. I also live in Belmont Heights. I'm a board member of the community association and I'm Sidney sidekick.\nSpeaker 8: In this effort.\nSpeaker 9: And I also want to encourage the council to support this motion. I think it's very important. And to add on to Sidney's comments, when Verizon refused to comply with the CPU Seas directive to correct safety violations, we decided to go to the PUC.\nSpeaker 8: Hearing in August of.\nSpeaker 9: 2015 that related to the Verizon Frontier transfer. And I spoke about Verizon's refusal to comply. And as one would expect, there was a flurry of activity after that meeting, but that was not sustained. So we continued, as Sidney said, speaking to the city, Diana Tang was very involved.\nSpeaker 9: Councilwoman Pryce And eventually we also talked to Congressman O'Donnell's office and met with Senator Laura. And our meeting with Senator Laura.\nSpeaker 8: Ended up in another meeting with the.\nSpeaker 9: CP you see in our community this year. And as a result of that, again, representatives from all the offices I just mentioned came as well as, again, Raffi Stepanian, who's the.\nSpeaker 8: C's chief engineer.\nSpeaker 9: And also Elizaveta Malashenko, who's the director of safety and.\nSpeaker 8: Enforcement.\nSpeaker 9: At the CP. You see, and it was very clear from that meeting that wire safety.\nSpeaker 8: In other words.\nSpeaker 9: Wires that are not compliant as well as wire blight is still a very big issue.\nSpeaker 8: In the city.\nSpeaker 9: Rafi stood at the corner of a street between between Roswell and Examiner.\nSpeaker 8: On third and in his line of vision. And I quote him There are many safety violations.\nSpeaker 9: So Elizaveta, after.\nSpeaker 8: That meeting, sent us an email copying Diana Tang and others.\nSpeaker 9: And said that there are a couple of proceedings that would be of interest and that would likely result in some action. And one of those is a combined poor management proceeding.\nSpeaker 8: In other words, creating a.\nSpeaker 9: Shared database or a statewide census, which might be beyond our ability at this point of utility poles and conduits.\nSpeaker 8: And conduits, meaning.\nSpeaker 9: Wires. So again, it's become very.\nSpeaker 8: Apparent.\nSpeaker 9: In discussions with the CP, you see that safety as well as wire blight are a major problem. It's also clear that as a small community organization, we have no clout or nor influence. So we fully support and encourage passing Councilwoman.\nSpeaker 8: Price's.\nSpeaker 9: Motion. It's a recommended course of action from the CP you see and does have the potential to effect change.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you very.\nSpeaker 3: Much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. And our last speaker on this topic and then we'll go back to the council.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Dave Shukla on file. I'd like to thank my councilwoman and Mrs. Price.\nSpeaker 5: As well as Councilman Austin for bringing this forward.\nSpeaker 0: It's a tremendously important move for safety, to assess.\nSpeaker 5: The fire risk as well as possible explosion risk from the electrical transmission conduits, the infrastructure that we have, the transmission lines. I'd like to make just a couple of quick suggestions to improve this process, because I think it's very important and I hope you all support it.\nSpeaker 5: The first is pulling together the volunteer efforts of the HCA and others into a database, as suggested, even if it's just for the city. This info that that data shouldn't just be shared with the investor owned utilities and the CPU only, but it should definitely be shared with the three companies that we're contracting with to perform a\nSpeaker 5: feasibility study for a community choice aggregation program. And it should also be shared with the neighborhood associations and residents who live with these fire risks and potential for explosions from the undergrounding, as we've seen in more than one place in the city, certainly downtown over the.\nSpeaker 0: Past couple of years.\nSpeaker 5: And it should be expanded to include the type of.\nSpeaker 4: Alliance.\nSpeaker 5: Electric as well. We've heard a lot about telecom. Electric, you know, long distance transmission lines from generation telecom, the conditional use permit for putting telecom infrastructure, cable, DSL, cell phones, whatever it is on existing electrical infrastructure. And also looking at potentially the undergrounding.\nSpeaker 5: And if a city wide map or citywide database of all of this risk can be achieved, we should take the time to do it right. If that means take. 120 days. 220 days. This may be the first and best opportunity you have to completely understand before we have a precipitous development.\nSpeaker 0: What our full set of risks are, I think. Thank you. Without. Go back to the council. Councilman Pierce.\nSpeaker 9: I just want to thank my colleagues for this. I know this is a big issue in my district. We've had several neighborhood associations from Rose Park to Alamo Speech that have called on these issues and however much time it takes of it, 60 days or 120 days.\nSpeaker 9: We fully support this and want to thank everyone for bringing this forward.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 8: Yes, thank you, Councilmember Price, for bringing this forward. And we do have this on the state legislative agenda. I know Councilmember Austin chairs that. And there's under local control and our priorities, we have them both to support policies that will ensure that blight is eliminated relative to utility wires.\nSpeaker 8: Aside from that, I have a question that's probably not within this ordinance, but it just came up in a downtown community meeting. And it was the the it's more of a private issue, but I don't know if we have an answer for it now, but it's the cable or satellite dishes that are that exist on these buildings\nSpeaker 8: . And we have a multitude of them in downtown that could also pose a major risk. And I don't know if there's any sort of. Incentive or something that we can do to to get these removed, because a lot of the downtown residents, they move into these places that already have satellite dishes.\nSpeaker 8: And not only is it blight, but it could pose another issue. I don't know if we have an answer for that right now. If not, I can maybe just do another item.\nSpeaker 11: While we're doing this, we can also research the possibility of looking at the dish satellites that may have been abandoned and are still there and stuff. But there's certainly a lot that have been abandoned and we'll take a look at those.\nSpeaker 8: To create may add a friendly amendment to do that. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. There is a motion and a second on the item. A roll call vote, please.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman Gonzales. Councilmember Pierce. Councilwoman Price. Councilmember Superman II. Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 9: I.\nSpeaker 3: Vice Mayor Andrews. Councilmember Miranda.\nSpeaker 1: Art.\nSpeaker 3: Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson.\n",

Any agreement with sound transit to implement light rail extension between Ballard and West Seattle is approved by regional voters under Sound Transit three.\nSpeaker 3: The committee recommends a resolution be adopted.\nSpeaker 8: Councilmember O'Brien So this resolution is another agreement between the city and sound transit. This relates specifically to what was approved in Sound Transit three, specifically the extension of light rail to the communities of Ballard and West Seattle and the neighborhoods it will pass through.\nSpeaker 8: This is kind of a landmark legislation in that we're working well in advance of construction documents to get the city in the in sound transit agency into alignment. As you may recall and understand, Transit three, there was a lot of excitement about light rail and everyone wanted to see light rail come quicker to their neighborhoods.\nSpeaker 8: And so part of the attempt to streamline the process and move more swiftly in what is certainly a long time frame because this is a complex project, is making sure that the city and the agency are aligned in how we proceed with things like permitting and planning.\nSpeaker 8: I believe on this one, Councilmember Herbold has an amendment to add a little bit of language of rehearsal.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. I do have an amendment and it is an amendment to section 2.41 in attachment A of the park partnering agreement. I think what I'll do is I'll move it weight for a second and then explain what it does.\nSpeaker 5: That's okay.\nSpeaker 8: I'll second.\nSpeaker 9: All right.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. And so basically what this portion of the partnership agreement relates to instances in which there might be a conflict between the sound transit project or an existing or proposed City of Seattle Transportation project. And as it as it reads currently, it talks about wanting to resolve conflicts as early and as possible in order to reduce\nSpeaker 5: risk to the sound transit project development and delivery. And because I have one such project in my district where there is a conflict between what might be a future sound transit alignment and a long planned project that SDR is carrying out.\nSpeaker 5: It got me thinking about sort of in real life, what we should be seeking to do in trying to reduce risks, and that we should not just be seeking to reduce risks in the sound transit project, but that we need to make sure that part of our lens is to reduce risk in the city projects as well\nSpeaker 5: . And so this language allows us to to sort of reminds us to think about that as well when we are working to reduce those conflicts.\nSpeaker 1: Very good. The amendment has been moved. And second, Councilmember Johnson, as.\nSpeaker 7: Your designee to the Zone Transit Board, I had a check in with sound transit staff and they are perfectly okay with this amendment.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Glad to hear any other questions. Um. Let's see. Well, we'll just vote on the amendment first. So all those in favor of the amendment, please vote I. I oppose. The ayes have it.

        "source": "Speaker 3: Okay. Great. Thank you. Much information carries you counsel. We do have a couple of items are still a part of this broader discussion. And thank you all for that conversation on the on the general framework. So now we're going to take up item 26.\nSpeaker 0: Communication from Councilman Austin, Councilwoman Price, Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Richardson recommendation to request city manager to report back within 30 days on the Citizens Police Complaint Commission.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Let me turn this over to Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 4: I thank you, Mayor, and I want to thank my colleagues who signed on to this item. And before I start, I want to just preface that I got my start in public service here in the city of Long Beach with the city of Long Beach as a commissioner on a Citizen Police Complaint Commission.\nSpeaker 4: I was appointed in 2003 by then Mayor Beverly O'Neill. I was very deliberate about getting on that commission because at the time I was a lot younger and I saw things and many of the issues that we're talking about today were prevalent then it was and I worked on staff were state senator who.\nSpeaker 4: Had authored the original racial profiling bill. Driving while Black Bill. And so this was it was intentional for me to get on that commission. I worked to get on it. I talked to my city council member. I talked to the mayor.\nSpeaker 4: I realized that there was nobody who looked like me, who was in my demographic at that time, being of young black male. You served on that commission. And so it was it's been this is this was a hard work for me.\nSpeaker 4: And so just a little bit of a background. The Citizen Police Complaints Commission was established by the voters in Long Beach in 1990. It came following another high profile incident of police violence against a black man in this case.\nSpeaker 4: His name was Don Jackson, and ironically, he was an off duty police officer here in Long Beach, not with a lot of his police department, but in 1989, he had been beaten and thrown through a plate glass window by one of these police officers in an incident that was captured on video.\nSpeaker 4: At the time, the CPC. CPC was a pioneering effort that was approved by the voters, where anybody, any person has a right to make a complaint against any employee of the London Police Department, whether it be an allegation of police misconduct with emphasis on excessive force or false arrest complaints with racial or sexual overtones.\nSpeaker 4: These complaints are investigated and the CPC PCC was charged to make findings resulting in the recommendations that accused personnel be disciplined, trained or exonerated. Here we are 30 years later. Time for us to look ways at the CPC can be updated and improve accountability, transparency and confidence in the relationship between the community and our police department.\nSpeaker 4: It is important that we have a timely conversation now on how to improve the efficacy of the PCC. I would like to thank the IPCC commissioners, many who have served the city over the last 30 years. As a former commissioner myself, I know how much work that goes into reviewing these cases, how many late nights people put\nSpeaker 4: into it studying these cases. And and and I will tell you, as council members, you know, their agendas oftentimes resemble ours in terms of the volume of reading that goes into these cases that come before the P.C.C. Their meeting packets are thick.\nSpeaker 4: And like I said, it's not thicker than many of our our council agenda packets. I've also had the opportunity to speak with several former and current commissioners over the past few days to get their feedback on this item.\nSpeaker 4: I'd like to thank the London Police Department also for their cooperation and collaboration. Understanding that the PCC is an independent entity in the Charter Commission and it is governed by the people. It's been mentioned earlier. If there are any changes to come to this commission, it would require well.\nSpeaker 4: Any any functional changes would require a vote of the people. But I believe that there are also opportunities for us to work with the city manager's office because the PCC is under the office of the City Manager. I believe there's an opportunity for us to make some administrative changes as well and make some immediate short term improvements\nSpeaker 4: that can improve efficacy, that improve the operations of the Commission, that could add value to all the work that they do. For example, there are staffing concerns with the independent investigators who handle case loads. I'm told that there are two part time investigators that handle case loads.\nSpeaker 4: I'm told that we have temporary administrative staff who will prepare the cases and deal with the database, work for that commission. The question arises, should there be more training for the commissioners? Should there be more community? Engagement in in the Commission.\nSpeaker 4: When I was chair of the Commission 2004 to 2005, I instituted a community training which brought in people to the police academy, residents to the police academy, along with the commissioners, to learn more about police practices and training so that when they were reading these cases, we were reading these cases, we would have a greater understanding about\nSpeaker 4: what is in the mindset of an officer. Right. How are they trained? Can we make recommendations on on on on on on on on training? Obviously, as citizens, we're not police officers. We don't have the same level of training.\nSpeaker 4: But we should, when looking and reviewing their cases, have an understanding of their work. So I thought that that was very good. And at the time to try to foster greater community relations, I brought in the organizations that were oftentimes at odds or questions, a lot of these police tactics.\nSpeaker 4: And at that time, in 2005, we brought in the Fruit of Islam, the captains from the Fruit of Islam to participate in that. And there was. There was was a great understanding and relationship building during that period of time.\nSpeaker 4: There should also be timely reports for the City Council, including the briefing of Office of the Office of the Council of Officer Involved Shootings. And I would say at this point, moving forward, any officer involved shooting can be a source of complaint from a they go through the PCC.\nSpeaker 4: But I would say that every officer involved shooting should come to the council for briefings and review. We are at that time. We need greater oversight and we can do a better job as a city council. We should always we should also look at allowing video testimony from complainants and witnesses rather than just written reports.\nSpeaker 4: The way the Citizen's Police Complaints Commission works is that these cases are investigated. As I mentioned, there are major packets where commissioners have to go through text and review statements from complainants, witnesses. But also offer some statements are not included in that because they're not compelled to give statements, statements.\nSpeaker 4: That's something that we probably should be looking at as well. I have questions. How, how, what access to the P.C.C. Now have to have you feel footage from body worn cameras. While CB, S.C. has subpoena authority. I mentioned they cannot compel statements from officers.\nSpeaker 4: That is something we might want to consider. The state legislation. I'd like to hear from my colleagues as well. The CPC, I believe, is an important tool for accountability and transparency when it comes to our community's confidence in our police department and and it holds officers accountable.\nSpeaker 4: I look forward to a review of reforms that we can make, make the PCC more effective. And I'd like to just also say that, you know, I've heard from a number of commissioners. They are submitting recommendations on a format, like I said, existing in former commissioners.\nSpeaker 4: They are submitting recommendations for or or potential reform. And this is just a start to the conversation. I want to be very clear on that. I'm laying this out there. I've asked the city manager to review this and come back in 30 days.\nSpeaker 4: But I'm also open to allowing this and layering this with the previous agenda item as part of the community conversation. That needs to happen as well as the city manager needs more than 30 days, or if we can make that happen with that within that 30 day window.\nSpeaker 4: That would be great. But I'm going to be also forwarding the city manager recommendations from other commissioners that that I have received an email and also phone calls. And again, I think we're up to about two dozen recommendations on a potential reforms to that commission and how we can improve its its work.\nSpeaker 4: I don't want to. Devalue the importance of that commission when, as I mentioned before, you look at the National Organization for Civilian Oversight Commissions, you know, at least when I served on the commission, it was Long Beach was was one of the model commissions.\nSpeaker 4: Right. Civilian oversight has changed significantly over the last 30 years. And so because of that, I think it merits a review and potential reform of our commission. So with that, I would look forward to hearing from our colleagues and hearing your comments.\nSpeaker 4: Again, it's not a perfect system. It's our system. It's one that we've had for 30 years. When Ferguson broke out, we were this was one of the first solutions that they pointed to us as as is a need there.\nSpeaker 4: And that was just a few years ago, I would say, within the last 3 to 5 years. L.A. County, just the sheriffs just were. Just became subject to civilian oversight. So it's very, very important that we have this conversation.\nSpeaker 4: Again, I'm happy to bring this item forward. I think it's timely and in light of everything that is going on. And I look forward to my colleague's comments. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews, you're the second.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Thank you, ma'am. First of all, I've got a lot of people going forward. You know, as we look at this commission, we really need to use our equity lens now, only reporting bad press. And we have the conversations.\nSpeaker 4: I'm looking on the city's website and it says that basically learning opportunity. Long Beach resident speak of equity and have served our communities. Oh, that sounds great. We need to talk about the purpose of this. This commission has the ability to determine here and obviously get trained, but dismissed.\nSpeaker 4: This is not a commission one can serve on an entire. You have to take someone complaints and become aware of appropriate and that occurs. And it is a serious problem that needs to consider the side of the story and try to find the best possible timeline of the event and the Act before guidance recommendations.\nSpeaker 4: You can not continue to be a boss which when reviewing play. I cannot be just another commission. He place somewhere on this. Yes, James. That is. We have been completely honest. I have never heard it from a single commissioner or this commission.\nSpeaker 4: More than one I have ever had a brief briefing from them, like Father Thomas Maser. They swear to do so. This is not a reflection on the commission for this year. It is a reflection on the work that we all need to do to get away from my colleagues.\nSpeaker 4: And I am looking forward to the report coming back. Thank you again.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I want to thank Councilman Orson for bringing this forward. This is an example of a very clear and tangible item that we can start looking at and adopting best practices for. So I want to thank you for bringing that forward.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Austin, you have a lot more in-depth knowledge of the workings of this commission than I think at least certainly more than me. I can't speak for my other council colleagues, but you're very well versed in this. So I think it's it's going to be very helpful for us to have that insight.\nSpeaker 1: I will tell you that this is the one commission that I have received a lot of concern and recommendations or, let's say, opportunities for improvement on over the last six years. And there have been a lot of questions over the years asked.\nSpeaker 1: But I think just even understanding the framework for the Commission and what they're tasked with and what tools they have at their disposal would be a really helpful educational tool for the Council. In the six years that I've been on, we've never really had, you know, a staff reporter presentation on what they're supposed to do.\nSpeaker 1: So I think this is a great first step. And I want to thank you, Councilman Austin, for bringing this forward. And certainly this could be something that we could discuss even further if the opportunity arises at our public safety committee and a committee in a public or an a subcommittee type setting so that we can allow for\nSpeaker 1: more dialog. Since I know sometimes at council comments are limited to such a short period of time and there's not as much opportunity for a dialog, but that's another venue for you to think about since you know the workings of this commission.\nSpeaker 1: Better that better than I do. But if that's something you want to think about, but it's a great item. I wholeheartedly support it and I hope the rest of the council does as well. Thanks.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilmember. Awesome for bringing this forward. I know you and I have talked about this commission in the past and it's unfortunate that this moment took this moment to get movement on it. But I'm glad that that you've taken the leadership to get it here.\nSpeaker 2: I, too, have over the years had a lot of people talk about the effectiveness or the clarity, the transparency of this committee. And I also had the great opportunity to talk to Congressmember Lowenthal about this commission. And, you know, someone that brought this commission forward and him today saying that it needs a great overhaul is also a\nSpeaker 2: reflection of how far we've come as a state and as a city. I had a question for the city attorney as we talk about the last item with some of the civilian oversight process and then this commission. I have one commissioners, actually, two commissioners that have been very outspoken about feeling like if we even start on this\nSpeaker 2: commission, that it's going to be very difficult. And that making sure that we have a civilian oversight that's really separate of the city would be important. So my question is for the city attorney and to review this and put some changes in if we're able to do that.\nSpeaker 2: But what changes require the charter changes? Like what is the trigger for putting this on the ballot? And then my second question is, are there other ways to get civilian oversight quicker than, say, two years that really have teeth that are separate and independent from the city?\nSpeaker 2: That does not require charter? And if you could just share with the public those two things.\nSpeaker 6: Mayor, members of the council. I will try the basically the charter as described by Council member Austin, who did a great job describing the PCC, was established by the vote of the people in 1990 as a charter committee and so any changes to the powers and duties of that committee require a vote of the people to either\nSpeaker 6: repeal it or to amend it or to change it. So as we as I anticipated what this item would be, we would come back with a report that would describe the history of the PCC. And in the Charter it identifies the duties that the and the responsibilities of that commission.\nSpeaker 6: And then if there are proposed changes and it sounds like there are already a number of suggested modifications to that committee, those would all require a vote of the people to amend the PCC as it currently exists. If that answers your question.\nSpeaker 2: Then it is my first question. So my second question is how are there ways that the city can get an independent oversight police commission that is independent of the city without going to the vote of the people or without a charter change?\nSpeaker 6: They're there. Your. I we'd have to look at what what it is you'd want to establish. And if I understand your question correctly, an oversight body of the of the Long Beach Police Department. There could be a under the municipal code, you could establish an advisory committee to determine and to advise the city manager or the city\nSpeaker 6: council on proposed changes or policy decisions. That would be the council purview. The I think you do need a vote of the people to establish some sort of a charter amendment, because currently under the charter, the authority for the discipline lies with the police of the chief of police and ultimately with the city manager as your executive\nSpeaker 6: director of the of the city. So in order to take those. It sounds like you're suggesting that you would possibly want to remove those two and put them in place with a body. And that would require a charter amendment to to make that happen.\nSpeaker 6: It could be done, but it would need a charter amendment. If. If I understood your question correctly, again, it's going to be specific on what it is you would like to do, and we'd like an opportunity to research it and report back.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, I appreciate that. I was asking just because I know that we've all thrown out a lot of dates and a lot of great ideas and we're trying to figure out like, okay, so November, have we missed the deadline for charter amendment for November?\nSpeaker 6: That is correct. The under state law, there is a specific, very specific notice provision and period which requires three public notices with certain dates days in between those notices. And that time has passed for the November 2020 election.\nSpeaker 2: Right. So that was why I had the other question was just to be having you think about it and I know that we already have the other item, but just publicly talking about like what are ways that we can not only with PD, because I firmly believe that PD is a body of the city and that we\nSpeaker 2: need to have some oversight and structure around race and policing in general. So just thinking and letting the public kind of hear that there are other options that aren't charter reform, we need to be specific about that and we'll work with staff to get that back.\nSpeaker 2: But that right now we can't do charter reform on November's ballot.\nSpeaker 6: That is correct. And just for for clarification, you do have oversight and and review of the police department is currently with the chief and with the city manager. I think you didn't mean to say there is no oversight or review of that.\nSpeaker 6: That and the CPCB makes recommendations to the city manager pursuant to their authority under the charter also.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for that. And I would I would say that. As Councilmember often mentioned, we have not had a report, at least from one of the commission of reports that I had an email from in the last three years to the city council, at least not one that's been publicly discussed.\nSpeaker 2: And so, you know, looking at areas that we need to tighten up and make sure that we're abiding by the law that's in front of us in our own charter, and to is that we, the Council, have oversight over our city manager, but our city manager is the one that has oversight over everyone else.\nSpeaker 2: And I personally only meet with our commanders and I don't meet with our police chief on a regular basis. We've tried over the last four years, but I don't. And so it it it makes it difficult, you know.\nSpeaker 2: And so these are all the issues of transparency and access that are important for this committee for us to all be thinking about. The one last part I wanted to just publicly recognize is, you know, I also led the efforts with Councilmember Austin and others around our H.R. practices.\nSpeaker 2: And we know that there's a lot of great changes there that need to be made. What I'm hearing from our commissioners is also that they they don't feel like and they have not been presented with at least the chair that I've talked to.\nSpeaker 2: Policies and procedures for them as commissioners and for understanding what the policies and procedures are for the staff that's supposed to be working with them. And so basic things like that, I look forward to having a conversation with that.\nSpeaker 2: I don't think would require charter reform, but just basic, you know, keeping our house tidy. And so I hope to to hear from from staff and from city attorney on on some of those. And then my one last question.\nSpeaker 2: As you look to bring this back, are there ways for independent attorneys to be involved with the PCC as it exists right now?\nSpeaker 6: No. The under the charter, the city attorney's office is a sole and exclusive legal adviser to the city and its boards and commissions, and we advise the PCC.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Those are my questions. Think again. Trying to move forward to a fuller discussion when it's brought back. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Next up is Council Member Richardson.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to acknowledge. Acknowledge this effort. Thank you. Councilman Orson, I know you spent a lot of time on the KPCC. Probably more experience with it than anyone else on the council. You know?\nSpeaker 5: And I want to I want to say the framework we just voted on separately, we're very clear that, you know, everything needs to be on the table. So reform to see PCC, independent oversight, all of those needs to be evaluated.\nSpeaker 5: I think since KPCC is there and we know its charter, I think the questions about how it works now that that's low hanging fruit, they can start now. I think everybody points points to it that it can be know look at the issues with it, but it could arrive at, you know, the charter and they need to\nSpeaker 5: change it or the charter may need to like eliminate it in favor of a new process or a different type of process. And so that's what these conversations are. And I want to just encourage people, not the rest of the solution, to let it play out.\nSpeaker 5: Let's let's bring up the issues are understanding it and be open to what whatever form this might look like and know that. Those are my comments. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Ringo.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you all, councilmember, also for bringing this forward. It has been 30 years since this commission has been put in place and reviewed. Whether the things that came out of it was also that it is to be in conjunction with each other and with civil service.\nSpeaker 4: Most officers that are disciplined are classified employees, and there's a process. They go through civil service, through a hearing. The recommendation the PCC makes is to the city manager. In the city manager makes his decision as to where it goes from there and then it goes to Civil Service Commission if there's a disciplinary action.\nSpeaker 4: One of the things that came out of that, that the event that you're talking about comes from Ross in 1989 with Don Jackson was that those two officers, Ramsey and Mickey, called it the Marx Brothers. And they were Mark Ramsey and Mark.\nSpeaker 4: Mark Dickey. They they were disciplined. And but one of the things that really came out of it was, for me, shameful is that they were allowed to disability, retire. They were not dismissed or terminated, which means that as a disability, retired retiree, their pension, they receive their pension and they don't get taxed on it.\nSpeaker 4: So basically they were. They left because they said they were stressed. They created that stress by pushing Mr. Jackson's head through that plate glass window and and in the subsequent events he took after that. So we look at it.\nSpeaker 4: We also have to look at a charge role and the Civil Service Department's role or commissions role in this whole process as well. So if we're going to look at the PCC and its role in reviewing of cases of abuse or misuse of honor under the color of our uniform, we also have to look at those other\nSpeaker 4: entities that are involved with that as well. Would that require a charter change? I don't know, but it would certainly determine how the other two commission, the whole of the department and the Civil Service Commission relates to it.\nSpeaker 4: So we also have to look at and take that into consideration as well. And what's the what's the end game that we want with the PCC? We want to give it more teeth. Or do you want to just change how it functions as a whole?\nSpeaker 4: One of the things that that was that has come over the years to me my attention anyway. Is that the CPC has no teeth. It has recommendations, but it doesn't have any authority to deal with the word officers if that in fact is what comes out of the investigation, that that lies directly with the city manager.\nSpeaker 4: And and and the chief of police. So we we need also need to look at the role that it plays with the other hiring authorities, h.r. And the civil service commission, which basically is a body that that deals with classified employees when there's any kind of disciplinary action.\nSpeaker 4: Just throwing it out there that we need to include that review as well in terms of the role that they play with the CPC and the CPC interacts with those other two entities as well.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, councilmember councilmembers. And.\nSpeaker 1: I just want to echo the comments of my colleagues, and I think this is a really good step in the right direction. And thank you so much, council member Austin, for bringing this item forward. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilwoman, I think that has been I think the entire council have made comments. I'm going to come to conclude and close out this this item as we move on to some other ones. Well, let me just first begin just by thanking council member Austin especially for bringing this forward.\nSpeaker 3: I think it does tie in with the framework that was also adopted by the City Council and and like most of the council, I've also received a lot of it, a lot of ideas, suggestions from from commissioners and from community members as well.\nSpeaker 3: I want to just mention a couple of things. I think the first thing that's important is I want to uplift. I know there's been a lot of conversation about the commission. The commission was, of course, created by the vote of the people, the people of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 3: And it's clear that, you know, decades later, it's time to revisit that commission and and revisit how it works, how it functions, how it can be more community oriented and how we can improve it. I think that's important.\nSpeaker 3: Any time that this that the city and the voters create something, there's always opportunities to revisit it and to to make them stronger and to meet the moment that we are in. And so I support this initiative at looking at the PCC.\nSpeaker 3: I want to also thank those that serve. I think certainly it's easy to for us to acknowledge or for folks to criticize and maybe the commission might work or the way it's set up. The way it works is laid out in the charter.\nSpeaker 3: And so we certainly can change the charter or we can make changes to the way it's governed. I think that's maybe an opportunity for the city manager and the staff to see it. Are there ways to improve it that are outside of the mandated functions of the charter?\nSpeaker 3: But we've had a I mean, just dozens and dozens of people from all across our community who have honorably served in that commission. And I want to thank them tonight for for serving for for their commitment to to this voter approved body.\nSpeaker 3: I'm from that was created. But I also want to be very clear moving forward that I do believe it's time for change. And I do believe that we have an opportunity and a unique opportunity to look at really creating a model commission or system.\nSpeaker 3: And I think that what we've heard tonight is a variety of of different ways of doing it. I think you heard that certainly we could go to to the route of of improving it internally through through staff process.\nSpeaker 3: There's certainly opportunities to look at is this the right type of body that should it should exist in in this area should be different. And certainly the the one that I think is the most democratic, which is a change at the ballot box, which makes something very permanent, is a is a charter change or a municipal code\nSpeaker 3: change that would really change the way this commission functions and the way that the people on the commission interact with the body. And I will just say that I think this you know, this council has a has a record of a charter changes in charter commissions.\nSpeaker 3: We just went through a process last year where this city went all in on on charter change, on creating a new city ethics commission on on on redistricting, on so many issues. And so I think that if we do this and as we begin this process, I encourage us to listen.\nSpeaker 3: Let's go to the community. Let's hear from our staff and from our departments what works, what doesn't work. And then let's and then let's really make create something that's a model and that we can really be proud of as a city and really meet the legacy of Congressman Lowenthal, of of then Councilman Lowenthal, who began this work\nSpeaker 3: with with the mission of really community oriented oversight and engagement. So I think I believe that we can do that and and we'll be all in on this process and make sure that we get it just right. So, Councilman Austin, I also trust that as as the one councilmember that has served on this commission, you're going to\nSpeaker 3: have valuable insight as well. So I look forward to your leadership in this process. And so with that, let's go out and take a roll call vote. Thank you. District by.\nSpeaker 0: District one.\nSpeaker 1: II.\nSpeaker 0: District two.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 0: District three.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 0: District four.\nSpeaker 5: I.\nSpeaker 0: District five.

Please read item.\nSpeaker 3: Report from Development Services Recommendation to receive and file a report on the results of the Nuisance Motel pilot program by the Office of Civic Innovation and Development Services Department, and request City Attorney to prepare an ordinance to establish a nuisance motel program citywide.\nSpeaker 10: Would you like to do a public comment on this or you. We just had to start reporting this. Yeah. Oh, fine. Grahamstown report, please.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Tracy calling the.\nSpeaker 8: Honorable vice mayor and City Council. In October of 2018, the Innovation Team coordinated an interdepartmental team to explore strategies to reduce nuisance activities at motels, as well as those motels that affect quality of life in their surrounding community.\nSpeaker 8: We partnered closely with the city prosecutor, city Attorney's Office, Development Services, Health and Human Services, Police, Fire and Financial Management to develop a task force to look at these particular properties, as well as develop procedures and recommendations to reduce criminal activity and nuisance on those property locations.\nSpeaker 8: We really want to thank all involved departments for their commitment to tackling these issues. This multidisciplinary approach to solving such an important problem really came in handy in working together. The staff report includes a compendium of the work that we've completed over this last year together, as well as recommendations for moving forward.\nSpeaker 8: I would like to turn it over to Oscar Orsi, our deputy director, and Alejandro Sanchez Lopez, a planner from both from Development Services Department, to provide the rest of the report.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, honorable Mayor and members of the City Council. This presentation serves as the final update to Council on the Nuisance motel's pilot program due to the program's results, which I will cover shortly. Staff is recommending to move forward with an ordinance that codifies a nuisance motel compliance plan and establishes a review process for all hospitality locations\nSpeaker 5: in Long Beach. Finally, staff also research other programs and policies to address nuisance motels and bolster the ordinance effectiveness. In 2017, staff first examined data from Long Beach Police Department analyzing calls for service.\nSpeaker 2: And incident report levels at all hospitality locations in the city between January 2014 and May 2017. After the pilot program was first implemented, a second data analysis of police activity.\nSpeaker 5: From May 2017 to.\nSpeaker 2: May 2018 was conducted to determine the overall effect of the pilot program at.\nSpeaker 5: The six selected locations. As a reminder, the two data sets were analyzed separately and weighed by activity type. They were then combined into a single index or score and given a standardized score out of 100, then accounted for the number of rooms at each location.\nSpeaker 5: Finally, staff selected six locations out of the top 15 scores for the initial pilot program based on size, spatial clustering, site history and other contextual factors. These locations are the Colonia Motel, the Greenlee, the luxury in the Sewer Motel, the Stallion Motel and Travelodge.\nSpeaker 5: Following the establishment of the pilot.\nSpeaker 2: Program, the interdepartmental task force coordinated with the pilot program hotels to implement nuisance and crime abatement procedures such as environmental design features, lighting and safety improvements and additional private security on site.\nSpeaker 5: These procedures were developed, assess research and adopted practices.\nSpeaker 2: From other jurisdictions and programs. Concurrently, staff also presented research.\nSpeaker 5: Conducted research on long term policy solutions to address the use of motels to pair with a compliance plan. The results of this three pronged approach is evident with the data that follows. Firstly, when looking at police activity, hotels and motels citywide, we did not see much change from the pilot program transaction.\nSpeaker 5: Effectively, we saw no change in the control group that is all locations across the city for the program, as calls for service levels remained relatively stable.\nSpeaker 2: However, when looking at only the six pilot locations, we saw a significant reduction of about 30% in calls for service levels, going from nearly 230 calls for service in the three years pilot prior to the program to about 160 quarterly calls for service.\nSpeaker 5: And perhaps more significantly calls for service levels job that all six locations. Anecdotally the locations that work most closely with the city team to implement the compliance plan experience the greatest drop in calls for service.\nSpeaker 2: As a result. As a result of the program's success, staff is recommending that we move forward with the Nuisance Motel ordinance. The audience will consolidate the existing regulations that affect hospitality locations in the city. It will codify the best practices from other jurisdictions that staff identified and piloted and establish an intercontinental action team to implement and monitor\nSpeaker 2: compliance of the ordinance regulations and identify development services as the lead agencies. Lead agencies for the Action Team Coordination and Ordinance Compliance Excellence. In addition to the recommended ordinance, staff pursuant to counsel's direction, have researched additional policies and programs to address nuisance motels, focusing in particular to a longer range solution that can come back the structural factors\nSpeaker 2: that lead to nuisance and criminal activity. These include motel conversions, zoning regulations, amortization and motel acquisition for motel conversion staff research the interim model excuse me, motel conversion ordinance from the city of Los Angeles, which allows for a ministerial approval process of temporary conversions to supportive housing that can be scaled on a citywide basis.\nSpeaker 2: A similar program in Long Beach could allow for applicable motels to be converted to permanent supportive housing on a temporary basis. Staff also researched, and this type of ordinance, coincidentally, could be something that we could develop by second quarter of next year.\nSpeaker 2: Staff also researched zoning regulations to discontinue motel uses in certain parts of the city, most notably the plan in North Long Beach could be that could designate motel uses as legally non-conforming use as meaning that they would no longer be allowed to operate after a certain period of time.\nSpeaker 2: This could be a more immediate step that would also serve as a precursor to additional regulations. As the Council is aware, the the plan is now moving forward and should be completed by the fourth quarter of next year.\nSpeaker 2: An additional tool that staff considered is the amortization or the phasing out of motel users. As most of you know, the amortization would terminate motel uses completely within a given period of time. That period of time is typically assessed through a study that allows the either businesses or the property owners to be whole of their investment.\nSpeaker 2: In order for us to move forward, we would need to identify revenue resources to be able to prepare the study and that direction would be needed from the council. An additional program that is essentially on a case by case basis is the acquisition of motels in order for this resource to be moved forward.\nSpeaker 2: Obviously, we would need revenue resources as well as the opportunity for vacancies or opportunities to purchase motels. This would allow the city the flexibility to redevelop the motels to either a supportive or additional housing or other commercial ventures.\nSpeaker 2: In conclusion, staff recommends that the City Council request the city attorney to prepare an ordinance to establish nuisance and motel program. This concludes staff's presentation, and we look forward to answering any questions that you may have.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item? Look what you can learn about this world. Excuse me. We'll go behind the guy's house first. Comes from noticing.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Vice Mayor. So so first I want to thank the entire team, the multi departmental team that worked on this pilot. This was in response to a call from the community to find some short term and long term solutions, specifically for the Long Beach Boulevard corridor.\nSpeaker 4: But that widened in the pilot was extended to, you know, six, six motels citywide. And I think the fact that we can and we've all watched this process, you know, in fact, just raise your hand if you've been following this process from the beginning.\nSpeaker 4: So there's a number of people who've been, you know, following this process to come back and say that we looked at the control group and then the pilot group, and they've seen a 30 plus percent drop in calls for service.\nSpeaker 4: I think that shows that give this additional attention. Attention has been working. And so I'm glad that we use the data to demonstrate the results of this pilot. And so I'm supportive of moving forward on the recommended recommendation to move forward with an actual ordinance.\nSpeaker 4: I like the I like the approach that we did a pilot. We evaluated the pilot. And then we move forward with creating the law. This is the same approach that we did with the Alcohol Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, and that's been a success.\nSpeaker 4: And, you know, it's been recognized as a as a best practice. And I like that we took that approach here. So I support that. And I'm going then within my motion request, I'm so concurring support for establishing this ordinance.\nSpeaker 4: The second thing I want to pull out is the mention of, you know, beginning the conversation on streamlining the motel conversion process and creating that ordinance similar to Los Angeles. And Oscar, you mentioned that this could be possible, possibly done in Q2 of 2018.\nSpeaker 4: I'd like to include in my motion to move forward on on that process based on the timeline that you presented, the Q two for the conversion, I think that makes sense, gives us enough time to move forward and work for next few months on this ordinance before moving on to next.\nSpeaker 4: And then additionally, we mentioned both the, the, the zoning approaches with a plan. I'm very comfortable with that. That's beginning the long term conversation. And we said we want to be very clear about short term, immediate solutions, but also addressing the long term problem that there's, you know, a concentration on this one corridor.\nSpeaker 4: And we need to talk about what the core of the vision for the corridor in the future. And I think that is appropriate in the land use document. So thank you for that. But the other the last thing that stood out was the fact that in order to pursue amortization is going to require additional study beyond the\nSpeaker 4: capacity that what we have. And so I would ask that we don't leave it there, that we do forwarded to city staff into the Budget Oversight Committee to think about this, because we looked at amortization as a solution citywide, not just for North Long Beach, but when you have outdated out, you know, when you have corridors with\nSpeaker 4: multiple motels, you know, Long Beach Boulevard, for example, as motels were in place before the 17 freeway had very different use. And, you know, the land use didn't keep up when the 710 was built. And so now you have these outdated land uses that we may need a tool like amortization to address.\nSpeaker 4: And the same is, you know, the case on other corridors like, you know, PCH or Anaheim, you know, some of the other corridors where these motels were. So I'm going to add the third thing here is to refer to the Budget Oversight Committee and to to and city manager to evaluate potential funding solutions in the next fiscal\nSpeaker 4: year's budget if available. So again, this is this is amazing work. I'm very proud of this work. We're going to be talking about this with with the Long Beach Boulevard community very soon. And many of them are here to follow this.\nSpeaker 4: But I think this is a good, important step and we've made some incredible progress. Thanks a lot.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you, Councilman Richardson. Councilwoman Pierce.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. Yes. I want to thank Scott for their work on this. I think the numbers on some of the graphs are are very telling. On Councilmember Richardson's third note around the acquisitions, where we get funding for I know that we've amortization.\nSpeaker 9: I just looked at acquisitions because it was in front of me. Thank you. The idea of getting these motels into being some housing solutions, I know that we've talked a lot about villages of Cabrillo, and I wanted to ask staff if they've had any conversations with them in regards to this motel item.\nSpeaker 2: We have not.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. I've had a couple conversation. We can talk offline, but they basically have been building up funds to be able to go out and purchase properties like this. So yes, we as a city need to identify funds that we can use.\nSpeaker 9: But I think there are some entities in the city that are willing to step in immediately, that they're actually out there scouting properties right now, that if we had a motel that fell into one of these categories might not be on our we might not need to spend our taxpayer money to do that, but we could rely\nSpeaker 9: on some of our community partners to do that. But I definitely think that this has been a great model. I think had some questions on what's the pilot program? What exactly did you guys do to get some of these numbers down all the way?\nSpeaker 9: It says that you guys monitored, but maybe I missed it. Sorry.\nSpeaker 2: Well, the pilot program consisted of, again, multiple disciplines from throughout the city, meeting with the property owners on a regular basis, identifying potential improvements to the way either in security and signing and their operational characteristics that would allow them to reduce their calls for service.\nSpeaker 2: And we would meet with them on a regular basis to to check to make sure that those items were implemented. It's a menu list, if you will, a compliance plan, a list of items customized to each hotel. And those items would actually help improve the way they operate their business and hence reduce the calls for service.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you for that. And just refresh my memory. I know that when the Human Trafficking Task Force started some of their work here in the city, that some of that had to do with signage in hotels. Did that include these motels as well?\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 5: There was staff from the health department that went on site visits and spoke with motel managers and owners regarding human trafficking and putting up signage. That's more of a recommendation, but it's something that we're looking to integrate more fully as a compliance plan looks forward.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. Thank you. Fully support this. Think it's great work.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you. Yes. Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you so much and great work to staff. I'm glad we as Councilmember Richardson said, I'm glad we started with the pilot and now we're moving towards an ordinance. And the first, we personally have lots of unfortunate motels along PCH, a few off Alamitos and Seventh Street.\nSpeaker 8: So I'm looking forward to seeing how those sort of interplay with with the ordinance and where we can get some some progress on those PCH. And it has been a major issue. It actually has deterred businesses from receiving ABC licenses.\nSpeaker 8: The businesses are really good standing, but the crime and areas around it, because the motels are such, you know, for poor behavior has really deter them from getting licenses, unfortunately. So just something to put out there. But relative to the presentation you had mentioned 15 locations, six of them that were piloted.\nSpeaker 8: What were the other locations and do we have? Addresses on them. I had to look up the locations you had in the presentation just online. But what were the other locations? Do you have just that information?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. So the other nine locations from the original study were the Grace Hotel, the Slumber Inn Motel, the Palms Motel, the Liberty Motel, the Belmont Sure Inn Motel, the Rocky Inn Motel, the Inn of Long Beach, the All eight motel.\nSpeaker 2: And the Royal Inn Motel.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, very fancy names, right? Royal and luxury. I love it. Nothing. But if we can get that list. I don't know if it was in the. I didn't. Oh, was it in the original presentation? Okay, great. Then I'll go ahead and look at that.\nSpeaker 8: That's great. As far as an enforcement mechanism, I know the ordinance. I know there's an action team that will be put in place. But is there any other sort of enforcement mechanism? I know in the past we've done, you know, calls for service that could be charged to the owner.\nSpeaker 8: What other sort of enforcement mechanisms are we exploring?\nSpeaker 2: So some of the the.\nSpeaker 5: Mechanisms that have been research are related to citations, charges for police activity and increased calls for service levels. And some of the compliance measures are actually already within the municipal code. So this would kind of centralize them and make motel managers and owners aware of everything that they already have to comply with and then any additional regulations\nSpeaker 5: that would come down the pipeline as well.\nSpeaker 2: These and these items would be subject to citation as well as city prosecutor.\nSpeaker 8: Great. Another two questions. So outreach about the program. So once the ordinance comes into play, I would love for us to I want all of the motels to know that this ordinance is alive and good so they could hopefully change their practices.\nSpeaker 8: What are we thinking about that?\nSpeaker 2: The the idea is, is to establish a marketing campaign once the council approves the ordinance and and be able to communicate that to all the the hospitality establishments, especially those that are near or over the thresholds for calls for service and to again, solicit input from the community as well as the hotel.\nSpeaker 2: Hoteliers should be able to discuss the compliance plan and move that forward before we begin the compliance planning efforts.\nSpeaker 8: Okay, great. And last question and I had this question before when we had the conversation about bad actor landlords, about future projects. I know a lot of these property owners, they may come to Planning Commission and they have a brand new project.\nSpeaker 8: And oftentimes we as council members or planning commissioners don't know that they have a problem with Project A, but now they have a brand new project that they want to build or they just think there's got to be something that we as a council body should know of, that they have issues.\nSpeaker 8: Sometimes we don't. We often don't know about that unless we dig into the details and research that. But I'm just wondering if there's anything that could be flagged for us knowing that, you know, they may want to own multiple properties or have, you know, another copy or another permit of some sort, and that we at least know\nSpeaker 8: that before going into a decision and making a decision on a new property.\nSpeaker 5: So that's actually one of the first research efforts that we undertook as this will be housed primarily within development services. We fortunately have the greatest amount of access to property ownership information. We're looking to include that in some way and mitigate any issue there on back end data gathering to make sure that we understand the full context\nSpeaker 5: of of these sites, that property owners and property managers that may be related to other sites or to other nuisance issues throughout the city are included within whatever efforts that we have going forward.\nSpeaker 8: Great. I think thank you very much for that and great work again.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 4: Just wanted to clarify, the funding that we talked about was the 150 K referenced in here as a need to evaluate the amortization piece. Just just to be clear, between that and funding for conversion. Thanks.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Did you have a chance to do public commentary on this? Any public comment on this case? None. So there is a motion at a second on the floor. Please call the roll call.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Supernova. All right. Councilwoman Mongo I. Vice Mayor Andrews. So for me.\nSpeaker 1: I have.\nSpeaker 3: It. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. When you.

Just the next item on the agenda.\nSpeaker 0: Item two, I was communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Spano, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Turanga. Recommendation to require a city manager to develop a free voluntary bike registration program by partnering with Project 5 to 9.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. I can have everyone just say we're going to keep moving the agenda as we exit. So please. Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 6: I'm not. Is there anyone left from public works that might be able to.\nSpeaker 1: Speak about this?\nSpeaker 4: I know Mr. Beck is here. Do we want to grab Mr. Beck? We're going to grab Mr.. Mr.. Beck.\nSpeaker 1: This is a quick one.\nSpeaker 6: Well, I'll go ahead and get started since I think our colleagues have probably read the TFF already, but I'm glad to be bringing this item back before the City Council to establish a city wide bike registration program. As you may recall, I brought the initial item before council asking staff to provide a report on the feasibility of\nSpeaker 6: developing a free online voluntary bicycle registration program. They Richards staff returned with a report on March the eighth recommending that a bike registration organization called Project 5 to 9 would offer the greatest ability to deliver a robust, low cost bicycle registry program to our residents.\nSpeaker 6: Since 2011, the city has not required registration of bicycles. The registration program was cumbersome and difficult for residents to comply with. However, today, bicycle thefts are serious and growing concern throughout Long Beach. So a new approach is needed.\nSpeaker 6: Currently, many residents do not record this information for their bicycles, so if their bicycle is stolen, they are unable to provide the police department with detailed information that could result in the return of the bicycle. Additionally, if a bicycle is registered.\nSpeaker 1: The.\nSpeaker 6: Police department would be better able to proactively return stolen bikes to their owners when they are found, as well as prosecute those committing bike thefts. The police department currently has a large number of recovered bicycles that are unregistered, with no way of contacting the owners.\nSpeaker 6: And free and voluntary online bike registration programs.\nSpeaker 1: Will give.\nSpeaker 9: The police.\nSpeaker 6: Department a better chance of returning stolen bikes and confronting the.\nSpeaker 1: Bike theft problem head.\nSpeaker 6: On. Addressing bike thefts has become a big focus for me because every day we see bikes stolen and there is little the police can do to address this. If they cannot prove ownership of a bike and the crime goes unreported, stolen bikes are chronically used as currency for drug purchases, primarily the drugs that we've seen them used\nSpeaker 6: for purchases for as heroin and methamphetamine. So bike registration gives police an important tool to fight a number of issues, while also improving our ability to return bikes to their owners. The costs for us to be involved in this program is minimal, considering that we're servicing a city of 500,000 residents.\nSpeaker 6: And I see that Mr. Becker's here. So I don't know if Mr. Beck wants to offer any additional comments that I didn't cover.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Apologize. Yes. I think moving forward with an online bicycle program is the best approach. We have worked with our colleagues in the police department. They are very supportive of going in this direction and we look forward to getting it up and running for the community in.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. I don't have any further comments. I ask my colleagues to support us. This is, in my opinion, as as our city manager often says, motherhood and apple pie. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilmember Supernormal.\nSpeaker 4: I support.\nSpeaker 3: This item.\nSpeaker 4: Wholeheartedly.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Andrew.\nSpeaker 11: Yes. And I want to thank Councilman Price for bringing this item, you know, to the diary, because the free bicycle registration program, I think it's a step in the right direction because we always kind of brag about our Long Beach bike friendly city.\nSpeaker 11: But our infrastructure is intact. Isn't the most effective regarding bike ownership or theft? You know, I believe a streamlined process for this registration will support our recovery effort and hopefully encourage more residents to ride their bikes. So I'm excited about seeing this progress in program, you know, coming to action.\nSpeaker 11: Thank you, Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you.

Monday, December 5th. Okay. Um. It's been moved has not been seconded. Okay. It's been moved in. Second comments. Councilman Espinosa. So this is a companion bill to the I mean, I had general questions and I'm sorry, I apologize to everyone.\nSpeaker 0: I the date that we were obligated with the 30 day shot clock was the 12th on this one and the 19th on the other one. I wasn't intending to sort of interfere with other other with the project in particular.\nSpeaker 0: So I think it's a it's a reasonable compromise to just switch it to a seven day period rather than a 14 day period. And just hopefully Jeff and.\nSpeaker 4: Company can can.\nSpeaker 0: Get with me right away. Okay. Councilman Herndon. Thank you, Mr. President. A question for Jeff. I was just and I didn't know Kathryn Lopez chimed up earlier. I didn't know if I was going to ask him. I just was curious, is on the west side if this was necessary?\nSpeaker 0: I was just trying to figure that out. So that was I. I just want to get to my councilman. Lopez wanted to chime in on that, Mr. President. So I'm from L.A. I'm just curious, I thought. Guzman-Lopez you to chime time and I do not see Jeff Steinberg.\nSpeaker 5: You know, I, you know there's you're going to see a series if I, if I can. Mr. President. I'm sorry. I don't want to speak out.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 5: You're going to see a series.\nSpeaker 0: I'll go and look at this. From Public Works. And I think you want to wait till she goes or you want to.\nSpeaker 5: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Angela, kasey dec public works. Are you asking if this easement is necessary to go through? What? What is the. Is there a question about the easement?\nSpeaker 0: Mine was. Yeah. So just the stopping this how does that the as we start this walking down this path, delaying this, does that have an impact? If we were we're delaying this one vote a week. How does this impact that?\nSpeaker 0: I was just going to make sure that wasn't something.\nSpeaker 3: I mean, if they if they needed to move forward, they could do that without the easement. It would they would just it would cause an extra step.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And then that's that's just my my concern as a president. That's why I was curious of Councilmember Lopez since he spoke up before, had a concern about that, just delaying for the sake of delay. I know Councilman Espinosa wanted to line it up.\nSpeaker 0: I just wanted to know if what we're if we're possibly missing something. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Councilor Lopez.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Mr. President. Look, I am not a person to just shy away from questions and making sure that all questions are answered. But here's the thing. With Federal Boulevard, it's been in the works for a very long time.\nSpeaker 5: There's a lot of moving parts as a lot of different parcels, a lot of different acquisitions, a lot of different things happening. Just and just for folks who understand what this is about, it's adding that northbound lane. It's putting a median down federal boulevard.\nSpeaker 5: Undergrounding utilities, widening the sidewalks, putting trees on some side of it. You know, you want to be able to make federal boulevard walkable and safe. It is one of the it was at 1.1 of the most dangerous strips in the whole state.\nSpeaker 5: With that being said, there's a lot of businesses here that have parking lot issues that, you know, whenever we start doing something like this, it literally it's it's throwing a ball bearing into the machine and it could have some unintended consequences.\nSpeaker 5: What I don't want to see happen is some of these unintended consequences, being incumbent upon, you know, businesses and, you know, and work hours and things like that. So, you know, I think if you have questions, ask questions.\nSpeaker 5: This is a this is something that's ongoing. You're going to see a lot of these bills come through. That has to do with this with this project. It's part of a bigger it's part of bigger picture of what we want to see is this move forward as fast as possible.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And Alexis.\nSpeaker 3: So I just want to clarify for this that this is a utility easement. So we're removing the easement for utilities at this location on a specific area. And so all of those utilities have been moved as part of this project.\nSpeaker 3: So there's no there's no controversy. There's no there's no everything's been resolved as far as the easement goes. So, I mean, holding it back is not I mean, there's no there's not any significance to that.\nSpeaker 0: I think that's what we need to. I appreciate that. Okay. Council members, we are going to vote on the postponement right now. If the postponement fails, we will then vote again to put this on final consideration and do pass.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. It's been moved in second it. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I just want to sort of help my colleague. I mean, I think we all understand it, but I just want to clarify that the two bills that I did that I called out are they're only dealing with a very defined piece of property that that is only related\nSpeaker 0: to the construction of the new headquarters, not, you know. Well, it might have tangential impact. I mean, relationship to other work does see that as doing you know, we're only talking about things that are within the property lines of that parcel that will then contain the new headquarters in their parking structure like not roadways.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. We're again voting on the postponement of Council Bill 1078. Madam Secretary, Raquel Espinosa Flynn.\nSpeaker 1: No Gilmore. No. Herndon, no. Cashman can each. Lopez? No.\nSpeaker 3: Ortega, I.\nSpeaker 1: Susman.

Councilmember Clerk, will you please put Council Bill 20 Dash 1477 on the floor for passage?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, Council President. I move that council bill 1477 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.\nSpeaker 1: It has been moved and we've got the second by councilman herndon. The required public hearing for council bill 20 dash 1477 is open. May we have the staff report?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. I just mean it. Okay. Can you see that?\nSpeaker 3: Mm hmm. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Awesome. Well, I am Libby with an IEEE, and I'll be presenting the application for 4144 Hooker Street. This application is located in Council District one in Councilwoman Sandoval's district. In the Berkeley neighborhood. More specifically, it's located within the Harkness Heights portion of Berkeley.\nSpeaker 5: The apples are. The property is located on Hooker Street between 41st and 42nd Avenues. It's approximately 6250 square feet and is occupied by a single unit home. The property is currently in the urban single unit C Zone District and the applicant is proposing to rezone to a district that allows for an ADU USC C one.\nSpeaker 5: As stated previously, the existing zone district is urban, urban single unit C, which allows the Urban House primary building form and typically has a minimum zone lot size of 5500 square feet. And all the other properties within the Harkness Heights that are residential are also zoned to us, you see.\nSpeaker 5: The current use is single unit residential. Most of the surrounding area and within Harkness Heights is also a single unit. There are a small number of two unit and motel unit in the area, however. This slide shows the existing form and scale.\nSpeaker 5: The upper right hand side is the existing home, and then the left are other single unit uses on the block. And as you can see, this particular block is all single unit uses. This MAP amendment was complete in the beginning of October.\nSpeaker 5: A postcard notifying property owners within 200 feet of the site was sent out on October six. To date, we have received six comments. Five are opposed to the proposed rezoning, citing concerns with parking, affordability and infrastructure capacity. And we did receive one comment that was in support of the request.\nSpeaker 5: And then additionally we received a comment from the Berkeley Radius United Neighbors. R.A., along with Harkness Heights Neighborhood Association, sent a survey to neighboring property owners, and they received feedback that eight property owners were in support of the request and then 13 were were opposed.\nSpeaker 5: The Arnaud's are unable to release information on why the property owners were either supportive or oppose and because they did not do a permission to release comments in the survey. And so I don't quite have that information. But a member of the Brun Zoning and Planning Committee said that there were concerns over the current configuration of the\nSpeaker 5: buildings on the site and then in the parking. The Denver zoning code has five review criteria which must be met for approval, and I'll go through each one. So the first is consistency with adopted plans, of which there are two that are applicable to this site.\nSpeaker 5: The first is comprehensive plan 2040. And so for this one, there are two strategies that are applicable. First, this rezoning will create a greater mix of housing options in the Berkeley, particularly the Harkness Heights area, for all individuals and families.\nSpeaker 5: And then second, it will promote infill development where there's already infrastructure, such as water and sewer in place. And in Blueprint Denver, the future neighborhood context is urban. These areas are characterized by one and two unit residential areas, with some mixed use and multi-unit embedded throughout.\nSpeaker 5: BLOCK patterns are regular, and there's a high degree of walkability. Blueprint identifies this property as a low residential place type is place types are mostly single and two unit uses and accessory dwelling units are appropriate and can be thoughtfully integrated in the future.\nSpeaker 5: Street type for Hooker is a with an undesignated local which is mostly characterized by residential uses, so their request is zoned district to you. As you see, one would be consistent with this low residential guidance and the future street type.\nSpeaker 5: The growth area and blueprint. Denver is all other areas of the city. This is where we anticipate to see 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040. Again, this is consistent with the rezoning to allow for an avenue because it will allow a limited amount of density that is consistent with the all other areas\nSpeaker 5: of the city growth strategy. Blueprint also identifies civic policy recommendations. The land use and built environment housing policy for states that individual rezonings to allow eighties are appropriate and should be small and area. And that's exactly what this rezoning is.\nSpeaker 5: It's just a single property to allow for an you. That also finds the requested rezoning meets the next two criteria the rezoning will result. And and further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through its implementation of adopted plans and by providing a new housing type in a largely single unit area.\nSpeaker 5: Staff finds there's a justifying circumstance for this MAP amendment with the newly adopted guidance for Adams and throughout all Denver residential neighborhoods that's found in Blueprint Denver. And lastly, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context, the residential zoned district, general purpose and the specific intent of the USC see one zoned district.\nSpeaker 5: Therefore, based on the review criteria, staff recommends approval of rezoning. And that concludes my presentation and I know the applicants are also on AM if you'd like to ask them questions to.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you very much, Libby, for the great presentation. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 20 Dash 1477. We have three individuals signed up to speak this evening, and the first speaker is Christine Roe, who is the applicant.\nSpeaker 1: I had. Please, Christine.\nSpeaker 3: I'm connected.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening.\nSpeaker 3: My name is Christine Roe, and we are requesting to resign our property at four men for four Hooker Street to allow us to renovate our existing two story garage. When we bought our house 20 years ago, one of the things that drove to it was this two story brick crutch in the back.\nSpeaker 3: Although the structure was 100 years old.\nSpeaker 5: It had electrical.\nSpeaker 3: Outdated water and a sewer connection. Research at the laboratory shows the first floor garages original and the second floor was addition was built about nine years ago and in 1921. We've always wanted update the structure and started looking into what it would take to legally fix it up a few years ago.\nSpeaker 5: Our goal is to have an updated.\nSpeaker 3: Structure with an office in the apartment upstairs and a storage space downstairs. Our existing house, including a small edition completed 12 years ago that was permanent through the city.\nSpeaker 5: Walls and four.\nSpeaker 3: Floors under the required building lot coverage allowance. We do not intend to increase the footprint of our existing garage. During the planning.\nSpeaker 5: Board meeting, concerns about parking and traffic in our neighborhood. But rather I just want to note that our.\nSpeaker 3: House has a driveway that easily accommodates two vehicles and that our block has an average of about 8 to 10 vehicles parked on the street during the night evenings. Currently, there's two houses under construction, so we have seen or are not under construction but are having additions and so we are seeing more construction vehicles parked in front\nSpeaker 3: . But typically, I mean, I've been going out at night and just looking and you know, we averaged 8 to 10 cars out there every evening and we reached out to development services in early January and understand that if approved for an ADU, a next step would be to follow up with the city regarding all the design and\nSpeaker 3: code requirements for the existing structure. Again, we are requesting to design a property to allow an additional dwelling unit. Thanks for your time.\nSpeaker 5: And please ask any questions.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you, Christine. Our next speaker is Jesse Paris.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. Members of council, those watching at home. My name is Jessica Sean Paris and I'm representing a Denver homeless out loud, black star action movies for self-defense, positive African-American for social change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile High Knowles, along with from allies to abolitionists.\nSpeaker 2: And I will be the next mayor of Denver for. 2020. Three. I'm in favor and so eloquently stated and meets all the five of my.\nSpeaker 1: See, Jesse, your Wi-Fi connection.\nSpeaker 2: Just to see what adaptive plans.\nSpeaker 1: We don't need you to turn your video off.\nSpeaker 2: The.\nSpeaker 1: We're not able to hear your audio and fortunately, Jesse. We might have to have you turn your video off so that we can get a better Wi-Fi connection with your audio.\nSpeaker 2: Can you hear me now?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we can hear you better now. Oh. Okay. It looks like we might have lost. Jesse but we'll try to get him back in the queue. Or Jesse, if you want to go ahead and move, we'll try to get the rest of your testimony in.\nSpeaker 1: Go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: So I was just saying that meets all five of the criteria, which is listing out the criteria. I think I left off on criteria three, which is, uh, further public health and safety and welfare justify circumstances, consistency with neighborhood contexts, residential zoned, district purpose and intense.\nSpeaker 2: So saying that this meets all five of the criteria, I'm going to be in favor of the rezoning tonight. The job of Mount Istanbul. I just wanted to know how many of these rezonings have been passed within the last year in District one.\nSpeaker 2: If you can answer that question, I'll greatly appreciate it. Thank you and have a good night.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you, Jesse. Our last speaker is Tess Storti.\nSpeaker 5: Hi there. Um. Hi. I just wanted to. Ask some questions about access to these public comments. And I know that, you know, the sign ups, the window is pretty short and tersely.\nSpeaker 1: We would ask that you speak directly to the bill that we're hearing tonight. It's 4144 Hooker Street. It's an Adu.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So if I. If I had wanted to sign up for. To comment on the edu regarding this rezoning, I'm just wondering how I would have done that if I had a disability. I'm a special ed teacher. And so I was just wondering how someone with a hearing or vision impairment would be able to have seen that\nSpeaker 5: . City Planners PowerPoint because people that use visual overlays for seeing screens can't see shared screens. So access to the city planners presentation would have been impossible. So I'm just curious about access to some of these. And if I needed additional accommodations under the ADA, how I would have been able to get them in such a short amount\nSpeaker 5: of time, given that the signup was so short and connecting to services would likely take much longer than the 10 minutes or so that we have to sign up. So I just have some questions about access under the ADA.\nSpeaker 5: Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: All right. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. All right. Seen no questions from members of council. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1477 is closed. Comments by Members of Council Councilwoman Sandoval.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you, Madam President. So. Harkness Heights is a very unique area in northwest Denver, and it's gone under a little bit of a different planning process. In a few weeks, you will see me bring a conservation overlay for this area that we have been working on for about two predates me so effective Bernice's time so probably for\nSpeaker 5: about five years so that there is more outreach to this particular accessory dwelling unit than the last A.D. that you saw, which they're both in the statistical neighborhood of Berkeley. But Harkness Heights is its own R.A. within an R.A. And so due to that fact, they have had some more robust outreach, actually, that conservation overlay for $300\nSpeaker 5: going to the planning board this coming Wednesday. So I'm familiar with this site and I know that Adus, as we all know, are somewhat controversial in some parts of the neighborhood. And Harkness Heights has worked really hard on this overlay, and we did not create standards for an overlay within this, that we did not create standards for\nSpeaker 5: the ADOS and the overlay. So there's some conversations moving forward that we are going to probably have to go back on. But given that we are voting on this criteria, I just wanted you all to have the back story of why there was a little bit more robust outreach on this application prior to the one that we\nSpeaker 5: heard at the beginning of the night. I do believe it meets the standards and all five of them, and I do think that they are going to do a good job of doing adaptive reuse and adding any type of gentle density into our neighborhood is always a good thing.\nSpeaker 5: So to answer your question, Jesse, I don't know the exact number of accessory dwelling units that were voted on in 2020. I led an application for Chaffee Park so I can get that. If you want to email my office, I can have some research done for my staff.\nSpeaker 5: Naomi I have no problem helping you find out that information. I just don't know what off the top of my head, but I just wanted to enter that question for everybody. And with that, I would ask my colleagues to support you for your support on this application.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Sandoval, and happy to support this one as well because it meets the review criteria and seen no other comments by members of council. Madam Secretary, roll call.\nSpeaker 3: Sandoval.\nSpeaker 5: I. Sawyer, I.\nSpeaker 3: Torres. I.\nSpeaker 0: Black Eye. CdeBaca, I. Clark. Right. Flynn.\nSpeaker 4: I.\nSpeaker 0: Herndon, I.

An ordinance relating to the Department of Neighborhoods authorizing implementation of certain neighborhood matching fund projects in 2016 and specifying that 2016 appropriations for the neighborhood matching sub fund shall carry forward automatically to future budget years.\nSpeaker 1: The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 2: And Burgess, thank you.\nSpeaker 4: This is an ordinance that authorizes the release of funds from our Neighborhood Matching Fund program. This is the large projects fund were allocated $650,000. Some of the projects that are being funded are the 2206 Zulu's Urbana Project, which will enable arts organizations in the Central District.\nSpeaker 4: Free access to the historic Washington Hall at 14th and Kessler for free public events south east effective development will build and equip a professional studio for Rainier Valley Radio.

These are some of the projects that will be funded by. Obviously the Beacon Hill folks are here. So the committee recommends adoption of this ordinance.\nSpeaker 2: Very good. Any further comments? Councilmember Herbold.\nSpeaker 1: I just want to say a few words. One of the things that we heard in committee when we were briefed about this fantastic slate of projects that was going to be coming forward for a recommendation for approval by the Council is the role that the district councils played in the selection of these projects and have historically played\nSpeaker 1: in the selection of neighborhood matching fund large grants as well as simple grants. And that that as a geographically based organization, it makes sense for some sort of geographically based organization, whether or not it's district councils or some other type of an organization to do an initial vetting of projects.\nSpeaker 1: And so we heard about how that has worked in the past, how that worked with this particular batch of projects and the role that the district councils played in this batch. And then we talked a little bit without asking the Department of Neighborhoods to reveal their hand too much about what were what we should expect for future\nSpeaker 1: recommendations coming out of them for neighborhood engagement. But we did receive an acknowledgment from D.O. and director Kathleen Eiland that even if not district councils, they do acknowledge that it is very important for some sort of a geographically based organization to have a vetting role in the selection of process projects before moving on for further and further\nSpeaker 1: further review. So I just wanted to sort of put a pin in that and share with other council members not at the table what we heard.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Catherine. Her vote. Any further comments?\nSpeaker 4: I would just reinforce what Councilmember Herbold said. This is not an easy process for people to go through. And a significant number of applicants were denied this year the funds that they sought because their application wasn't ready yet.\nSpeaker 4: And that was a process of not only the district council's, but also a citizen committee that works to evaluate the various applications that are submitted. So it's been a good process in terms of qualifying applicants for funding. But we also know that the positive impact that these dollars have in the community is way beyond what we even\nSpeaker 4: are aware of. We talked briefly in the committee about a research project that was done two years ago, unbeknownst to the city, or at least unbeknownst to me and most of my colleagues on the council by some university researchers that showed the very positive impact of this grassroots community engagement on neighborhood matching funds and the resulting reduction\nSpeaker 4: in crime in the areas where those funds were spent. So there's lots of reasons why the Council has always supported the Neighborhood Matching Fund program, and I'm confident we'll continue to do so going going forward.\nSpeaker 2: Councilman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 1: Just to dovetail off of the comments that have already been made. I understand I'm really excited to see that one of the grants will be going to One America and the Chinese Information and Service Center. And I'm not saying that just because I'm the past board chair of One America, though, that is influencing my opinion.\nSpeaker 1: But I think, you know, I think it's much more than just a digital story project. And to Councilmember Bridges this point, it is an investment in a community driven investment in a project and an opportunity to both tell those immigrant stories, but at the same time also help these new immigrants and sometimes longtime immigrants here in our\nSpeaker 1: community be able to learn English. And through my role as chair of the New Americans Committee, one of the things that we heard from the Office of Immigrant Refugee Affairs is that language is in the lack of English proficiency is the number one indicator of poverty and cycle of poverty for immigrants.\nSpeaker 1: And so this is a real opportunity to have a meaningful investment within two fantastic reputable grassroots nonprofit organizations that are already making a difference in our community. And with this investment, I think we signal, again, the city's commitment to invest in communities that have historically not been well invested in.\nSpeaker 1: So I'm going to be very excited to vote for the full package, but wanted to take a moment to highlight what the grant recommendation to One America and CIC means to me personally.\nSpeaker 2: Excellent. Please call the role on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 0: Gonzalez I. HERBOLD Hi, Johnson. O'Brien Sergeant Bagshaw. Burgess Hi. President Harrell. I aid in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 2: The bill passed and chair will sign it. Next item, please.\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Okay. Well, sorry. We're going to move to item number six, confirming the appointment of Gregory Beans to the King County for Culture Cultural Development Authority. Please come on up and set the table. The light in front of you is the white button and that'll turn on your microphone.\nSpeaker 0: But first I'll call on Leah crackles OPR Council staff to give a report.\nSpeaker 3: Good afternoon council members and is critical Darby Council Staff. The materials for this item begin on page 15 of your packet and this is a motion that would confirm Gregory Beames to the For Culture Board for a three year term expiring December 31st, 2019.\nSpeaker 3: I'm going to provide some brief background on the for culture board and the appointment process, and then I'll provide an introduction for Mr. Beames and the King County Council created for Culture King County's Cultural or Cultural Public Development Authority in 2002 in order to support, advocate for and preserve the cultural resources of the region in a manner\nSpeaker 3: that fosters excellence, vitality and diversity for culture is funded through a portion of the lodging tax revenues collected in King County. In addition for culture administers King County's public arts program, the 1%.\nSpeaker 0: For Art Program.\nSpeaker 3: And manages the King County Public Art.\nSpeaker 0: Collection.\nSpeaker 3: For culture is governed governed by a 15 member board of directors who are nominated by the King County Executive and confirmed by the King County Council. The composition of the For Culture Board is established by the For Culture Charter.\nSpeaker 3: The Charter requires that the Board of directors have a demonstrated commitment to and knowledge of cultural resources and be active and experienced in community and civic issues and concerns and have the available ability to evaluate the needs of cultural constituencies in the region as a whole, represent a range of talent, experiences, backgrounds and viewpoints, and be sought\nSpeaker 3: from a range of cultural, civic and business professions. Are residents of King County and reflect the geographic and cultural diversity of the county and have no more than six directors from any one municipal municipality. In addition, the board must include one of each of the following a director with expertize in the arts, a director with expertize in\nSpeaker 3: public art, a director with expertize in heritage, a director with expertize in his historic preservation, and a director from the business community. A board member served for terms of three years and may serve up to two consecutive full terms.\nSpeaker 3: In addition to the 15 board members, four culture has five ex-officio board members, which include one member of the executive staff and three county council members and four culture executive director. The Culture Board has a governance nominating committee that includes the ex-officio board members designated by the county executive and the County Council.\nSpeaker 3: And that committee is responsible for nominating candidates for appointment to the Board of directors after seeking community recommendations, the for culture board votes on the nominations made by the committee, and then those nominations are forwarded to the county executive who is responsible for appointing four culture board members.\nSpeaker 3: And then the County Council is responsible for confirming that board member members may serve, may begin serving upon confirmation by the Council or 30 days after their appointment, subject to subsequent council confirmation or rejection. And unless there are questions about the for culture board or appointment process, I'll next introduce Mr. Bean.\nSpeaker 4: Councilmember Gossett Thank you, Madam Chair. A few days ago we had a I think it was a law and justice committee meeting in. Sponsored quite a few members to the board for culture. And then one of the members of the Common Council said I'd are three or four or five members, all from your district and on board\nSpeaker 4: , all from District two. And I didn't really know the answer. So we had a little discussion about distribution of board members. And we also had challenges to that concept that it needs to be removed from every district. So it's hard and it's probably coincidental that two, three, four people from the same district are on the board.\nSpeaker 3: There can be up to six from one municipality, but it doesn't specify within which council districts. And so you couldn't have more than six from the city of Seattle, which your council district has and there aren't. But you could have a number from that council district of the nominating committee.\nSpeaker 3: And the executive and the council find that there are qualified members to serve.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: And it was my understanding, Councilmember, is that the way as as Leah said, that the way the charter sets this up is that there was a desire that the board have diversity, not all from the city of Seattle.\nSpeaker 0: And so the definition is no more than six from any one city, and that we have six from the city of Seattle on the board now. And the other nine or however many, I don't know how many vacancies there are today are from other places.\nSpeaker 0: So but it's a good question and worth addressing. Councilmember Lambert. Thank you. Since I'm one of the two districts that has nobody on this committee, that is very disconcerting to me. And I agree. We talked yesterday about the idea that isn't district wide, but it seems to me that there's 15 people that every district should have at\nSpeaker 0: least one person. So so the part here on page 15 is there no more than six directors, meaning one municipality that is in King County code or is that in the charter?\nSpeaker 3: That is in the four culture charter, which was initially adopted by the King County Council and could be amended, but it.\nSpeaker 0: Can't be amended. Yes. So I would like us to talk about taking that number from six down to four so we can talk about that. Who's on the governing nominating committee?\nSpeaker 3: Some of your colleagues sitting next to you.\nSpeaker 0: On the.\nSpeaker 3: OC are fired by the charter. Could be on the nominating committee.\nSpeaker 4: No, but you're done. What could be? It's like you're saying are.\nSpeaker 0: On it.\nSpeaker 3: According to the charter. That's what it should be. And he says You are.\nSpeaker 4: I'm on the nominating committee.\nSpeaker 1: By virtue of being. This is you only have 1/2.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Trying to maintain control of the meeting here for a second. Mr. Kelly, why don't you come up, turn on the microphone, introduce yourself for the record, and then you can please proceed to address the councilmembers question. Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Good afternoon. Members of the Council. I'm Jim Kelly, executive director for Culture. The fourth culture charter requires the three members of the King County Council serve as ex-officio members of the Four Culture Board. Currently, that is council members Baldacci, Gossett and Cole Wells.\nSpeaker 5: By virtue of your being ex-officio members of our board, you are on the board nominating committee. The board nominating committee includes all three ex-officio members from the council, the ex-officio member of the appointed by the executive, which is Jennifer Meissner and four members of the For Culture Board.\nSpeaker 5: And the charter also calls that the nominating committee be chaired by the four culture vice president. So vice president, three other board members, county council members, executive and myself serve as the nominating committee.\nSpeaker 4: Does it say in there that you're on the nominating.\nSpeaker 5: Committee because I'm an ex-officio member of the board? Yes.\nSpeaker 4: The executive director is a ex-officio member of the board. Okay. When when are these meetings going to.\nSpeaker 5: We've had we've already had one. We've had our first meeting already. You have been invited to that meeting and you will be invited to others if you can't attend. That doesn't mean you can't send a nomination over to us.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, but is this process going on now?\nSpeaker 5: Yes, because we have two openings that will occur on the board at the end of 2017. We have one board member who's completing two terms at the end of 2017, and we have a second board member who is moving in her fifth year of board service out of Kane County.\nSpeaker 5: So those two positions are open.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I would definitely like to know when the next meeting is. I didn't know that the charter calls for us to automatically be on a nominating committee, and I want to be a little more responsive to that request in the future.\nSpeaker 4: All right.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Bassett. Councilmember Caldwell's. Okay, Madam Chair, I'm not wanting to be circumspect or the opposite of that, but I. I also had not known that I was a member by accepting the exhibition status of the nominating committee.\nSpeaker 0: But I did receive an email three weeks ago or so alerting me to the meeting and that if I could not attend, that I could submit recommendations for or nomination. So I did do that. I submitted one person's name and so I would think the others got that to me.\nSpeaker 0: But we get so much email and we get so.\nSpeaker 5: We tend to seek your staff because it.\nSpeaker 0: Makes.\nSpeaker 5: You believe that you have time to open all our emails between you and you.\nSpeaker 0: But I do it faithfully here. You do their councilmember member. So I have in the past when I was an expedition member, put in names and so I'm very concerned just one district, we are the two that have nobody.\nSpeaker 0: And I just don't think that. That's right.\nSpeaker 5: Well, I totally agree. I have not a problem with that. One of our board members was actually appointed to the board as a resident of District one, and then she and her husband moved to District four. I'm sorry we couldn't control that.\nSpeaker 0: So I would hope that that and I will do something on my part to send out an email asking for people in my district this expertize. But if you could look for people in my district also that you have regular contact with, that would be wonderful because I really do believe that we have discussions around here about\nSpeaker 0: things like is a barn art or is it not? And, you know, it's very important, as you know, and people love it. So we need to have somebody at the table that has that part of the county in mind.\nSpeaker 0: Right. Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember, I'd also add that I recently saw their For Culture newsletter, their e-newsletter that goes out and the call for board members did specifically say they were looking for people from districts one and three.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent.\nSpeaker 5: I forgot to mention that.\nSpeaker 0: They say that you. I'm so glad. Well, thank you. Very good. Thanks, Councilmember. Go. Wells Madam Chair. Tim So what she just said about having had been a member from District one, but she and her husband moved to District Court, otherwise I would have not had any.\nSpeaker 5: That's here. You've got Kirsten.\nSpeaker 0: Powers. I just have one. And that apparently was she was appointed to justice.\nSpeaker 5: Right. So it was accurate when we reported that we have a restriction that no more than six board members can come from any one city. And it so happens the two board members who were leaving are not Seattleites.\nSpeaker 5: So those open up to positions. If the council wants to consider reducing that number to four, that's entirely up to you. That is a charter revision that you would have to do by motion or ordinance.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Like so, we have had a robust discussion about the structure of the board. We are here to appoint Mr. Beames. So welcome, Mr. Muzaffar. Thank you for being with us. Now you can sort of see the sausage being made here and how we how we engage with these issues.\nSpeaker 0: Can you just tell us a little bit about yourself and why you're interested.\nSpeaker 3: In you want me to go first introduction.\nSpeaker 0: What are you going to share? Okay, my notes here say ask him to introduce himself.\nSpeaker 3: So I'm just going to give his bio and then.\nSpeaker 0: Very good.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So Mr. Bean lives in Kirkland in District six. He's a coordinating partner at Ernst and Young and has 25 years experience providing audit services to public and private companies in a variety of technology and media fields. He's also a member of Ernst and Young Global Coordinating Partner Network and oversees Ernst and Young's Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of\nSpeaker 3: the Year awards program. Additionally, he's a board member for the Washington Technology Industry Association, where he serves as the finance chair and he has bachelor's degrees in finance and accounting from Central Washington University and is currently pursuing his master in fine arts degree.\nSpeaker 3: From the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Thank you. Now, if there's anything else you would like to tell us about yourself and and about your interest in serving on the Fort Culture Board, please welcome.\nSpeaker 5: And thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, I would say I actually completed my master's degree here this past December, and so I was fortunate enough to now have that in the bank and can spend time with my family again.\nSpeaker 0: Congratulations.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. The other thing I would tell the committee is I serve on various other nonprofit organization boards here in the community. I've joined the photographic center, Northwest Board. I'm actually the board chair for this year. It's an arts education organization located on Capitol Hill that provides classes as well as certification in photography.\nSpeaker 5: And then I also am a board member and the Treasurer for an organization called Apprenticeship. It's developing an apprenticeship program that's taking people that are non software engineers and moving them into software engineer field. It's a one year apprenticeship program.\nSpeaker 5: It's focused primarily on minorities, women and veterans. And so over 50% of the participants have to be in that pool. We're actually at 80% at this point. It's a Washington based program, but it's also going to be rolled out nationally, and we're in the process of doing that as well.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Good. So my understanding is that you have been serving on the Fort Culture Board already for a period of time. So can you tell us a little bit about your experience, what you've learned, and maybe what some of your interests are going forward?\nSpeaker 5: Yeah, so I have been fortunate to serve on the Finance Committee for a little over a year now, and you're not required to be a board member in order to serve on the Finance Committee. And then beginning this year, I began attending the board meetings as well.\nSpeaker 5: And so I've really enjoyed my experience thus far with for culture. It's a very rigorous process was one of the things that impacted me initially in terms of the applicants for grants, both at the arts level, the individual artist as well as the organizational level.\nSpeaker 5: And I've been impressed both with the committees that go through that initial process, the other board members that then review, ask questions and approve that, as well as the staff people and their involvement just in making sure to do diligence around that and their involvement in the arts community.\nSpeaker 5: So it's an organization that I've been extremely impressed with and it's one that I'm excited to be able to participate in.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. CASTMembers. Any other questions for Mr. James? Customer Gossett.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Madam Chair. One of the things I hear a lot from people in the community about for a culture or entity, that this was a expand culture around our county is that they don't pay enough attention to cultural relevancy.\nSpeaker 4: What does that mean to you?\nSpeaker 5: In in terms of the different art for different cultures, or how do you mean that?\nSpeaker 4: And what I was asking you, what do you think it means? Cultural relevancy.\nSpeaker 5: So I would take that to mean that is the in the culture within which somebody sees themselves and is the artwork relevant to that particular culture as opposed to a general culture or somebody else's cultural background?\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: All right. At this time, yes. I called Councilmember Lambert to move this action item. Put it before us. Thank you. I'd like to propose motion 2017 0046 with a do pass recommendation. Okay. It's moved and is before us.\nSpeaker 0: Any other comments on this action? Or if not, I will. This is a roll call vote. Well, please call the roll. Thank you, Madam Chair. Councilmember DEMBOSKY. Hi. Councilmember Dunn. Hi. Councilmember Garcia. Hi. Councilmember Colwell. Hi. Councilmember Lambert.\nSpeaker 0: Hi. Councilmember McDermott. All right. Councilmember off the ground. Councilmember one right there. Madam Chair, I. Madam Chair, in the bonus, eight eyes, no no's and councilmember phone right there. Excuse. All right, with that, we have a do pass recommendation to the full council.\nSpeaker 0: And I haven't I don't think we've done a lot of these out of this committee. Does that typically go on a consent agenda? Yes. All right. We might as well expedite it because he's been serving for a while already.\nSpeaker 0: So no need for you to come to the full council meeting. It'll be a perfunctory consent agenda item, and we look forward to formally appointing you to the board and your continued active participation. Thank you so much for serving here.\nSpeaker 0: All right. And that will move us on to briefing item number seven, which is on the future of the regional solid waste system. It sounds almost philosophical. What is the future of the regional solid waste system? So we know there's a lot of study and planning that's been going on for a while, and I look forward to\n",

Recommendation to request the city attorney to draft a resolution in support of proclaiming Long Beach a Purple Heart city.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I think, Councilman, do you want to make any additional comment at this time or just turn it over to the public?\nSpeaker 7: Yes. One of the important designations that this comes with is that anybody who comes to Long Beach will now know that the history that we have of our service men and women who have come through Long Beach, through its past history as not only a naval station, but also with our naval hospital and currently with our veterans\nSpeaker 7: hospital here in Long Beach with a designation that is pretty much like any like every other city that has a designation that's out there. Alliance Club City or a Rotary City. It's a designation that recognizes the work of these individuals who in in those organizations, but who also come to Long Beach, know that as a Purple Heart\nSpeaker 7: city, we have a history, a tradition of people who have served in our country and have committed to the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. So I would really love to have the support of my colleagues on the side of.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce. I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Lowenthal.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I appreciate that. I wanted to thank Councilmember Your Honor for asking me to co-sponsor this item and given certainly our city's role in history with World War Two as a naval shipyard, as the councilmember mentioned, an aviation manufacturer, and really our good fortune in having the veterans hospital here and Cabrillo Village is for our homeless\nSpeaker 2: vets, which I know recently we've made an effort with the mayor's help and support and leadership to expand homeless opportunities, opportunities for our homeless vets. I believe it's really appropriate that we support the designation of being a Purple Heart city.\nSpeaker 2: I'm very proud of our city and appreciate the local chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart for asking us to partner in honoring our vets. These are things that I think. We shouldn't take for granted, but we do because there isn't a single person that doesn't know someone that's served valiantly for our country.\nSpeaker 2: And I want to thank you for asking us to do this. I think it's an honor that you bestow to us. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce, thank.\nSpeaker 2: You very much. I, too, want to thank my colleague, council member Urunga, for bringing this forward. By taking this action, the city of Long Beach pays tribute to our city's sons and daughters who are wounded or killed in combat, defending the freedoms that make this nation so great for their service and sacrifice.\nSpeaker 2: They receive the Purple Heart medal as home to the former Long Beach Navy Base as the vice mayor just mentioned. It is fitting that Long Beach received the designation of a Purple Heart city. Long Beach has a proud tradition dating back many years of supporting and honoring our nation's veterans, active duty, military guards, reserves and their families\nSpeaker 2: an inherent part of the heritage, traditions, spirit and fabric of what makes Long Beach such a unique city. Thank you for bringing this item forward, and thank you for being here tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Franco.\nSpeaker 7: One more introduction that I will make that I. I would be remiss if I did not mention Mr. Terry Gatlin, the Executive Director of Gold Star Manor, where all our many of our veterans reside here in Long Beach.\nSpeaker 7: And I want I want to also recognize him as well.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And I would like to.\nSpeaker 10: Enlighten.\nSpeaker 0: People here about your.\nSpeaker 10: Nice, beautiful city here. Mayor girl mira garcia. Councilman you ranga.

Foremost, I thank you for allowing me as a representative Chapter ten at this allotted time for your council meeting. At your Council meeting. My purpose and goal at your council meeting is to attempt to familiarize those present as to why your first city has been selected to become a Purple Heart city and to procure the\nSpeaker 10: formal approval of your city council and becoming your Purple Heart. See this joining approximately 200 other recognized, established Purple Heart cities foremost, allow me to briefly acquaint you with a significant, significant history of the Purple Heart and the patriotic role your city has played during all war engagements in 1783, the concept of the badge of military matter\nSpeaker 10: was first conceived by our first president, George Washington. The recognition of honor of those who had unselfishly sacrifice themselves in war by protecting and assuring our freedoms. This unselfish sacrifice has been exemplified since World War Two by the awarding of roughly 1.9 million.\nSpeaker 10: 1.9 million. Now rename Purple Heart medals to deserving military personnel living or dead. And many of those being residents of the city of Long Beach and all having in common the unselfish service to our country and their commitment throughout the country's military conflicts.\nSpeaker 10: The City of Long Beach also has a long and proud standing history of being a strategic port of embarkation for military troops since World War One, a vital military installation for Navy and Marine personnel during World War Two, and then again becoming the port of embarkation for our departing military troops during the Korean War and Vietnam.\nSpeaker 10: The city of Long Beach at present is also the home of approximately 20,000 veterans. And viable location that the treatment for our war injured Purple Heart and non Purple Heart patients at the Long Beach Veterans Affair Medical Center.\nSpeaker 10: Therefore, bearing in mind that the Purple Heart is, as we all know, it, is only awarded for wounds received in combat inclusive of death. We are requesting that the City of Long Beach declare and designate itself a Purple Heart city, thus honoring all recipients of the Purple Heart while remaining a most patriotic city committed to the recognition\nSpeaker 10: of the services made by all our military veterans and their families. Thank you for your Council's time and indulgence in considering our request. We shall see. We response.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, sir.

Seeing none members, please go ahead and cast your vote.\nSpeaker 1: Motion passes nine zero.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much, sir. It's all. It's all done.

Mayor Garcia, Councilman Rangel, members of the city council and residents of City of Long Beach. It is my pleasure and distinct honor as commander of your established Purple Heart Chapter ten in the City language to thank you for having honored our chapter requests and this becoming your Purple Heart City.\nSpeaker 10: Therefore, on behalf of our Purple Heart Chapter two, Jane, it is.

Somebody went to jail for better mayor.\nSpeaker 3: I believe Assistant City Attorney John Lay is going to give the staff presentation tonight.\nSpeaker 2: There's been a survey. There's a staff report flashing by.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Can you hear.\nSpeaker 2: Me? Yes. Wait. Councilman, a point of order. Yes, sir.\nSpeaker 3: Do we want to do our 1030 business before we go in?\nSpeaker 2: Reporter It's.\nSpeaker 1: 11. You have to tell 11.\nSpeaker 3: We have 11.

So what we have this evening is an ordinance for introduction, amending the Sunshine Ordinance relating to special meetings. You might recall this actually started with a referral to the Open Government Commission. We went down and we got some recommendations from that and prepared an ordinance and the key features to the ordinance are an increase in\nSpeaker 3: the noticing from seven days to 12 days for all special meetings, for all boards and commissions, including the Council. It would preserve the seven day notice period for a closed session and city sponsored meetings and events. There's a carve out for emergency meetings or urgent meetings as defined in state law.\nSpeaker 3: There's also a provision trying to enhance the sort of outreach in addition to what we currently have in terms of publishing the agenda on the website. I'm talking about social media and other means. And finally, there's a minor amendment to the email list notification provision in the Sunshine Ordinance to specify that there would be notification to folks\nSpeaker 3: on the list of the meetings, special meetings, as well as agendas for both the boards and commissions and all of that of the council. And with that, I conclude my presentation and even I are available for questions.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Ley. And do we have public speakers on this, Madam Clerk?\nSpeaker 1: We have no speakers.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Any clarifying questions or any discussion? Councilmember Gullah, and they'd like to move approval. Councilmember. Vice mayor.\nSpeaker 4: Wait a second. The motion.\nSpeaker 2: Okay. Discussion.\nSpeaker 3: Councilor Verity I was going to ask the Chair if the maker of the referral approved of these changes, but since she made the motion, I won't ask.\nSpeaker 2: Those that you were. Did you work with the city attorney's office on this?\nSpeaker 0: I didn't work with them on this, but I read through and I know that they I saw the comments from the Open Government Commission and I know that they took those into account as well as our conversation. So I'm happy with the work product.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Any further discussion council? Vice mayor.\nSpeaker 4: I'll simply say I listened to I think there were two open government commission meetings on this issue and I greatly appreciate the work and thought that went into this. They really did try to meet the goal of the referral while also making trying to find ways to make sure the city had the flexibility to address issues that\nSpeaker 4: came up. And I think between the recommendation and the city attorney's office, we've come up with a really good solution.\nSpeaker 2: All right. Thank you. Okay, we're all covered.

I have proclamation number 17, dash 117 for celebrating Denver afterschool programs and the 2017 annual National Lights On After School Day. Whereas the Denver City Council recognizes that afterschool programs make a lifelong difference for kids and their parents.\nSpeaker 6: And. WHEREAS, students who regularly attend high quality afterschool programs benefit in terms of academic performance, social and emotional learning and health and wellness. And.

So I want to thank all of you for coming out and hanging out with us.\nSpeaker 6: You can come hang out every Monday if you'd like. Not a lot of head nods for that one, but we're very excited to have you today. I'm very excited to bring this proclamation forward. I have a fourth grader and a fifth grader.\nSpeaker 6: You know, I spent my career working with kids. There is no better investment than we can make as a city than in our future. And right here in front of us, we're in those awesome shirts. You are the future of our city.\nSpeaker 6: You are our future police officers and firefighters and council people and mayor and everything that we can hope and and dream for is in you. And so taking good care of you is always an important priority. I've got to work with the the Afterschool Alliance, and they just do a phenomenal job in a space that is so\nSpeaker 6: critical and so important for kids to be successful and have all of the tools that they need to succeed. And so I'm very excited to celebrate the annual National Lights On After Day School and all of our kids and the work of the Afterschool Alliance today.\nSpeaker 6: And I hope everyone will help me in supporting this proclamation. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 3: All right. Thank you, Councilman Clark. And I'll just say to the to the young folks, I when I grew up, I was a latchkey kid. I mean, my parents worked really late. And so I was dependent on all these programs and organizations to to raise me.\nSpeaker 3: And he did a pretty good job. And and not to say that my parents didn't raise me, that kind of sounded bad. But I'm telling you, I know. Please do not tell my mama whatever y'all do. But I just want to tell you how important it is.\nSpeaker 3: And I think Councilman Clark did an amazing job. But number one, we think you're beautiful. We really do. And we want to let you all know that anything that we can do to make you guys successful in this city, we will do it.\nSpeaker 3: And as a matter of fact, if you're not experiencing success, we're not successful as a city. You are our future. And so just so glad that you guys are here. And to the to the adults that are in the room, you are transforming lives.\nSpeaker 3: And thank you for your investment as well. Councilman Cashman.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 2: I just.\nSpeaker 6: Wanted to briefly echo the comments, how wonderful it is to have the kids in the.\nSpeaker 2: Chambers tonight and the.\nSpeaker 6: Importance of the.\nSpeaker 2: Proclamation that the councilman brought forward. I'm wondering where our young folks are from this evening.\nSpeaker 6: I think I think after we vote, we're going to get into we're going to be here and we'll hear we'll hear from that.\nSpeaker 2: All of them, one by one.\nSpeaker 6: One by one.

Congratulations.\nSpeaker 1: Well.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. Who's first to talk for 3 minutes, Councilman Clark.\nSpeaker 6: So first up, the first two that I will bring up are Reagans who hailed from the Denver after school alliance. And I'm going to bring up Josephine Rangel, who is a fifth grader at the Boys and Girls Club of Metro Denver, but who goes to school at Guardsman Elementary School in Luckey, District seven?\nSpeaker 6: So you two want to come up and maybe you can talk about where the other schools that are represented as well.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you so much for having us this evening. We really appreciate your time and we're thrilled to be here. And we're joined by youth from several different afterschool programs, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro, Denver Scholars Unlimited and Denver Parks and Rec.\nSpeaker 5: So thank you again to the adults and everybody coming on down here. We've got more than 26, maybe 27 kids. I better double check my head count before I leave the building. Right. Joining us this evening from grades K through five and representing a number of different districts, we've got Councilman Herndon, Councilman Clark and Councilman Brooks districts\nSpeaker 5: all here this evening. Everybody else wanted to come by. As you can tell, they're busy doing STEM programing and tutoring and arts and culture activities and whatnot. So the Denver Afterschool Alliance is the collaboration between the city and county of Denver, the Office of Children's Affairs, Denver Public Schools and more than 400 youth service organizations in every\nSpeaker 5: nook and cranny of Denver that come together in order to support afterschool and summer programs for kids. We currently are supporting 420 some odd organizations, reaching 17,000 Denver youth. So the work that we do is important. We are involved in strengthening staff practices, ensuring that we have robust data to work from filling access and gaps of opportunity\nSpeaker 5: to make sure that really there's high quality programs represented throughout the entire city and county of Denver. I'm going to have Josephine come take the microphone and she's going to tell you a little bit about what she likes about her program and why it is that she attends.\nSpeaker 4: Hi. My name is Josephine and I go to the Guardsmen, Boys and Girls Club. The Boys and Girls Club is an after school program that is offered at the school, allowing me and my friends a safe place to go.\nSpeaker 4: We get fed, we get help with homework, can interact with new people and take fun and engaging classes. I have been part of the Boys and Girls Club for four years. Sometimes we don't have time. Sometimes I don't have time to do things like homework or extra fun activities when we're at home.\nSpeaker 4: Some parents can help their kids with homework either. The Boys and Girls Club helps with this. They make you feel welcome. They help you complete your homework. If you didn't have Boys and Girls Club, you would be bored at home and wouldn't be able to interact with people much.\nSpeaker 4: Boys and Girls Club allows kids to open up and find things that they like to do at guardsman. We get to do programs we have never been able to do before, like sewing flight school, right brain or torch club.\nSpeaker 4: People really feel like they belong in the program. I really like that. They can help me with my homework. They also allow me to learn new things and get to know new people every day. There are always a lot of fun activities.\nSpeaker 4: It's really fun for me to make new friends. We also get to go on many field trips. It is really nice to have the opportunity to go places we have never been before. My favorite field trips have been a Broncos game, bike building competitions and a mid air adventures where we went ziplining and also the Denver Museum\nSpeaker 4: of Nature and Science. I have really enjoyed the Boys and Girls Club and I feel like this after school program has given me and my school many opportunities. Thank you.\nSpeaker 6: I think we found the future councilwoman of Lucky District seven. Josephine, you did a great job. Thank you guys all for coming.\nSpeaker 3: I'm sorry. I want to hear from more that. Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. You did an excellent job. Well done. All right. We have another proclamation this evening.

        "source": "Speaker 2: And well-paid workforce, it is essential that we look to our own procurement process as one path to move our local economy forward. Thus for us, this.\nSpeaker 1: Evening is an ask that we.\nSpeaker 2: Look to create a policy that ensures that major.\nSpeaker 1: City CIP.\nSpeaker 2: Projects include specific provisions for local.\nSpeaker 1: Hires, meaning mostly not out of state.\nSpeaker 2: And include.\nSpeaker 1: A training and or apprenticeship.\nSpeaker 2: Component to ensure our return is not only a new or improved physical asset.\nSpeaker 0: I.e. a new building.\nSpeaker 2: But also an enhanced workforce in effect creating a doubleheader with our public dollars. Other communities have such.\nSpeaker 1: Policies.\nSpeaker 2: And we too should look to create a policy and language. This has the potential to be the policy that keeps giving, quite frankly. So I'll make my motion here. The motion is to direct the city manager to report back to the City Council within 90 days on the development and implementation of a local workforce training and hire\nSpeaker 2: policy. This should be done again within 90 days. And you know, the city management can go look at other communities, see what they've done along these lines with regard to the policies they've adopted. You can look at examples.\nSpeaker 2: You can read review the dollar threshold.\nSpeaker 0: What dollar threshold might be put in such a policy, and some of the other points that the such a policy might include. So with that, I've made that motion. Mr. Mayor.\nSpeaker 1: Canada's a motion and a second Councilmember Austin.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I am proud to join with my colleague, Councilmember O'Donnell, in supporting this item. You know, since the beginning of the Great Recession, Long Beach has lagged, unfortunately, behind the county and the state in unemployment rates.\nSpeaker 6: Currently, we have an 8.8% unemployment rate compared to 8.2 for L.A. County, any statewide rate of 7.1 in California. And while we're spending millions of dollars to improve our infrastructure, we should support Long Beach residents, which we all support.\nSpeaker 6: Long Beach residents should be benefiting from those jobs that are created here. It's up to our city council to set the policy, and we have an opportunity to say we want our tax dollars spent wisely and benefit our residents of Long Beach who pay these taxes.\nSpeaker 6: We need to make good jobs a priority for our city, and this is a good step in the right direction. So I thank you for bringing this forward and asking and allowing me to sign on the support.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. And the third cosigner, Councilmember Lena Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 3: I also want to thank you, Councilmember O'Donnell and Councilmember Austin as well. Yes, I echoed the sentiments about that. I think this this policy and just this is a great starting point. Point as far as discussing local hire and and making sure that we're mindful in this policy.\nSpeaker 3: And so I look forward to seeing the research that comes back and look forward to working with city staff in our and our members out here in the audience as well.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilor Tauranga.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for bringing this forward. It's a very important discussion that we're having here, because as the economy moves forward, we need to look at our employment market and people who can look for jobs. And certainly we have opportunities here.\nSpeaker 5: But I also want to discuss the opportunity for others, some of our stakeholders in the city who might want to also participate in this. It's a policy, and I think that we need to look at involving other individuals in this.\nSpeaker 5: I would I would suggest that we also involve the Legal Aid Foundation. They have experience and expertize in this area that perhaps we can provide. They could provide us with someone, staff and us as a counsel with some assistance in in redrafting such a policy.\nSpeaker 5: So if there's no opposition, I would like to make a friendly amendment to that motion.\nSpeaker 2: Well, I don't know that we should specifically include or exclude any group. There'll be a variety of conversations with regard to the development of this policy. I'm open to city management talking with Legal Aid or any group, quite frankly.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Councilor Richardson.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So certainly thank you so much for bringing this forward. I think it's a great idea to begin by, you know, reaching out and seeing what we can do to spend our tax dollars wisely, as Councilmember Austin mentioned.\nSpeaker 2: I have a few questions about the process and what what you guys might have in mind, Councilmember O'Donnell, or what your approach might be. City Manager West. So based on this recommendation, it seems pretty general to me. And I remember there was a motion associated with the downtown plan a few years back that was very similar.\nSpeaker 2: You know, the motion was, Hey, why don't you come back with some recommendations, Mr. City Manager, on how to address local a local citywide local hire policy. And then a memo came back and the memo said that it wouldn't be employment, be able to be implemented here in the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 2: But this recommendation is very similar, and I want to ensure that this recommendation doesn't end up in the land loss legislation. I want to make sure that this is real and that there's a strategy. So I guess I guess the first question is.\nSpeaker 2: Ms. City Manager, how would you approach something like this?\nSpeaker 1: I couldn't answer that at this time. This is the first we're hearing about this. We if we did, the previous thing that you're talking about was just specifically identified for the downtown. I know that the council has asked for information on plays in the past.\nSpeaker 1: We have had reports on that. Last year we could resurface that. But again, I'm just interested in hearing what the council direction is so that we can go forward and heed that direction.\nSpeaker 2: Sure. So if we were to craft a policy, a citywide policy, would departments like the Port of Long Beach or the water department that that are independent authorities? Would those be governed by something like this?\nSpeaker 1: I might have to turn that over to the city attorney.\nSpeaker 2: Mayor or members of the council. Councilman Richardson. The answer to that would be no. They would need to take a separate.\nSpeaker 5: Action of their board as they have independent jurisdiction under the charter.\nSpeaker 2: Actually, I think and these are the kinds of questions we want to explore, and this is why we're kicking it into the city manager's hands. And again, I don't know that Mr. City necessarily agree to that, because what if you made it an ordinance, then it might to be applicable to those to those other organizations.\nSpeaker 2: I believe we have some other ordinances that are applicable, so we don't have to answer that question tonight as much as that's a very legitimate question. And those are the kind of questions we want to explore by sending it over to the city management team so that they can develop a potential policy and absolute responses when we\nSpeaker 2: send it over. I just want to I think he wants some direction, and I appreciate you folks bringing this on. But, you know, before we vote on it, I just want to be able to ensure that what we're voting on is real.\nSpeaker 2: What we what happened with the city met with the downtown plan. I remember it was a motion to pull out that out of the downtown plan and craft a citywide policy. So I just want to have have some clarity on what's the difference between this and that to ensure that this is a real effort.\nSpeaker 2: In addition, I'm sure that there will be a process to negotiate with, you know, stakeholders as as Councilmember Yanga mentioned. I would imagine the LLC Building Trades Council will be a part of that. I would imagine a number of the trades we're here would be a part of that.\nSpeaker 2: So I guess I'd like to better understand what that negotiation process would look like and that and understand that this motion gives the city manager the ability to go out, identify those stakeholders who are mentioned, and begin to negotiate and craft a policy.\nSpeaker 2: Then the the portion that talks about local workforce training, I think that's really important. I think that's the most impressive part of this of this recommendation. In terms of my predecessor, Councilmember Neal worked with a number of folks to try to integrate clergy and to do an outreach to Pacific Gateway and try to place folks into apprenticeships\nSpeaker 2: . I'd love for for something like this, if we're going to have this direction to really look at that pipeline, how folks, kids from North Long Beach or Central Long Beach or whatever can actually land apprenticeships and do work building our city.\nSpeaker 2: And that would be a that's a great vision. And I just want to ensure that while we have the opportunity to talk about it, we're very clear about what it is that we want to do. So again, thank you so much.\nSpeaker 2: And I think veterans is another piece we can we can look at integrating. So thank you so much for that. And I just wanted to be able to to give that that direction.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Andrews. Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, I want to.\nSpeaker 2: Thank my colleagues for really also bringing this to the floor, because this is a great policy for Long Beach to uphold. You know, the lack of jobs that hurts our city and our nation. You know, it's a part of the economic recovery.\nSpeaker 2: You know, we need more policies in place to get people back to work so they can put food on the table and so they can recover as well. So, you know, we only. I get his our.\nSpeaker 0: Neighbors and and our neighbors.\nSpeaker 2: Need our work. So this is the thing I'm really looking forward to seeing that does come to fruition. Thank you again.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Vice Mayor, I want to.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I, too, would like to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. But I also wanted to celebrate Councilmember Andrews, regardless of what project it is, every project that would come up, he would always ask for and make an amendment when appropriate for local hire.\nSpeaker 4: So you may have felt like a broken record, but it seems like the council has heard you. Sir, thank you for being that consistent voice for for local hire, which I know we could always count on Councilmember Andrews for raising that issue.\nSpeaker 4: My question when you come back, Mr. City Manager City Manager West, is if you could let us know what the dollar threshold is and what is or is not counted in that figure. That would be important when we consider what other cities have done.\nSpeaker 4: I think it was mentioned in the item that other cities have similar policies or counties or government agencies and be helpful to know what their threshold is.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. And then the other piece, Mr. City Attorney, I know that you were leaning forward to answer. I personally would like to know for our enterprise funds, whether it's the port or water or gas and oil. If it were an ordinance, would it capture those agencies as well.\nSpeaker 2: In certain.\nSpeaker 1: Departments?\nSpeaker 2: It may get to those. As Councilmember O'Donnell pointed out, the the exception would be if you're using tidelands funds or restricted funds, there may be issues with the local hire requirement, but we.\nSpeaker 5: Need to address that and look at that while we're developing a policy.\nSpeaker 2: They can. They've done it on the Joe Desmond Bridge, for example. So those can work. We just have to be able to word it carefully.\nSpeaker 5: So that it would be fit within the ordinance.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I'm going to open this up now to public comment. So please come forward and we'll start with the mayor of Carson City, Jim dear.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mayor Garcia, and distinguished.\nSpeaker 2: Members of the City Council. I'm glad to see that you're made up of a dynamic group. My established friends and my new friends. I'm here to testify before you as to our experience as your next door neighbor. The city of.\nSpeaker 6: Carson was the first.\nSpeaker 2: City after Los Angeles started a public I project labor agreement.\nSpeaker 6: Policy where some of the projects we instituted.\nSpeaker 2: An ordinance to create the place for all public funded projects that have any public money in them in the city of Carson. And our experience is it's been extremely successful. You might have read in the Beach Business Journal, the economy in Carson is now starting to take off like a rocket.\nSpeaker 2: We expect that to happen in Long Beach as well. What's good for our neighbors? Good for us. And I know that when you look at this report that would be coming back, I'm I'm sure you're going to ask your a great staff here in the city of Long Beach to bring back a report that will give you\nSpeaker 2: the adequate data and the information you need to make a wise decision. So I encourage you tonight to order your staff, direct your staff to do just that. Bring that report back to you within 90 days. And I must say that.\nSpeaker 2: Our project.\nSpeaker 6: Labor agreements in.\nSpeaker 2: Carson have created not just jobs for our residents in our city, but people that are looking for careers. And project labor agreements have projects that are coming in. Underfunded. I mean, under budget, fully funded, under budget and on time.\nSpeaker 2: And it creates a curse for people in Carson, as well as people living in Long Beach, working in Carson. So as you contemplate whether or not you should do this, think about it as a long term strategy for your community.\nSpeaker 2: You're creating jobs that are well-paying. You're creating careers for your residents. And you're creating a good future for your city. I just want to encourage you.\nSpeaker 6: To go forward.\nSpeaker 2: With the recommendation. And if you have any questions for me, I'm very easily reached by any of you. If you have any questions tonight, let me know. But otherwise, thank you very much. God bless you.\nSpeaker 0: Take me right here.\nSpeaker 1: Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening. Newly elected mayor and newly elected council and veteran councils, city staff and public, that's here today. I urge the city council to look at doing this.\nSpeaker 1: President for yourself, for the record.\nSpeaker 2: I'll get. Yes, Tom, if I represent. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 11 urged the City Council to look into a city wide project labor agreement. And across your proprietary departments, local hire a strategic local hire policy and the veterans component to it.\nSpeaker 2: I know a lot of project labor agreements that have had thresholds of local hire, disadvantaged youth, taking advantage of project labor agreement and veterans taking advantage of a play project. A lot of successes have come to it, and I'm sure when, you know, you start to negotiate it, you're going to see where the successes have come.\nSpeaker 2: City of L.A., Port of L.A., your port, the Middle Harbor, the Gerald Desmond Bridge, the airport and local cities surrounding Long Beach. So we urge you to look at doing this city wide Bill. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 2: Cast members. My name's Frederick Piedmont Brown. People call me Piedmont. I live at 1891, Britton Drive, right across the street from many Grand Elementary School, and this is quite a little bit of my background. I came to this town 35 years ago.\nSpeaker 2: I knew no one and I worked on the Wells Fargo Bank here. I did the convention center. I'm going to date myself now, the Vincent Thomas Bridge, the Badger at Avenue Bridge. And then about 17 years ago, I put my name on a ballot, and now I'm the president of the largest local ironworkers in North America thanks\nSpeaker 2: to Long Beach, to catapult me into a position where I am now and this local hire really works. We have a program for our veterans and for our female ironworkers also. So I congratulate you guys in looking at this, and I hope you move forward in the right direction.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Mr. Mayor.\nSpeaker 2: Council members. Members of the city staff. My name is Mike Covic, and.\nSpeaker 1: I also represent the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.\nSpeaker 2: I am the director of Veterans Affairs. I have behind me 32 years of honorable and faithful.\nSpeaker 1: Service to this country in the United States Marine Corps.\nSpeaker 2: I'm the former sergeant major of the first Marine Division where I led 28,000 Marines and sailors. My plea to you is I am in direct support of the citywide project labor agreement. Not only do we specifically talk about what it promotes in terms of local hires, but let's take a strong look at our military.\nSpeaker 2: Our military is downsizing.\nSpeaker 5: In its downsizing fast.\nSpeaker 2: Your sons and daughters, our sons and.\nSpeaker 6: Daughters of this community.\nSpeaker 2: Are rapidly returning back. Nothing more discouraging for them to come back home and not be able to find employment. We at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, we are keeping pace and trying and attempting to.\nSpeaker 1: Lead the way. 50% I repeat, 50% of our apprenticeship classes are.\nSpeaker 2: Currently being filled and we are moving forward to having them filled by.\nSpeaker 1: Veterans.\nSpeaker 2: Who are in fact, actually your local hires end up helping to put language into those project labor agreements to support that. Are a.\nSpeaker 1: Percentage of those people.\nSpeaker 2: Hired from.\nSpeaker 6: Local are veterans from our community.\nSpeaker 2: I know and understand all too well the dilemmas that America's heroes actually face on a daily basis. Moreover, more importantly, if we don't have the employment to support these men and women, it aggravates something else. And that's veteran homelessness.\nSpeaker 2: I just had the pleasure of attending the Unite for Veterans, and our first lady, Michelle Obama, actually intelligently spoke very, very direct and very eloquently on the fact Los Angeles County is home to some 12,000 homeless veterans. Currently, we can help exasperate and help mitigate this problem by actually encouraging and actually enforcing a citywide plea, because not\nSpeaker 2: only us in the building trades, but there are many of our other brothers and sister unions that are out there encouraging.\nSpeaker 6: Veteran hires as well to.\nSpeaker 2: In terms of their apprenticeship programs.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. And for your service, sir. Thank Speaker. Good evening. Good evening, Honorable Mayor. Ah, well, City Council.\nSpeaker 2: My name is Chris Hannon, the Los Angeles Orange County's Building Construction Trades Council. First of all, I'd like to start by thanking Councilmember O'Donnell. Councilmember Austin Councilmember Gonzalez for thinking of the Long Beach residents as a component in constructing your capital projects here in Long Beach, a career in the building trades, joining the joint labor management apprenticeship\nSpeaker 2: programs.\nSpeaker 1: 100% best thing.\nSpeaker 2: I've ever done with my life. It's available to Long Beach residents as well. The Building Trades fully supports directing the city manager to report back.\nSpeaker 1: On a local hire.\nSpeaker 2: Policy on a local workforce training policy and to remember to demand the best for Long Beach residents when you're looking at local workforce training demand. Joint Labor Management Apprenticeship Committee. This evening I have members and representatives here from IBEW Local 11 laborers, local 1309 Plumbers, U.A. Local 78 Operating Engineers, Local 12 Ironworkers, Local 433 and Sheet Metal\nSpeaker 2: Workers, Local 105 And in an effort to save a little time. You know, we're here for the same thing. You know, we encourage this and we're 100% behind you. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: And gentlemen, I just want to say, I know you represent a lot of men and women, but I wanted to say also tonight that I just want to thank you. I think we've had a great experience in Long Beach with project labor agreements.\nSpeaker 1: If you look at projects that are either happening right now or there have been completed. You guys have done a phenomenal job of ensuring that those projects were done in a responsible way. And so I think this council has had a great relationship with all of you, and I think the projects have, in most cases, come under\nSpeaker 1: budget and on time. And so thank you all for that.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. They're built to last as well.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely.\nSpeaker 0: Can I speak?\nSpeaker 1: Next Speaker.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Council members and city staff. My name is Rick Foss. I'm with the sheet metal workers. Local one of five. First of all, I want to commend you on making the motion to adopt this and move this forward for the city and city manager.\nSpeaker 6: To review and.\nSpeaker 2: Report back. But I also want to take a step further. We have an apprenticeship training program in the city of industry. I've had communication with a couple of city council members in the past and things didn't seem to work out.\nSpeaker 2: But I want to propose to you if in this 90 days, if city councils and the mayor is interested or the city manager would like to tour that facility and see that kind of training, what it takes to get in that opportunities available, be in contact with a few of you if you'd like to take that opportunity\nSpeaker 2: to research a little further rather than just how it works. Also, let's look at part of the training, and that's one of the opportunities that each city council member can can take the opportunity to view this or visit OC.\nSpeaker 2: And with that, I'm going to conclude. Thank you. Yes, sir. Good evening. I'm Wiley Baker, Jobs First Alliance. Congratulations to everyone. Completely different look tonight.\nSpeaker 0: Welcome.\nSpeaker 6: I'm here to support the project labor agreement approach. I've worked with many of these and many projects. I worked with public sector, the ports on their players, as well as the private sector, BNSF Railway, Occidental Petroleum and their facilities.\nSpeaker 6: So, you know, we know these work. The best thing about it to me is, of course, that.\nSpeaker 2: By doing it.\nSpeaker 6: You give the challenge to the contractors and labor unions to find the qualified people for you and identify those people, get them in and train them.\nSpeaker 2: It's really not that.\nSpeaker 6: Easy to gather that all together, get them tested and get them through the process. So I think that's a great benefit of having this, that you really can turn this over and it happens and you get audited. And interestingly, the 30% goals turn out to be 40 and 50% many times.\nSpeaker 6: So I think that's a great part of it. The local hire in the veteran part, in the long term unemployed, it all makes a lot of sense. I know mention of the Gerald Desmond Bridge. The challenge there I think partly was federal funding because in federal funding they don't allow that type of agreement.\nSpeaker 6: So they had to carve out the federal part. But the state and local part is there. And I'm sure if there's any.\nSpeaker 2: Challenges or.\nSpeaker 6: Issues with the State Lands Commission, it's something that we can all get our arms around and deal with with them and resolve any issues, I'm sure, going forward. Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking your time for this.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, Mr. Mayor and City Council.\nSpeaker 2: My name is Damon Skinner. I live at 800 East Cartagena Street, Long Beach. I come before you as a lifelong Long Beach resident and a construction worker. I was severely impacted.\nSpeaker 6: By the economic downturn.\nSpeaker 2: And I commend.\nSpeaker 6: Councilmember O'Donnell at bringing this forward and all the support he has received from the council. And I have nothing but support, and I can bring a lot of support from.\nSpeaker 2: My family for items that bring jobs to Long Beach and good paying jobs at that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thanks, Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name is Suzanne Brown. I'm a senior attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles in the Long Beach office. I don't want to sincerely thank the council members who brought this item before us tonight.\nSpeaker 3: It's a very exciting opportunity to hear this talk in Long Beach. I want to thank Councilmember Urunga for offering legal AIDS assistance. We have significant expertize in creating local low income housing requirements. We would welcome the opportunity to come to the table with other community partners on this.\nSpeaker 3: I want to recognize Councilmember Richardson for bringing up the fact that we have been talking about this for many years. And so it is great that finally we have something concrete moving forward. One thing that I just want to mention is that the other sort of critical piece of this discussion moving forward is an economic development policy\nSpeaker 3: for our residents, is that we not only have a local hiring component, but we have a low income or disadvantaged resident component as a targeting in the play. That's how we can really be sure that we are not just getting jobs to Long Beach residents, but that some of them will also go to those most in need\nSpeaker 3: . So I look forward to helping craft that language with the city. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and all the city council people. My name is Jack Smith. I live at 50 Elm Avenue. That's in the East Village in the second District.\nSpeaker 2: We've been here before.\nSpeaker 1: A number of times in trying to get local hires. I was a bit confused by the references constantly made.\nSpeaker 2: The previously.\nSpeaker 1: This evening with the.\nSpeaker 2: Speakers to play. I did not hear Mr. Councilwoman O'Donnell use that term.\nSpeaker 1: I think the questions of what are the.\nSpeaker 2: Threshold at which a.\nSpeaker 1: Local hire would apply is very important in this, and a play would not.\nSpeaker 2: Always apply to.\nSpeaker 1: A number of jobs in the city. Also, the devil is in the details with the instigation of Councilman Andrews and hard work by then Councilman Garcia. We got a local preference ordinance passed for housing. Loopholes. Loopholes prevented a number of Long Beach residents from taking advantage of the housing that the city taxpayers of Long Beach built.\nSpeaker 1: People from outside Long Beach moved in despite the.\nSpeaker 2: Efforts of that local.\nSpeaker 1: Preference for housing. So local preference for hiring. Every single rule has to be looked at. What's the loophole? And it has to be considered and try to close as many of those.\nSpeaker 2: Loopholes as possible.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next week, please.\nSpeaker 2: Very good. You have a courtesy to fully support the local hires. And let me suggest that we make sure that when we begin to resuscitate the marina rebuild plan, that we hire only local people to do that instead of flying people in and paying the price for it from out of out of state.\nSpeaker 2: Up in Washington, we've got a big disaster to clean up. It's going to take a lot of manpower. But we should be able to find the requisite talent here in the city of Long Beach to do that. We've got the budget.\nSpeaker 2: We've supposedly have the money for it. So money would not be an issue. And I've got to believe that we've got talent in the city of Long Beach to do that without flying them in from out of state.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. I'm going to go now. Club when more. Come, please come forward.\nSpeaker 3: I am Francis, Emily Dawson Harris and I reside in District one. And I want to commend Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez and Councilman Patrick O'Donnell, as well as Councilman Al Austin for this phenomenal jeopardized item. It's exciting and it's much needed.\nSpeaker 3: Wholeheartedly support the local workforce training and local hiring policy. When I'm out and about and I'm out and about on the basis of down the sidewalk on the metro line, and I'm everywhere, everywhere, all through the city. Although I live in District one, I consider myself a resident of several of your districts because I have a church\nSpeaker 3: home and one and friends and another and my wife. But I wanted to say, there's a tremendous need to have jobs available for people with disabilities. There are people with disabilities that do work. I don't know what percentage you're going to have in this policy to have such people that are disabled, that are able to work and\nSpeaker 3: look forward to working and should be given the opportunity to do so. Also, I speak to quite a number of young people. It's so heartbreaking that they're working two and three or four jobs, trying to go to college, trying to get an education, trying to move forward.\nSpeaker 3: So I don't know if this policy, if you can set aside a specific number for hiring for persons that are struggling and perhaps in the jobs that are there, I mean, working at McDonald's and this and that, it's not cutting it when you've got an allowance on your back.\nSpeaker 3: Sound of part of this you can look into having the availability to have jobs for people that are maybe only able to work part time, but it'll be a tremendous blessing from it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And with that, I'm going to close the public comment portion. And I do have a couple more council comments before we go to a vote. Councilmember Price.\nSpeaker 3: I am supportive of us requesting a report regarding this particular item. I do request that that staff prepare a report that's very objective in terms of the threshold standard that we're talking about. The language that was used was major projects.\nSpeaker 3: It's very important. I think, that we have a threshold that we can feel comfortable is a threshold that's reasonable and not a detriment to businesses who want to operate in the city. I think the aspects of this potential policy regarding local labor and training are absolutely positive and beneficial to our residents and our workers.\nSpeaker 3: I've actually had the opportunity to tour a lot of the facilities where our laborers are trained, and I think they do excellent work, very quality, high level work. I think that's great. But at the same time, I want to make sure that we set forth we don't set forth policies that hinder people from wanting to do business\nSpeaker 3: in the city. We have a missed opportunity if we're setting forth policies that would impact the hire ability and the the ability of a business to receive a benefit from doing business in this city. So that's very important.\nSpeaker 3: And when we're looking at comparisons with what other cities have done, I think it's very important that this report should include both the positives and the potential detriments to impacted stakeholders, including businesses and contractors who would be involved in those bids.\nSpeaker 3: So with that, thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Mongo.\nSpeaker 3: I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight. And for those of you who briefed so many of us in advance on the important issues facing the community and the opportunities, I echo some of the words that Councilmember Price stated with regard to ensuring that it's a threshold that's reasonable.\nSpeaker 3: And I hope that all of our communities will get educated on what prevailing wage is, so that when this item comes back to the council, that we're all on the same page in terms of what it means.\nSpeaker 1: Great. Thank you. Seeing no other council comment, I believe there is a motion already on the floor by Councilmember O'Donnell. And so with that, that the call for the vote, please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 2: The motion carries nine votes.\nSpeaker 1: And I keep trying to vote and I.\nSpeaker 0: Keep forgetting that I. Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And thank you all for for coming out on the item. Now we're going to go back to our regularly scheduled agenda. We had two big items to start. And so we're going to take this. Take this back and I believe we are at public comment.\n",

An ordinance relating to the city's traffic code amending sections 11.4 6.10 and 11.4 6.020 of the Seattle Invisible Code to revise permissible areas of operation and the right of way and other public pathways for electric personal assistive mobility devices and motorized scooters.\nSpeaker 6: The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Peterson, as chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to provide the committee report.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Council President Gonzales. Items 20 and 22 on today's Agenda 20 is Council Bill 119867 and 22 is 119868. Both deal with the SCOOTER program. Council member Straus is vice chair of the committee. The sponsor on those two bills.\nSpeaker 3: So I would recommend that we at least discuss those as a group, as a couple and then. We can vote on it however you want. But. Those two items go together. 20 and 22?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Madam Clerk, can you please read into the record? Item 22, so that we can have a conversation about both. But we will take up the bills separately and then they will sit on the agenda.\nSpeaker 6: Agenda Item 22 Council Bill 119868 An ordinance related relating to use of the city right of way by free floating scooters amending section 15.17 .005 of the Seattle Municipal Code, adopting a free floating scooter share program, fee schedule and ratifying and confirming certain prior acts.\nSpeaker 6: The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Peterson, back to you as chair of the committee to provide the committee report.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. So the committee recommended adoption of both of these council bills. However, Councilmember Strauss would like this. I'd like to turn it over to Councilmember Strauss, who's the sponsor of the Bills, who could speak more eloquently in favor of them than certainly I could or would.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Strauss, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Council President. Thank you, Chair Peterson. You know, we've had a robust discussion. We had a robust discussion this morning at council briefing about the scooter legislation. And first, I just really want to thank start the mayor's office, especially Joe Miller, for presenting it, the last Transportation Utilities Committee meeting.\nSpeaker 4: As I've said before, we've been engaged in a very long intellectual conversation for 18 months or longer. And I still have concerns about safety, parking, equity, how this program is used, how it will be rolled out and implemented.\nSpeaker 4: I feel that Scott is working in good faith with us, and I feel that any changes that we need to see made to the permit structure will be made. And if we don't think that the scooter legislation scooters are appropriate for Seattle after we give it a try, we can we can in the program.\nSpeaker 4: I guess my problem is, is that for so long, we've continued to circle around questions that can only be answered if we try it in the real world. It is important that we start now, as I said earlier today, because.\nSpeaker 4: Even right now. Sunset is at 730. We had sunset at 930 just two months ago. We are heading into the darker, wetter parts of the year and it's important for people to learn how to use these devices in good weather.\nSpeaker 4: Another one of the features as part of a pilot program is that the first ride must will only allow a user to travel at eight miles an hour. That is the speed that some people can run. I can't, but some people can run at eight miles an hour.\nSpeaker 4: And so. Looking at this. You know, one of my concerns was about equity. One of my concerns was about safety. And especially within this eight mile an hour issue that was that was brought up, I asked asked if we could if when we saw users using these devices, that if they needed more learning time, could we make\nSpeaker 4: that change in the permit? And they said yes. So I believe them. And so I do think that if we are going to continue having a good discussion about scooters, we need to have that discussion rooted in real life data, in real life experience, and that's why we need to move forward at this time.\nSpeaker 4: I did talk about indemnity earlier today and there is robust indemnity within the program. I do want to just cite, though, that that doesn't mean that the city will be free from any suit ever. People sue for all sorts of reasons, for cars, for bikes, for all sorts of things.\nSpeaker 4: I do want to highlight the fact that, you know, if if the issue is with the scooters, operability, scooter, scooter malfunctions, then there is robust indemnity that would ensure that the city is not liable for us. That's different than user error or if the city's infrastructure is not up to it, has has a problem that we've seen\nSpeaker 4: before with people using cars or bikes that suit the city because the city's infrastructure is not set up. And that doesn't have anything to do with scooters. That has everything to do with how we create the built environment that we want to see here in the city.\nSpeaker 4: We're going to continue seeing additional electrified micro-mobility choices. We have rad powered bikes in my district. In District six, Grandpa Bikes has had a, I believe, a very large back order during the pandemic because people are starting to move around their spaces and cities using this micro-mobility that is charged with electricity because it allows you to move\nSpeaker 4: as quickly as you need to without exerting effort that will make you sweaty when you appear at the destination that you're going to. And so this will call for a need for more bike lanes and more spaces for people to be able to travel safely with micromobility.\nSpeaker 4: And the reason that we need to move forward today and thank you, Councilmember Humble, for raising your concerns this morning. I do appreciate that we need to be thinking about this in a robust manner with a delay. Today would make the launch of this less safe because of the changing, changing weather, changing daylight as we're moving into\nSpeaker 4: fall and winter and having had an academic conversation for so long, if we're going to find the answers to these questions, if we just continue having them in an intellectual fashion, we'll just continue circling around these questions. We are at a point where we need to try this in the real world to get the answers that we\nSpeaker 4: need to these questions. And while I have concerns, I believe that those concerns will be alleviated by should we bring them up from the city council to the department. Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Chair Peterson.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Strauss Are there any other comments on item 20 or 22? Councilmember, please.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you so much. As I mentioned this morning, I did have some concerns. I still have concerns. I would have appreciated it in the week. But I do understand the position of the executive as it relates to the late date of Council's consideration.\nSpeaker 5: It would have been really great if we had received the legislation earlier. And I also want to note that the the the draft permitting requirements we only received as of the the date of the last committee meeting. And these are these are permanent requirements that, as President Gonzales said this morning, we hope to continue to to influence\nSpeaker 5: those permitting requirements even after the council acts on these on these two bills. I'm willing to vote in favor of this of this legislation at this time, despite my concerns, because I feel that my through the the work that my office has done, checking in with various advocates about the legislation, that hearing from advocates from the disabilities\nSpeaker 5: community who are the most vulnerable use users of our of our sidewalks. The fact that for instance as the arts of routine rights says that they were in touch with Joe Miller from a start as the legislation was being developed.\nSpeaker 5: They're not opposed to the legislation. They're interested in seeing how the end trip order requirements. One of the things I'm interested in as well could help resolve some of the sidewalk access issues. Marcy Carpenter, another disability rights advocate, also conversed with my with my staff about her interactions.\nSpeaker 5: It's she said it's been an open and collaborative process. And they kept insisting on a place table and they're happy with the requirements that Scott has developed for Scooter use enough to support the program pilot going forward. She's still worried about having too many scooters on the sidewalks and the sort of squishy nature of wording around who\nSpeaker 5: decides whether or not there's been a viable alternative to one riding on the sidewalk. But nevertheless, in voting in favor of these two bills, I do want to make note that there is there are some important things I believe we need to continue to emphasize.\nSpeaker 5: To start, I think it's really important that we closely monitor the trail. It's already extremely crowded. We have heard from the West Seattle bike connections about their concerns about using scooters in parks or on bike trails. And really not only feel that we need to closely monitor trails like the Elk Trail, but I'm concerned that the permit\nSpeaker 5: requirements that allow for 2 hours to address blockages is not acceptable. And I'm interested in learning more about how we can entice vendors to do geofencing in areas where it is unacceptable to drive a scooter. And then lastly, I just want to highlight, you know, again, that I appreciate Councilmember.\nSpeaker 5: I'm sorry. Council President Gonzalez mentioned this morning that we can still influence the permit requirements outside of the the legislative process. And I and I hope we find that to be true, because I think a number of us have some changes that we would we would like to request that Ascot make to those permitting requirements.\nSpeaker 5: So. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for those comments. Really appreciate it, Councilmember Peterson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. And thank you for thanks to Councilmember Strauss for shepherding this legislation. And you make a really good point about, you know, needing to try and see what's actually going to happen. I do support improved mobility options by encouraging environmentally friendly alternatives to gas powered single occupancy vehicles and ideally electric scooters.\nSpeaker 3: E-Scooters will provide an alternative for some trips for some travelers. At the same time, the city government is essentially authorizing a new mode of transportation, thousands of scooters traveling within our streets and other rights of way. So this is a big change that warrants a careful tracking of the results.\nSpeaker 3: I had been looking forward to a standard pilot project that would measure results for scooters, as we are seeing elsewhere in King County. But in my opinion, this legislation is not a detailed pilot. In my view, the legislation itself does not explicitly or fully address safety, financial liability, infrastructure costs and measures for success.\nSpeaker 3: Scott, however, made a compelling case. This legislation is time sensitive, so I fulfill my role as Transportation Committee Chair to facilitate discussion and ask questions and enable us all to vote on it. And while a majority of my colleagues approved it at committee, I was personally not willing to vote yes for something that I believe lacks these\nSpeaker 3: details. Both Council Bill 119867 and 119868 total only two pages in length. The legislation essentially cedes all the details of the program to the executive branch. So as chair of the Transportation Committee, I'll be sending a letter to our state director asking our staff to return to our committee by next June and next December to report on\nSpeaker 3: the results of the first six months and first 12 months of the new program. Those dates will give them time to assess those results for those periods of six months and 12 months. Having our staff report back to the Committee on Specific Metrics of Success, which would normally be standard for a pilot program, it will enable our\nSpeaker 3: start to give us consistent, thorough information to us as council members and of the general public on the pertinent details and results. So we can truly evaluate this new program and my conversations with Director Zimbabwe. I've been assured that the Durkan Administration also wants to measure these results of the new scooter program.\nSpeaker 3: I believe we need to measure the results to truly assess whether the program is safe, equitable and effective in getting people out of their cars and doing this without requiring tax dollars to cover injury lawsuits or to build special infrastructure that would basically subsidize the profits of private companies headquartered outside of Seattle.\nSpeaker 3: I want to thank Dr. Fred Rivera, founding director of the Harborview Injury and Prevention Center, for writing to express his concerns about scooter safety provided several studies from around the country about this. Just last week, Dallas, Texas halted their scooter program due to safety concerns.\nSpeaker 3: So this letter will encourage you to get back to us within six months and 12 months. But I still have serious concerns about introducing this new mode. Thanks.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Lewis. Thank you very much, Council President. I am really excited about this piece of legislation. As folks have said, this is a few years in the making. But first, I want to publicly acknowledge the important questions that Councilmember Herbold asked this morning.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for your questions and your comments. And I also want to publicly say I'm sorry that this morning I defaulted into a defense of the policy versus really hearing what your question was about, waiting a week to hear the impact of the lawsuits and the impact here in Seattle.\nSpeaker 0: So I want to say thank you for that and acknowledge that I defaulted into debating the merits of the policy instead of really hearing what you were saying. So thank you for all of your work on the issues to get to the heart of the questions that are being asked to us today and also for the Council\nSpeaker 0: President for sending that email to start so quickly and for Director Zimbabwe to answer those questions. I think that was all very informative in our debate today. I think that Councilmember Herbold, your your points around wanting to see the policy impacts and really the work prior to deployments of scooters about how folks can continue to maintain safe\nSpeaker 0: trails and sidewalks is going to be very important. So I look forward to working with you on that and I want to thank you for your highlighting that issue, and I absolutely support it. I also think that it's important as we look at that data, to see how this can further inform our efforts to fix our broken\nSpeaker 0: bike system and make sure that there's more areas that have protected bike lanes, truly protected bike lanes. Council Member Petersen as Chair of Transportation. I appreciate that you also outlined your concerns and the letter that you'll be sending.\nSpeaker 0: I would love to potentially work with you to include a few items in that letter as you think about ways to ensure implementation moves forward. As I mentioned, one of the things that I've had that was a concern in the past was how workers have been treated in the industry.\nSpeaker 0: But there's some really great examples out of Chicago, for example, on how to make sure that workers in this arena have the protections and benefits that places like Seattle have really fought for. So I'll look forward to potentially working with you, if possible, to include a few questions in that letter as as your draft and moving forward\nSpeaker 0: . And then lastly, I just want to thank Councilmember Strauss. You came in dedicated to this issue. I know had been working on it for quite a while, really excited to see this effort move forward even in this pilot sort of initial stage.\nSpeaker 0: Thanks for all of your work and your pre and your previous office as well, working with Council member Bagshaw and of course Councilmember O'Brien in their previous roles. I think this is all taken a thoughtful approach to making sure that we're advancing on this multimodal transportation option.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm really excited about the work that you've done here to move this this part across the line. I also want to thank Representative Macri as she was the prime sponsor of House Bill 1772 to enable more clean and equitable mobility options and climate change and mobility change challenges.\nSpeaker 0: And we received a letter from her outlining how she appreciated this piece of legislation, especially as we're dealing with multiple challenges. At the same time, it's really important to bring people to a position on a circle around a bill that creates greater stability and sustainability for our local environment.\nSpeaker 0: So really excited about the work that she did in Olympia and that this piece of legislation follows other cities, neighboring cities like Tacoma, Spokane, Portland and cities from across the globe who have advanced efforts to try to make sure that there's more micro-mobility shared options.\nSpeaker 0: And as she said, we're taking a small but important step to implement a program that will help support this the city's commitments to mobility, equity and reduce congestion. And I'm excited about the work that is in front of us yet to do so.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you so much. Looking forward to supporting this. Thank you. Councilmember was here for those remarks, Councilmember Lewis.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you so much, Madam President, and thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for bringing this forward. As someone who currently does not own a car and has not owned a car actually for almost a decade now, which is sort of interesting to reflect on since I was an undergrad.\nSpeaker 3: I am happy to support this legislation today. You know, the future of a lot more people coming up in the world who do not own cars are arranging their lives specifically in a way to be multimodal and transit oriented is going to depend on having more options and more micro-mobility options like scooters and like bike shares.\nSpeaker 3: And I think it's time that the city of Seattle tried this out and went through the process, as Councilmember Strauss has said, of essentially, literally having the rubber meets the road to see how this can work in the city of Seattle.\nSpeaker 3: I do continue to have concerns about safety, but I want to be clear. I have concerns about safety all the time. As someone who bikes regularly and has been using biking as my main method of commuting and getting around the city during COVID.\nSpeaker 3: As somebody who sees all the time as a pedestrian on a bike or the impact that myself and similarly situated bikers and pedestrians are put into by a society that relies on single occupancy vehicles for transportation. You know, safety is is a conversation that goes beyond just our conversation right now on the pilot.\nSpeaker 3: And I think it's important to center that as we continue to work towards Vision Zero and continue to work toward not just enhancing micromobility, but also increasing protective infrastructure for micromobility platforms around the city. I'm also encouraged by some of the safety measures that are baked into the plan that Assad is going to be pursuing in terms\nSpeaker 3: of the maximum speed setting, the banning of riding the scooters on sidewalks and trips, photo requirements to make sure that they're not blocking or obstructing sidewalks. This is these are really important functions that gives me confidence that the pilot can return with meaningful data to shape and guide how scooters can work in our transportation environment.\nSpeaker 3: I continue to be concerned, as I'm concerned with lots of other transportation mode discussions, but it is definitely time that we tried this. It's definitely time that we expanded the options for getting around the city of Seattle that aren't single occupancy vehicles.\nSpeaker 3: And this pilot will hopefully really lead to a great new addition, an option for people to get around the city. So I look forward to voting for this.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Lewis, are there any other comments on the bill? Either. Councilmember Strauss, please.\nSpeaker 4: Right. And I will close it out, if that's all right with you. Councilman. President, I just also want to herbal or highlight what Councilmember Herbold had said about ensuring that this program works for folks that have different ages and abilities, who might be experiencing disabilities, that we ensure that the program is set up so that we're not\nSpeaker 4: creating clutter on our sidewalks. I really want to thank Councilmember Peterson again for his letter to Scott, because the concerns that we have need to be monitored. And that's what he's requesting. And we need to see what the real world data reports, because we'll just continue circling around these questions, these intellectual questions until we have that real\nSpeaker 4: world data. And we need to ensure safety, equity and proper use are retained and that we provide people a new way to move through our city that ensures that we are transitioning away from gas powered cars and that we are able to get people the last mile between the transportation systems that we have in their homes or\nSpeaker 4: destinations where they're going. Thank you, Council President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Strauss. And thank you, everybody, for that robust conversation and really appreciate both the committee conversation and the conversation this morning in council briefing and the conversation we just had. Now, as indicated before and as I voted in committee, I intend to vote in favor of both of these bills.\nSpeaker 0: I do think it's time for us to advance the pilot program and and and begin to have conversations about the future of this mobility device in our city at a at a greater scale. And that is only possible, in my mind, by moving from the theoretical and hypothetical to, to the real world.\nSpeaker 0: And so this is an opportunity for us to do that and to learn more while still having our ongoing concerns addressed. I believe that the Department of Transportation does want this program to be successful, and I think that that is common ground with many of us on the council.\nSpeaker 0: And as a result, I think that they are, at least based on my interaction with them, very receptive to ongoing conversation and engagement and cooperation with us as council members to continue to address some of the remaining concerns that exist in the permitting in the permit requirement document, which is I think well over or close to 50\nSpeaker 0: pages, if I recall correctly, from the time that I looked at it before we went on recess. So I think that's where the details are and that's where I think there is great opportunity for us to continue to engage with Massdot around some of these lingering concerns and look forward to doing that.\nSpeaker 0: So without further ado, let's go ahead and close out debate. And I would ask that the clerk please call the role on the passage of the bill, which is agenda item 20.\nSpeaker 1: They're both. Yes. Whereas.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: Lewis. Yes. Morales. Yes. Mosquito? Yes.\nSpeaker 3: Petersen No.\nSpeaker 1: So on. Yes. Strauss.\nSpeaker 4: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Council President Gonzales. Yes. Nine in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 0: I thank you so much. The bill passes and that. Chair will sign it. Will the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf? Agenda Item 21 Will the clerk please read the short title of Agenda Item 21 into the record?\n",

        "source": "Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. And then one last announcement this past Wednesday, May 8th, was Councilwoman Neches birthday. So happy belated birthday. We're going to move on from announcements. There are no presentations and there are no communications. But we do have one proclamation this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Councilman Lopez, will you please read Proclamation 473?\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. Proclamation number 473 series of 2019 recognizing May 19th as hepatitis testing day and July 28th as World Hepatitis Day. Whereas May 19th is National Hepatitis Testing Day and July 28 as World Hepatitis Testing Day, HEP Hep C is recognized as the most common blood borne viral infection in the United States.\nSpeaker 6: And. WHEREAS, mortality due to hep C is increasing in Colorado partnership, particularly among people born between 1945 and 1965 with over 19,000 hepatitis C related deaths occur annually in the United States. And. WHEREAS, Hepatitis B accounts for almost 14,000 annual deaths in the United States, there are currently about five I'm sorry, 15,436 people in Colorado living with\nSpeaker 6: chronic unresolved hepatitis B infection, and fewer than one third of people with chronic hepatitis B are aware of their infection. And. Whereas, Hepatitis B and C cause an estimated 61% of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma. HTC and the United States and the opioid epidemic is feeling an increase in HPV and HCV positive cases, whereas hepatitis C has infected\nSpeaker 6: an estimated 50,975 Coloradans. As many as 2.7 million American residents and more than 130 million people worldwide, and is a leading cause of cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver transplants in the United States. And. Whereas, hepatitis C can be prevented, testing can identify existing infections, and early diagnosis and treatment can save lives, money and resources.\nSpeaker 6: And. Whereas, Liver Health Connection is available as a statewide resource for education testing, linkage to care, patient navigation helpline and other support services. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one at the city, the Denver City Council agrees that preventing and treating viral hepatitis as an important public health\nSpeaker 6: initiative that will improve the quality of life for Denver residents affected by the virus. Section two The Denver City Council proclaims May 19th as hepatitis testing day and recognizes July 28 as World Hepatitis Day. Section three, the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall attest and affects the seal of the city and county of Denver\nSpeaker 6: to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to Nancy for executive director of the Liver Health Connection.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Your motion to adopt.\nSpeaker 6: I move that proclamation 473 series of 2019 be adopted.\nSpeaker 0: Has been moved and seconded comments by members of council and Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. Every year I have the honor to bring this forward. I think we've carried it since 2009, perhaps every every year. And it's absolutely critical that this that this proclamation come across our desk and in these chambers, because hep-C is absent, there's a cure and it's preventable.\nSpeaker 6: And the more people that we get out, particularly the high risk populations to understand Hep C and especially our young people and especially folks that get tested, it's absolutely critical we can prevent these deaths. There's been a lot of research, a lot of resources and just, frankly, a lot of good education.\nSpeaker 6: I have seen, you know, I think it was Councilman Garcia at the time represented Council District One who carried this. And in his absence, he wasn't able to. And I took it on and and I took it on because it's dear to me, my grandfather, whose picture I have right here along with my grandmother, my my daughter\nSpeaker 6: , my grandfather was born in Ault, Colorado, northern Colorado. My family's from and went to go serve in World War Two. He was a beet worker and really and he went to go server and he served our country in Germany and came back injured and spent his time in Fort fought against Fort Carson.\nSpeaker 6: But he he had a blood transfusion after his injury. His Jeep had rolled over an explosive. And the folks who were in the energy besides him were killed. And he rolled over on his knee and crushed his is his his knee had an injury.\nSpeaker 6: They gave him a transfusion. We didn't know that that was the cause of his cirrhosis until he had it. And my grandfather has not been with. He played the role. My father has not been here since 2000. My second was his birthday.\nSpeaker 6: And I wish that we had the advances and the technology to be able to treat it. Early on, my grandfather would still be here with me and I would really appreciate his advice. Nowadays, they just don't make them like that anymore.\nSpeaker 6: And it's sad that my grandfather only got to see 72 years of life. There are a lot of people and we're losing our war to generation. There are a lot of baby boomers. There are a lot of folks who need to be tested.\nSpeaker 6: Everybody needs to be tested. We all should be tested for things like this. So we know and once we know that early detection, we can treat it and we can save lives because there's somebody's grandson that needs his grandfather or grandmother or mother.\nSpeaker 6: Right. And it's absolutely critical that we make this is the part of our everyday awareness. I thank you, Nancy. And I used to be the Hep C connection. So thank you all for carrying this. It's been an honor to carry this for you.\nSpeaker 6: This is my last time I'm carrying this proclamation. And I and with the same amount of energy that I carried the first time around, I'm going to ask people to please get tested. Please educate others about hep C and other viral infections like this.\nSpeaker 6: With that, I know that on. Let me see. May 19th. Are we in the web? Sorry. May 17th. C testing is going to take place free. Hep C testing is going to take place in the web building from 830 to 330.\nSpeaker 6: So we'll make sure that more information is passed on. I'll be on my website. Mr. President, I'll have Nancy come up and explain the rest of that. But thank you for allowing me to carry this proclamation one last time.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Thanks for bringing this forward. Madam Secretary, roll call. LOPEZ My.\nSpeaker 1: Black eye.\nSpeaker 0: Flynn All right.\nSpeaker 1: Gilmore, I. Herndon.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Cashman. Kenny. I knew Ortega. My assessment.\nSpeaker 3: Right.\nSpeaker 1: Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Madam Secretary, please. Because voting announced results 1111.\nSpeaker 1: Nice.\nSpeaker 0: 11 Proclamation 473 has been adopted. Councilman Lopez. Is there somebody you'd like to bring up to accept the proclamation?\nSpeaker 6: Yes. None other than Miss Nancy Steinfurth, if you want to come up.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, everyone, for your support of the resolution tonight. And thank you especially to Councilman Lopez, who's been our champion for many years. We're going to miss you. I would like to encourage everyone to join us at our event on May 17th.\nSpeaker 3: So because the Web building isn't open on Sunday, we're a Sunday. We're doing this event on Friday from 830 to 330. We're offering free testing for hepatitis C to anyone who's interested. So members of the public, people who work in the building, audience members, anyone who's watching television.\nSpeaker 3: We would love to have you come down and get tested. It's free. It is a simple, simple finger prick. We give results in 20 minutes and then we provide information on what the next steps are in the process.\nSpeaker 3: Because like a lot of viruses, this isn't a one step and you're done. You then have to have other testing. One of the great achievements of the medical field is that there is now a cure. There's actually a few cures for hepatitis C.\nSpeaker 3: It is in as short a timeframe as eight weeks with one pill a day and no side effects. And so that's a remarkable thing to be able to say. We can cure this, we can eradicate it, but you can't do it until everyone is tested.\nSpeaker 3: You had a risk factor. Some of those risk factors are getting a tattoo in an unsafe setting. People don't think about that that often. But if you are sharing works because you're doing it in a basement, well, that's kind of risky.\nSpeaker 3: So that is one of the criteria. World War. In addition to World War Two veterans, Vietnam veterans, about 10% of them have hepatitis C, and that's because they hadn't even identified the disease until 1989. And so anyone who had a blood transfusion, plasma transfusion in the field, trans transfusion, MASH unit care, that was a risk factor.\nSpeaker 3: And so that represents 10%. Over the last couple of years, the VA has treated 100,000 veterans for their hepatitis C infection, and they are committed to treating everyone who is a veteran. And so that's a great opportunity. In Colorado, the Department of Corrections is also treating everyone in the Department of Corrections that has hepatitis C.\nSpeaker 3: Unfortunately, it was as a result of a lawsuit. But hey, we'll take a win wherever we can get it. Colorado Department of Corrections will also treat everyone. And so all of these great opportunities are coming together and we hope everyone in the audience takes advantage of it.\nSpeaker 3: If you can't make it to the web building, we're also testing at Pride Fest, which is in June and then will be testing at Skyline Park on Friday, July 26. So it's not the 28th, but we figured the largest number of people would be there.\nSpeaker 3: We could get people walking up and down the mall, people out for lunch, break, etc.. And that's thanks to Councilwoman Ortega. So thank you very much for sponsoring that. I appreciate all of your support over the years. And thank you again.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. All right. That concludes our proclamations this evening. We're moving on to bills for introduction. Madam Secretary, will you please read the bills for introduction.\n",

A staff report.\nSpeaker 7: Public Works Director.\nSpeaker 4: AAM Alan Honorable Vice Chairman council members. I have a 40 minute PowerPoint presentation, but I would not do that sorry. The item before you was released for the city attorney to prepare an amendment to the Long Beach Municipal Code sections 10.2 12.010 and ten point 12.0 20 relating to the 35 mile per hour speed limit on Obispo\nSpeaker 4: Avenue and 30 mile per hour speed limit on Pine Avenue based upon the results of citywide engineering and traffic survey. Two street segments warrant a five mile per hour decrease of their existing speed limits. First location is the segment of Obispo Avenue between Harding Street and South Street, which warrants a five mile per hour decrease from its\nSpeaker 4: current posted speed limit of 35 miles to 30 miles per hour. And the second location, a segment of Pine Avenue between Willow Street and Pacific Coast Highway, which also warrants a five mile per hour decrease from its current posted speed limit of 30 miles to 25 miles per hour.\nSpeaker 4: That concludes my report. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Malloy and Councilmember Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'm pleased with the results of this study. It's going to lower the speed with all of this by avenue between Harding and South Obispo runs along to to residential neighborhoods known as the Saint Francis neighborhood in the Ramona Park neighborhood.\nSpeaker 3: It's been really important to them to improve that street. So they've had stop signs installed and now they're limiting. We're dropping the speed.

And Council Bill 119236 passed unanimously out of the Housing, Health, Energy and Workers Rights Committee. This legislation amends the housing funding policies which allow for strategic acquisition and including acquiring options by the Office of Housing for Future Affordable Housing Development.\nSpeaker 7: So to break that down, that means that the Office of Housing is able to use the Acquisition and Preservation Program resources to purchase property and secure it for critical, long term, affordable housing development opportunities. Most immediately, as you heard, that this amendment will be able to help facilitate the acquisition of two Seattle satellite owned substations by the\nSpeaker 7: Office of Housing for Future Affordable Housing Development. I think we all know that this is a critical, important step for us to take in an effort to make sure that there's more affordable housing options. It accomplishes multiple goals.\nSpeaker 7: First, increasing affordable housing locations with a near major transit investments throughout our city, and those investments that are expected to come online soon. Number two, increasing access to neighborhoods with little to no existing affordable housing options. Number three, promoting anti displacement and stabilization goals.\nSpeaker 7: And fourth, pursuing site assembly that leverages existing public property. This all means that when we see a piece of property, a piece of real estate that's on the market, we can act with urgency to make sure that the city can acquire it.\nSpeaker 7: This quickness is needed to make sure that we acquire properties that are often to too quick to go in this hot market. They go quickly and we want to make sure that the city has every tool in its tool belt to be a competitor and get those pieces of property in hand.\nSpeaker 7: At the same time, we want to make sure that all parcels of publicly owned land stay in publicly owned hands. This will help us be more equipped to make sure that we are both developing and preserving housing to meet our community's needs, especially for low income and moderate income families.\nSpeaker 7: As I mentioned this morning, I think this is an incredible addition to the work that we will be talking about later this evening in the conversation around the progressive tax and in the conversations that are ongoing around expanding MJ throughout the city.\nSpeaker 7: I want to thank the Office of Housing for working with our office, specifically Michael Maddox, and for Central Staff's work to bring this legislation forward. Thank you to Tracy and for all the work that's gone into this. I think this is a great tool.\nSpeaker 7: It might not sound very exciting acquisition of financing, but it's a really critical tool for our efforts to make sure that there's affordable housing and affordable land throughout the city.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much for the comments. Caspar Herbold.\nSpeaker 6: I just wanted to thank Councilmember Musgrave for bringing forward this amendment. I too have a Seattle City Light substation in my district that community members in the Highland Park area are very, very interested in the Office of Housing acquiring for the development of housing.\nSpeaker 6: But because of the zoning in the neighborhood, it is considered to be a site for increased zoning capacity under MSA. But even under that increased zoning, because of the the size of the parcel, there was some concern that it might not pencil out if a low income housing provider had to pay for the site acquisition as well\nSpeaker 6: . So I'm hopeful that now that we can bring some different assumptions to what the development costs will be for this particular location, the do more station, that this could be a site that the Office of Housing could look at in the future.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, good. I think we're ready to vote, so please call the roll on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 1: Johnson. Whereas macheda I. O'Brien I want I. Make sure I. Gonzalez, I. Herbold hi. President Harrell.\nSpeaker 0: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Nine in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 0: Bill passed and chair of the Senate. Please read the report. The Planning Land Use and Zoning Committee.\n",

The Bill aimed to abolish the legal excuse of \"reasonable chastisement\" when determining whether or not to prosecute someone for physically harming a child. The witnesses were Barry Hughes, Kwame Beney and Iwan Jenkins, all from the Crown Prosecution Service Cymru-Wales. The debate was based on the practicalities of implementing the Bill and the implications of the Bill on the criminal law in Wales and England. The witnesses emphasised that the Bill would afford children a degree of protection that they don't at present have, but which they would have when they attain the age of sixteen. They confirmed that there would be minor financial consequences for them and they wouldn't need to prosecute anyone. The witnesses also agreed that the removal of the \"reasonable chastisement\" would lead to a culture change.", "id": 0}
